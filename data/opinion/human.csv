Why loneliness is America's next public health crisis,"U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy placed a spotlight on America’s problem with loneliness when he declared the issue an epidemic in the spring of 2023. Murthy explained, in a letter that introduced an urgent advisory, that loneliness is far more than “just a bad feeling” and represents a major public health risk for both individuals and society. Murthy also pointed out that, although many people grew lonelier during the COVID-19 pandemic, about half of American adults had already reported experiences of loneliness even before the outbreak.

Over the past four years, researchers with Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Making Caring Common (MCC) project have been investigating the underlying causes of loneliness and in May they conducted a national survey with the company YouGov to find out what Americans had to say about the problem as well as the types of solutions they supported.

Here are some of the findings from the survey which are explained in MCC’s new report, Loneliness in America: Just the Tip of the Iceberg, authored by Milena Batanova, Richard Weissbourd, and Joseph McIntyre.

Who is lonely?

Twenty-one percent of adults in the survey reported that they had serious feelings of loneliness.

Age (Hint: it is not what you might expect.)

People between 30-44 years of age were the loneliest group — 29% of people in this age range said they were “frequently” or “always” lonely

Among 18–29-year-olds — the rate was 24%

For 45–64-year-olds, the rate was 20%

Adults aged 65 and older reported the lowest rate: 10% felt lonely

Racial and gender identity

There were no real gender differences found — men and women experienced similar rates of loneliness — nor were there major differences based on political ideology or race or ethnicity. However, adults with more than one racial identity had much higher levels of loneliness: 42% in this category reported they were lonely.

Income and education

There were notable differences between income but not education levels. Americans earning less than $30,000 a year were the loneliest — 29% in this category reported feeling lonely, while 19% of Americans earning between $50,000-100,000, and 18% of those making more than $100,000 a year said they were lonely.

What does it feel like to be lonely?

In the surgeon general’s advisory, loneliness is described as a state of mind: “a subjective distressing experience that results from perceived isolation or inadequate meaningful connections, where inadequate refers to the discrepancy or unmet need between an individual’s preferred and actual experience.”

The MCC report helps to further explain why social isolation is not the same as loneliness. For example, one person in the survey who experienced loneliness described having plenty of family members around but not feeling appreciated by them. Another person said they were “surrounded” by other people “who only are present in my life because [I] am useful” to them.

In their findings, the researchers also note what they describe as “existential loneliness,” or a “fundamental sense of disconnection from others or the world.” Of those who were lonely, for example, 65% said they felt “fundamentally separate or disconnected from others or the world,” and 57% said they were unable to share their true selves with others.

What is the relationship between mental health challenges and loneliness?

The MCC researchers found a strong correlation between loneliness and mental health concerns. In the report, 81% of adults who were lonely also said they suffered with anxiety or depression compared to 29% of those who were less lonely. They also noted a complex interaction between troubled feelings, where loneliness, anxiety, and depression all feed into each other.

What are some of the leading causes of loneliness in America, according to all who were surveyed?

Technology — 73% of those surveyed selected technology as contributing to loneliness in the country

Insufficient time with family — 66% chose this issue as a reason for loneliness in America

People are overworked or too busy or tired — 62% surveyed picked this concern

Mental health challenges that harm relationships with others — 60% of people rated this as a significant problem

Living in a society that is too individualistic — 58% named this as a cause of America’s loneliness problem

No religious or spiritual life, too much focus on one’s own feelings, and the changing nature of work — with more remote and hybrid schedules — were perceived causes of loneliness selected by around 50% of people who participated in the survey

What remedies do Americans propose to tackle loneliness?

At least three-quarters of people who were surveyed highlighted these solutions to loneliness:

Reach out to family or friends

Learn to love myself

Learn to be more forgiving of others

Find ways to help others

Other potential solutions?

Among their own recommendations, the MCC researchers stress the need to promote a culture that cares and serves others. “Collective service can provide important connections that relieve loneliness,” they state, as well as “cultivate meaning and purpose and mitigate mental health challenges.” They also urge public and private leaders to build up social infrastructure in order to help people develop meaningful relationships with others. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they wanted “more activities and fun community events,” where they live and “public spaces that are more accessible and connection-focused like green spaces and playgrounds.”"
The case for banning smartphones in schools,"As students around the United States head back to school, many are encountering a new reality — bans on their use of cellphones.

So far this year, several states have passed laws, issued orders or adopted rules to bar students from using their phones during school hours as concerns rise over their mental health. Officials point to the potential damage that access to social media and an “always online” culture may do to children.

Further, proponents of such restrictions argue that the small but ubiquitous digital devices distract students, impair learning and contribute to phone-related bullying and student fights.

What do you think?

How would you and your peers react to a cellphone ban at your school? Could a no-phone rule work? Would it be fair? Would you welcome or oppose it? Or, perhaps, does your school already have a ban?"
"What makes a good friend, according to science","A recent study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships offers new insights into what qualities we prioritize in our friends. The research finds that traits such as loyalty, reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty are deemed essential, or necessities, in friendships. Meanwhile, traits like being forgiving, sharing information, emotional intelligence, and conscientiousness about debts are considered luxuries, not essential but desirable.

Throughout history, from Aristotle to modern thinkers, the nature of friendship has been a subject of philosophical and psychological inquiry. Knowing which traits people value in friends can help researchers understand the benefits and functions of these relationships beyond mere companionship, particularly in terms of evolutionary advantages such as survival and well-being.

“I have been interested in friendship preferences since it is such an understudied area,” said study author Jessica (Jessi) D. Ayers, an assistant professor of psychological science at Boise State University. “Most traditional social psychology theories have pointed to similarity, familiarity, and physical proximity as the primary drivers of friendship initiation, and it has only been in the last 10-20 years that researchers have begun to consider individual differences in preferences that may influence who we want to become friends with.”

To identify which traits are seen as essential (necessities) and which are viewed as desirable but not essential (luxuries) in friendships, the researchers conducted two separate studies.

The first study included individuals, mostly undergraduate students, from a large public university in the Southwestern United States and employed a budget paradigm, an economic-based methodology designed to simulate decision-making under resource constraints.

Participants were tasked with creating their “perfect” friend using a hypothetical budget. Each was given a set number of “friendship tokens,” which they could allocate among various traits to enhance these characteristics in their ideal friend. These traits included loyalty, reliability, trustworthiness, honesty, forgiveness, information sharing, emotional intelligence, and conscientiousness about repaying debts.

A key aspect of this method is its use of different budget levels to mimic economic constraints: low, medium, and high. Participants assigned to the low budget condition had to make tough choices about which traits were truly essential, as their limited tokens forced them to prioritize. Conversely, those in the high budget condition could afford to invest in both necessary and luxury traits, providing a contrast to reveal which traits are luxuries.

The researchers found that traits such as loyalty, reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty emerged as fundamental necessities in friendship. These are the traits participants prioritized heavily even under financial constraints, suggesting their non-negotiable status in what constitutes a vital aspect of a friend.

On the other hand, traits like forgiveness, information sharing, emotional intelligence, and conscientiousness about repaying debts were categorized as luxuries. These traits were selected more frequently by participants who had more tokens to spend, indicating that while such traits are desirable, they are not considered essential for the friendship to exist.

The second study replicated and extended the findings of the first by employing a forced-choice paradigm with a larger sample of 449 participants. This method was designed to probe the hierarchical nature of trait preferences more deeply than the budget paradigm could.

In this study, participants faced forced-choice scenarios where they had to choose between two combinations of friend traits. Each scenario pitted different necessity traits against each other, luxury traits against each other, and necessity traits against luxury traits. This approach allowed researchers to observe which traits were consistently chosen over others, thus indicating their relative importance and confirming the necessity-luxury distinction.

For instance, a typical choice might involve deciding between a friend who is always loyal but never reliable versus a friend who is always reliable but never loyal. This method highlights which traits participants value most when directly compared, thus providing insights into the hierarchical ordering of trait preferences within the categories of necessities and luxuries.

The results from the forced-choice scenarios supported those of the budget paradigm, where necessity traits were consistently chosen over luxury traits. This consistency across different methodological approaches adds robustness to the findings, reinforcing the distinction between essential and non-essential friendship traits.

“Friendships — how we make them, what we look for, and how we maintain them — are a lot more complex than meets the eye,” Ayers told PsyPost. “We are only just beginning to understand all of the decisions that people have to make when they decide whether to initiate or maintain a friendship with another person.”

Interestingly, the study revealed minimal differences between male and female participants in their trait preferences, suggesting a general consensus across genders regarding what is fundamentally necessary versus luxurious in friendships.

“One of the biggest surprises was the lack of sex differences,” Ayers said. “Most theories of friendship have suggested that there should be sex differences in friendships/friendship preferences since men and women have faced different adaptive problems over the course of human history. Sex differences have even been shown in some previous work that I used as the basis for this investigation.”

But the study, like all research, has limitations. Its participant pool was largely collegiate, potentially skewing the applicability of its findings across different age groups and cultural backgrounds. Additionally, all traits were considered in isolation, detached from the dynamic real-world interactions that typically influence friendship formations.

“The lack of sex differences suggests there may be a major caveat to these findings,” Ayers noted. “It is possible that we did not observe any sex differences because we asked participants about their preferences for positive traits in potential friends. Since everyone can benefit from these traits, it makes sense then that we would not see sex differences in these traits but might still observe them in traits that are more differentiated by adaptive problem. It is also possible that there really aren’t sex difference in preferences, but where these sex differences actually exist is in the ways that individuals display that they possess these traits.”

The researchers suggest future studies could expand demographic inclusivity and examine how friendship trait preferences evolve over a person’s lifetime. Future research could also aim to recreate more complex social contexts to test these preferences more authentically.

“My long term goals are to continue understanding preferences in friendship initiation and maintenance, to eventually understand if violations of these preferences leads to friendship dissolution or if the story surrounding dissolution is also more complex,” Ayers said.

The study, “How do you build the perfect friend? Evidence from two forced-choice decision-making experiments,” was authored by Jessica D. Ayers, Jaimie Arona Krems, and Athena Aktipis."
The ethics of gene editing in human embryos,"Medicine is at a turning point, on the cusp of major change as disruptive technologies such as gene, RNA, and cell therapies enable scientists to approach diseases in new ways. The swiftness of this change is being driven by innovations such as CRISPR gene editing, which makes it possible to correct errors in DNA with relative ease.

Progress in this field has been so rapid that the dialogue around potential ethical, societal, and safety issues is scrambling to catch up.

This disconnect was brought into stark relief at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, held in Hong Kong in November, when exciting updates about emerging therapies were eclipsed by a disturbing announcement. He Jiankui, a Chinese researcher, claimed that he had edited the genes of two human embryos, and that they had been brought to term.

There was immediate outcry from scientists across the world, and He was subjected to intense social pressure, including the removal of his affiliations, for having allegedly disregarded ethical norms and his patients’ safety.

Yet as I. Glenn Cohen, faculty director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, has said, gene editing comes in many varieties, with many consequences. Any deep ethical discussion needs to take into account those distinctions.

Human genome editing: somatic vs. germline

The germline editing He claimed to have carried out is quite different from the somatic gene therapies that are currently changing the frontiers of medicine. While somatic gene editing affects only the patient being treated (and only some of his or her cells), germline editing affects all cells in an organism, including eggs and sperm, and so is passed on to future generations. The possible consequences of that are difficult to predict.

Somatic gene therapies involve modifying a patient’s DNA to treat or cure a disease caused by a genetic mutation. In one clinical trial, for example, scientists take blood stem cells from a patient, use CRISPR techniques to correct the genetic mutation causing them to produce defective blood cells, then infuse the “corrected” cells back into the patient, where they produce healthy hemoglobin. The treatment changes the patient’s blood cells, but not his or her sperm or eggs.

Germline human genome editing, on the other hand, alters the genome of a human embryo at its earliest stages. This may affect every cell, which means it has an impact not only on the person who may result, but possibly on his or her descendants. There are, therefore, substantial restrictions on its use.

Germline editing in a dish can help researchers figure out what the health benefits could be, and how to reduce risks. Those include targeting the wrong gene; off-target impacts, in which editing a gene might fix one problem but cause another; and mosaicism, in which only some copies of the gene are altered. For these and other reasons, the scientific community approaches germline editing with caution, and the U.S. and many other countries have substantial policy and regulatory restrictions on using germline human genome editing in people.

But many scientific leaders are asking: When the benefits are believed to outweigh the risks, and dangers can be avoided, should science consider moving forward with germline genome editing to improve human health? If the answer is yes, how can researchers do so responsibly?

CRISPR pioneer Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT responded immediately to He’s November announcement by calling for a moratorium on implanting edited embryos in humans. Later, at a public event on “Altering the Human Genome” at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), he explained why he felt it was important to wait:

“The moratorium is a pause. Society needs to figure out if we all want to do this, if this is good for society, and that takes time. If we do, we need to have guidelines first so that the people who do this work can proceed in a responsible way, with the right oversight and quality controls.”

Graphic by Judy Blomquist/Harvard Staff

Professors at the University’s schools of medicine, law, business, and government saw He’s announcement as a turning point in the discussion about heritable gene therapies and shared their perspectives on the future of this technology with the Gazette.

Here are their thoughts, issue by issue:

Bioethics

Aside from the safety risks, human genome editing poses some hefty ethical questions. For families who have watched their children suffer from devastating genetic diseases, the technology offers the hope of editing cruel mutations out of the gene pool. For those living in poverty, it is yet another way for the privileged to vault ahead. One open question is where to draw the line between disease treatment and enhancement, and how to enforce it, considering differing attitudes toward conditions such as deafness.

Robert Truog, director of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School (HMS), provided context:

“This question is not as new as it seems. Evolution progresses by random mutations in the genome, which dwarf what can be done artificially with CRISPR. These random mutations often cause serious problems, and people are born with serious defects. In addition, we have been manipulating our environment in so many ways and exposing ourselves to a lot of chemicals that cause unknown changes to our genome. If we are concerned about making precise interventions to cure disease, we should also be interested in that.

“To me, the conversation around Dr. He is not about the fundamental merits of germline gene editing, which in the long run will almost certainly be highly beneficial. Instead, it’s about the oversight of science. The concern is that with technologies that are relatively easy to use, like CRISPR, how does the scientific community regulate itself? If there’s a silver lining to this cloud, I think it is that the scientific community did pull together to be critical of this work, and took the responsibility seriously to use the tools available to them to regulate themselves.”

Business

When asked what the implications of He’s announcement are for the emerging field of precision medicine, Richard Hamermesh, faculty co-chair of the Harvard Business School/Kraft Precision Medicine Accelerator, said:

“Before we start working on embryos, we have a long way to go, and civilization has to think long and hard about it. There’s no question that gene editing technologies are potentially transformative and are the ultimate precision medicine. If you could precisely correct or delete genes that are causing problems — mutating or aberrant genes — that is the ultimate in precision. It would be so transformative for people with diseases caused by a single gene mutation, like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. Developing safe, effective ways to use gene editing to treat people with serious diseases with no known cures has so much potential to relieve suffering that it is hard to see how anyone could be against it.

“There is also commercial potential and that will drive it forward. A lot of companies are getting venture funding for interesting gene therapies, but they’re all going after tough medical conditions where there is an unmet need — [where] nothing is working — and they’re trying to find gene therapies to cure those diseases. Why should we stop trying to find cures?

“But anything where you’re going to be changing human embryos, it’s going to take a long time for us to figure out what is appropriate and what isn’t. That has to be done with great care in terms of ethics.”

Medicine

George Q. Daley is dean of HMS, the Caroline Shields Walker Professor of Medicine, and a leader in stem cell science and cancer biology. As a spokesperson for the organizing committee of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, he responded swiftly to He’s announcement in Hong Kong. Echoing those remarks, he said:

“It’s time to formulate what a clinical path to translation might look like so that we can talk about it. That does not mean that we’re ready to go into the clinic — we are not. We need to specify what the hurdles would be if one were to move forward responsibly and ethically. If you can’t surmount those hurdles, you don’t move forward.

“There are stark distinctions between editing genes in an embryo to prevent a baby from being born with sickle cell anemia and editing genes to alter the appearance or intelligence of future generations. There is a whole spectrum of considerations to be debated. The prospect includes an ultimate decision that we not go forward, that we decide that the benefits do not outweigh the costs.”

Asked how to prevent experiments like He’s while preserving academic freedom, Daley replied:

“For the past 15 years, I have been involved in efforts to establish international standards of professional conduct for stem cell research and its clinical translation, knowing full well that there could be — and has been — a growing number of independent practitioners directly marketing unproven interventions to vulnerable patients through the internet. We advocated so strongly for professional standards in an attempt to ward off the risks of an unregulated industry. Though imperfect, our efforts to encourage a common set of professional practices have been influential.

“You can’t control rogue scientists in any field. But with strongly defined guidelines for responsible professional conduct in place, such ethical violations like those of Dr. He should remain a backwater, because most practitioners will adhere to generally accepted norms. Scientists have a responsibility to come together to articulate professional standards and live by them. One has to raise the bar very high to define what the standards of safety and efficacy are, and what kind of oversight and independent judgment would be required for any approval.

“We have called for an ongoing international forum on human genome editing, and that could take many shapes. We’ve suggested that the national academies of more countries come together — the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. and the Royal Society in the U.K. are very active here — because these are the groups most likely to have the expertise to convene these kinds of discussions and keep them going.”

Law

Cohen, speaking to the legal consequences of germline human genome editing, said:

“I think we should slow down in our reaction to this case. It is not clear that the U.S. needs to react to Dr. He’s announcement with regulation. The FDA [Food and Drug Administration] already has a strong policy on germline gene editing in place. A rider in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 — since renewed — would have blocked the very same clinical application of human germline editing He announced, had it been attempted in the U.S.

“The scientific community has responded in the way I’d have liked it to. There is a difference between ‘governance’ and ‘self-governance.’ Where government uses law, the scientific community uses peer review, public censure, promotions, university affiliations, and funding to regulate themselves. In China, in Dr. He’s case, you have someone who’s (allegedly) broken national law and scientific conventions. That doesn’t mean you should halt research being done by everyone who’s law-abiding.

“Public policy or ethical discussion that’s divorced from how science is progressing is problematic. You need to bring everyone together to have robust discussions. I’m optimistic that this is happening, and has happened. It’s very hard to deal with a transnational problem with national legislation, but it would be great to reach international consensus on this subject. These efforts might not succeed, but ultimately they are worth pursuing.”

Science

Professor Kevin Eggan of Harvard’s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology said, “The question we should focus on is: Will this be safe and help the health of a child? Can we demonstrate that we can fix a mutation that will cause a terrible health problem, accurately and without the risk of harming their potential child? If the answer is yes, then I believe germline human genome editing is likely to gain acceptance in time.

“There could be situations where it could help a couple, but the risks of something going wrong are real. But at this point, it would be impossible to make a risk-benefit calculation in a responsible manner for that couple. Before we could ever move toward the clinic, the scientific community must come to a consensus on how to measure success, and how to measure off-target effects in animal models.

“Even as recently as this past spring and fall, the results of animal studies using CRISPR — the same techniques Dr. He claimed to have used — generated a lot of confusion. There is disagreement about both the quality of the data and how to interpret it. Until we can come to agreement about what the results of animal experiments mean, how could we possibly move forward with people?

“As happened in England with mitochondrial replacement therapy, we should be able to come to both a scientific and a societal consensus of when and how this approach should be used. That’s missing.”

According to Catherine Racowsky, professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, constraints on the use of embryos in federally funded research pose barriers to studying the risks and benefits of germline editing in humans. She added:

“Until the work is done, carefully and with tight oversight, to understand any off-target effects of replacing or removing a particular gene, it is inappropriate to apply the technology in the clinical field. My understanding of Dr. He’s case is that there wasn’t a known condition in these embryos, and by editing the genes involved with HIV infection, he could also have increased the risks of susceptibility to influenza and West Nile viruses.

“We need a sound oversight framework, and it needs to be established globally. This is a technology that holds enormous promise, and it is likely to be applied to the embryo, but it should only be applied for clinical purposes after the right work has been done. That means we must have consensus on what applications are acceptable, that we have appropriate regulatory oversight, and, perhaps most importantly, that it is safe. The only way we’re going to be able to determine that these standards are met is to proceed cautiously, with reassessments of the societal and health benefits and the risks.”

Asked about public dialogue around germline human genome editing, George Church, Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at HMS, said:

“With in vitro fertilization (IVF), ‘test tube babies’ was an intentionally scary term. But after Louise Brown, the first IVF baby, was born healthy 40 years ago, attitudes changed radically. Ethics flipped 180 degrees, from it being a horrifying idea to being unacceptable to prevent parents from having children by this new method. If these edited twins are proven healthy, very different discussions will arise. For example, is a rate of 900,000 deaths from HIV infection per year a greater risk than West Nile virus, or influenza? How effective is each vaccine?”

Science, technology, and society

Sheila Jasanoff, founding director of the Science, Technology, and Society program at HKS, has been calling for a “global observatory” on gene editing, an international network of scholars and organizations dedicated to promoting exchange across disciplinary and cultural divides. She said:

“The notion that the only thing we should care about is the risk to individuals is very American. So far, the debate has been fixated on potential physical harm to individuals, and not anything else. This is not a formulation shared with other countries in the world, including practically all of Europe. Considerations of risk have equally to do with societal risk. That includes the notion of the family, and what it means to have a ‘designer baby.’

“These were not diseased babies Dr. He was trying to cure. The motivation for the intervention was that they live in a country with a high stigma attached to HIV/AIDS, and the father had it and agreed to the intervention because he wanted to keep his children from contracting AIDS. AIDS shaming is a fact of life in China, and now it won’t be applied to these children. So, are we going to decide that it’s OK to edit as-yet-to-be children to cater to this particular idea of a society?

“It’s been said that ‘the genie is out of the bottle’ with germline human genome editing. I just don’t think that’s true. After all, we have succeeded in keeping ‘nuclear’ inside the bottle. Humanity doesn’t lack the will, intelligence, or creativity to come up with ways for using technology for good and not ill.

“We don’t require students to learn the moral dimensions of science and technology, and that has to change. I think we face similar challenges in robotics, artificial intelligence, and all kinds of frontier fields that have the potential to change not just individuals but the entirety of what it means to be a human being.

“Science has this huge advantage over most professional thought in that it has a universal language. Scientists can hop from lab to lab internationally in a way that lawyers cannot because laws are written in many languages and don’t translate easily. It takes a very long time for people to understand each other across these boundaries. A foundational concept for human dignity? It would not be the same thing between cultures.

“I would like to see a ‘global observatory’ that goes beyond gene editing and addresses emerging technologies more broadly.”

Can AI ever replace therapists?,"Source: David D. Luxton

Behavioral health chatbots now provide therapeutic services that would otherwise have required a professional to offer. Woebot Heath’s chatbot Woebot, for example, was granted “Breakthrough Device Designation” by the FDA in 2021 for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD). The app’s conversational agent (the AI part that allows it to converse in a dialogue) uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques while establishing an empathetic therapeutic relationship. Even more groundbreaking and disruptive is the arrival of generative AI and the use of Large Language Models, such as those available from Open AI’s ChatGPT. The interactive capabilities of this commercially available technology can now be connected to virtual human avatars, enabling real-time conversation and access to general and domain-specific knowledge that was not possible just a couple of years ago.

I’ve heard colleagues say that AI will not replace human professionals but will augment what psychologists do. There is nothing to fear, they say. While I agree AI can and does augment what we do, the reality of supplanting psychologists and other healthcare professionals on a large scale is closer than ever. Psychologists perform many roles and tasks, of course, but I think the one most people are considering, and I’m focusing on, is interactive therapy services (i.e., psychotherapy and consultation).

I first wrote on this topic a decade ago in an article in Professional Psychology: Research and Practice called “Artificial Intelligence in Psychological Practice: Current and Future Applications and Implications."" I wrote then that the only things keeping intelligent machines from replacing human care providers were the technology limitations of the day (e.g., primarily computational power), which we would overcome. The regulatory, legal, ethics, and safety issues professionals must consider could be worked out.

In that article, I also wrote that AI systems could be far superior in their capabilities. I proposed the “super clinician,” an AI system integrating advanced technologies to create all-new capabilities. The super clinician is a highly realistic virtual human simulation with natural language and speech processing for human-like verbal interaction. The system would also have advanced sensors and signal processing capabilities, such as voice sentiment analysis and high-speed digital cameras or infrared sensing, to detect blood flow indicative of heartbeat and thus distress and affective states. The system would also be connected to all other available client data, such as electronic health care records, personal files, and Internet mobile phone use, that it could use to tailor its therapeutic approach, build rapport, and predict behavior and outcomes. The system would be perfect in its interaction, empathetic, and never make an error unless those errors were intentional to make the virtual clinician appear more human-like. Well, the super clinician is entirely possible with existing technologies. Take a look at these systems from USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies. Should you be worried?

I think the answer to this question may depend on another question: Should we, from a societal perspective, from a professional perspective, and the public’s perspective, allow this technological capability to become the new standard of practice?

I attempt to address this from a more philosophical and morals perspective in another paper, “Recommendations for the Ethical Use and Design of Artificial Intelligent Care Providers,” in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. In it, I argue that we should be careful about replacing humans with machines in this area. A primary concern of mine is that people will no longer have a choice for human interaction (i.e., to see a human therapist or counselor) because insurance companies, employers, or the government will mandate the use of AI machines and not allow traditional, and more expensive, human-to-human services. Giving up real human interaction and connection for synthetic relationships may also cause harm to people and society. This harm can come from various issues, such as loss of privacy, trust, manipulation, and overreliance on machines in moral decision-making. While some data indicate that people may prefer disclosing personal information to machines because they appear to be more private or less biased than a person may be, I think we stand to lose something inherent to our profession and society with a machine-only option: real human-to-human interaction and relationships built on trust.

While psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, social workers, and other behavioral health professionals are at risk of losing their jobs to intelligent machines, there are also opportunities for these professionals to be involved in the ethical development and use of these technologies. Psychologists are involved in AI research, develop treatments with emerging technologies, and advocate for the rights of the people they serve. Nonetheless, current and forthcoming developments in AI are destined to alter the behavioral health landscape in the years ahead.

AI technologies, such as therapeutic chatbots and virtual human care providers, do provide benefits for society. They offer access to mental and behavioral health services that may not be available or feasible for some people. They have the potential to provide services that are more reliable and efficient. The increase of persons with untreated mental health conditions in the U.S. and worldwide presents a considerable opportunity and motivation to bring these technologies to the marketplace. But like with other technologies (such as nuclear bombs, genetically modified viruses, or social media), just because you can build something doesn’t mean you should do so senselessly or without wisdom. We must consider the implications of AI and other technologies on people and society and always place people first by respecting their dignity, autonomy, and humanity.

Why sleep is more important than you think,"Source: StockAsso/Shutterstock

In a culture like ours, in which long work hours are expected and pleasurable nonstop distractions abound, sound sleep is often hard to come by. Our society promotes hard work as a path to happiness and self-fulfillment, and many people believe they can learn how to get by on little sleep with no ill effects.

No wonder so many of us are sleep-deprived. Data indicate that more than 30 percent of adults and 90 percent of teenagers get less than the recommended amount of nightly sleep. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in three U.S. adults reported not getting enough rest or sleep every day. Nearly 40 percent of adults report falling asleep during the day without meaning to at least once a month, and an estimated 50 to 70 million Americans have ongoing sleep disorders.

This is problematic because sleep problems have been linked in the literature to a host of negative outcomes, including injuries, loss of productivity, and poor decision-making, as well as many chronic health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and an overall greater likelihood of death. An extensive NIH report (2006) concludes: “After decades of research, the case can be confidently made that sleep loss and sleep disorders have profound and widespread effects on human health.”

Sleep, in other words, is more important than most people appreciate.

Sleep and Psychological Well-Being

Psychologists have long been particularly interested in the link between sleep and psychological well-being. A vast literature has accumulated attesting to the link between sleep and emotion. Yet sleep is a complex and mysterious process, the intricacies of which are yet to be fully understood. Sleep problems, for example, come in various forms that may not have similar effects. Moreover, some aspects of emotional health and well-being may be more vulnerable to sleep disruptions than others.

A recent (2023) article by Cara Palmer of Montana State University and colleagues seeks to offer some clarity on the effects of various sleep deficiencies on emotional health. The authors meticulously reviewed findings from more than 50 years (1966-2022) of sleep research to assess the impact of troubled sleep on various facets of mental health and functioning. Their study “represents the largest, most comprehensive meta-analysis to date quantifying the impact of sleep loss on domains of human emotional functioning.” The authors looked at three distinct sleep issues:

Sleep deprivation, measured by studies that ask participants to stay awake for extended periods with no intermittent periods of sleep. Sleep restriction, measured by studies that shorten typical sleep duration for one or more nights. Sleep fragmentation, measured in studies that force awakenings during a night of sleep.

The authors focused on studies that measured the effects of sleep problems on several important emotional outcomes, including positive and negative affect, general mood disturbance (in studies that did not measure positive and negative emotions separately), emotional reactivity (valence and arousal), anxiety, and depressive symptoms.

The authors included in their review only studies in which participants were free of psychiatric or sleep-disorder diagnosis as well as any medical conditions known to impact sleep and/or emotional functioning. They included only experimental studies with adequate control groups and those that measured at least one emotion-related dependent (outcome) variable.

Overall, the final meta-analysis included 146 peer-reviewed studies and eight unpublished studies or data sets (e.g., dissertations) with a total number of 5,717 participants across 28 countries.

Findings From a Review of Research

Eighty-five studies looked at sleep deprivation (SD). Results showed that SD influenced mood (increased negative and reduced positive emotion and increased general mood disturbance) and anxiety but had no significant effect on depressive symptoms. The effects on emotion and anxiety showed a dose-response relationship—that is, more wakeful hours led to more disrupted emotion.

Fifty-six studies looked at sleep restriction (SR). Like SD, SR had a significant effect on both positive and negative emotions, as well as mood disturbance and anxiety outcomes, with dose-response effects for positive emotion. “Positive affect decreased gradually as sleep duration decreased. The largest deficits in positive affect occurred around 4 hours of sleep.” SR was also found to affect depression.

Twenty-one of the included studies used sleep fragmentation (SF). SF was found to be linked to decreased positive affect and decreased arousal.

The authors conclude:

“The strongest and most consistent effects of sleep loss were observed for decreased positive affect, followed by increased anxiety symptoms, and blunted arousal in response to emotional stimuli. Effects on other emotional outcomes were varied and less consistent… All forms of sleep loss, including SD, SR, and SF, reduced positive affect, with the largest effect size found for SD… These findings should inform regulations and policies that directly impact sleep–wake patterns including maximum work periods and schedules (e.g., for surgeons, truck drivers), school start times, military/combat operations, daylight savings time, and investment in education and health care that prioritizes sleep.”

The review contains several limitations. For one, sleep studies by nature find it difficult to fully mask participants to their condition, which may have produced expectancy effects.

Moreover, lab experiments are inherently low on what psychologists call ""ecological validity,"" because conditions in the lab do not resemble real-world conditions. In addition, the literature reviewed mostly relied on young adult samples, which may not represent the population at large. Further, existing studies relied mostly on subjective reports rather than objective measurements of emotional states.

Finally, other aspects of sleep that were not addressed in this review may be important to consider as we hone our understanding of sleep and its health effects. For example, a recent study (2024) by Australian psychologist Daniel Windred and colleagues suggests that sleep regularity, rather than sleep duration, is key for predicting future health.

Still, the bottom line from converging sources of evidence is that adequate, uninterrupted, regular sleep is an essential agent of emotional and physical well-being. The good news is that potent behavioral interventions for improving sleep exist, and improved sleep can often be achieved without much expense, delay, or noxious side effects.

Bang for your buck, protecting your sleep is without a doubt among the best things you can do to improve and maintain your mental health and well-being. Psychologists should regularly include sleep hygiene assessment and intervention in their care plans. If your psychologist does not inquire about your sleep habits, they are not providing you with top-notch care.

Every year for six years, Laureen Wamaitha hoped that her fields in Kenya would flourish. Every year, she’d see drought wither the crops and then floods wash them away. The cycle of optimism and loss left her constantly anxious, and she blamed climate change. “You get to a situation where you have panic attacks because you’re always worried about something,” she says.

How to rebuild trust in American institutions,"Only 1 in 5 Americans trust the federal government—so how do we restore public confidence?

For more than two decades, the Partnership for Public Service has worked across presidential administrations to provide federal employees, leaders, and agencies with insights, training, and research to better serve the public. Through these efforts, and by improving the narrative around our federal institutions, the Partnership seeks to build a more trusted and trustworthy government—and a stronger democracy.

Nonprofit and nonpartisan, the Partnership believes the health of our democracy depends on the relationship between our government and those it serves. Paul Hitlin, a senior manager at the Partnership, lays out five foundational strategies to help improve this relationship and reignite public trust in government.

1. Showcase individual federal employees.

When Americans hear the term “government,” they often think of elected officials in Washington, D.C. However, more than 2 million professional, nonpartisan federal employees make up the bulk of our government—80% of whom work outside the Washington, D.C., area. The public views these civil servants more positively than the government as a whole. Fully 46% of the public say they trust civil servants, 50% believe most civil servants are “committed to helping people like me,” and 55% think civil servants are competent.

Agencies need to highlight these employees to correct common misconceptions about who works in government and what they do. This approach would resonate with the public.

People want to hear more positive stories about our government, and individuals respond well to personalized stories of high-achieving federal employees who make a difference, as we’ve learned through reactions to the Partnership's Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals program. These awards, given every year, honor outstanding career civil servants who seldom receive public recognition.

2. Make the government more transparent and accountable to the public.

Today, just 15% of Americans believe the government is transparent, and less than half believe it is accountable to the public, with many Americans viewing the government as opaque and disproportionately influenced by powerful and secret interests.

There is no silver bullet for changing these perceptions, but certain improvements would help. Agencies should make data on how well they serve the people more available and easier to understand. Elected officials and government leaders need to be agile and responsive to the public’s concerns. Agencies should simplify the process for removing federal employees who do not meet their obligations to the public, while ensuring that career civil servants—hired based on their skills and required to be nonpartisan—are not fired for politically motivated reasons.

3. Develop modern, customer-friendly services.

When encountering many common federal services, the public is largely satisfied with them. At least 70% of the people who applied for a passport, filed for Social Security, passed through an airport security checkpoint, or applied for Medicare said they were satisfied with the experience.

Still, just 21% of Americans believe the government listens to the public, and only 23% think federal services are easy to navigate.

To reverse these trends, all federal employees should be held accountable for meeting customer needs, and agencies should develop processes that make it easier to collect and share customer feedback. Congress needs to work with agencies to invest in, and do more training on, emerging technology that would enable easier-to-use digital services.

4. Improve federal leadership.

Good leaders are the most critical factors to our government’s success and impact.

Government leaders must develop innovative solutions to complex problems, motivate their workforce, and hold their teams accountable for delivering critical services to the public. However, unlike organizations within the private sector and the military, the federal government does not have a systematic, deliberate approach to developing and supporting leaders.

All federal executives and managers, including political appointees, need to meet a standard for leadership that holds them accountable for running high-performing agencies. Agencies should adopt a framework, similar to the one developed by the Partnership, that requires federal leaders to not only hold technical expertise but also manage healthy agencies and teams and be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.

5. Reconnect with young people.

Just 15% of Americans ages 18-34 trust the government, the lowest of any age group in our survey, and nearly 70% think the government does not communicate effectively with them.

Agencies need to do a better job of engaging with this demographic, emphasizing the power of federal service on local communities—a theme that would resonate with young adults—and featuring success stories of young people in government.

The government also needs to draw more young people into public service. Today, people under 30 compose just 7.5% of the federal workforce but about 20% of the broader labor market. Agencies and Congress need to work together to simplify the government’s complex hiring process, increase the use of federal internships, and find new ways to convert interns into full-time employees, all of which would help young people better connect with the federal government."
The hidden costs of working from home,"I remember a cold, rainy November day in 2011.

Our team at DoubleDutch was tiny, and we had been grinding, racing towards a January launch. We were exhausted, and needed to catch a breath. Pankaj, Nick and I jumped in Pank’s car and went down to Sunflower Vietnamese on 16th Street, and brought back six steaming bowls of pho ga for the team (randomly, I remember that one of the containers melted and warped in the car, as the soup was so hot!) We jammed into our one, tiny little conference room, drank our soup and ate our noodles, and just hung out. The rain was coming down outside, but we were warm and content.

It was a moment for us.

A moment jammed in between hard work, scheduled meetings, and the daily grind of startup life. But it was a moment nonetheless; one of countless team moments that I believe contributed to our collective passion, loyalty, and drive for the company, not to mention lifelong friendships.

But today, in 2020, in the face of a global pandemic, these sorts of unscheduled, serendipitous moments have been taken away.

Many companies have gone Remote First, and many of those might never come all the way back. Office life has been replaced by remote work, and the countless random collisions and conversations that used to happen around the proverbial water cooler have vanished.

This is the cost of remote work. A loss of connectivity, a loss of the glue that holds teams together, a loss of trust, and a loss of humanity. I suspect that these costs will soon become more quantifiable in the form of increased attrition and lower productivity.

One possible takeaway is that this is just one of the costs of our new reality. There is lots to like about remote work; no commutes, more flexibility, athleisure (!). Of course there are going to be some costs as well?

But if you talk to the folks that are experts in Remote First, they don’t think it has to be this way. I recently got the chance to hear from folks who have been Remote First even before the pandemic; people like Sid Sijbrandij at GitLab, Wade Foster from Zapier, and Job van der Voort from Remote.com.

According to these people, the loss of human connectivity doesn’t have to be a cost of remote work. But, as an organization, you have to be one more intentional about carving out time and space for serendipitous connections to happen.

Remote.com does “Bonding Calls” with a guided question of the day, multiple times a week. No agenda, just camaraderie and bonding. They play video games together - every employee gets an Oculus. The executives do random pulse checks with their team - informal catch ups with no agenda that allow execs and employees to recreate random encounters that used to happen in the hall or at lunch or via office hours.

The Gitlab CEO believes that office based, IRL networking is a positive (“the ONLY case for an office”) but limited - you tend to only meet the people on your floor, or in your region. If you are intentional about it, digital can be an even more powerful way to connect your people, as you are not bound by geography and space. They have 20 different ways that they attempt to intentionally drive this sort of serendipity, documented in their employee handbook.

So for companies new to Remote First, is there hope to preserve the serendipity of those countless random yet meaningful collisions that happen around and between scheduled meetings?

The good news is that a new breed of remote inspired companies and products are trying to help. Companies like mmhmm and here.fm are fun ways to inject some personality into your video calls. Donut is an easy Slack plugin that matches employees for impromptu meetups. The Go Game and Unlock are building fun virtual activities to connect Remote First teams. Sidekick is building always on hardware to attempt to recreate presence. And my company, twine, is going deep on a serendipity engine to facilitate one to one connections around meaningful topics.

A reset as massive as a Covid-inspired the move towards Remote First and will have many, many unexpected consequences. As many of my most meaningful relationships in my life have come from the workplace, I am eager to see how Remote First companies attempt to preserve the serendipitous moments that lead to these connections."
What your attachment style says about your politics,"No one in the United States knows what November 6th will bring, but one thing is sure, and that is that many people are highly activated and experiencing fear and anxiety. And, it may seem obvious, but many politicians embrace this level of social activation. But that activation affects people at a very personal level.

It is important to remember that anxiety and fear activate the attachment system.

Attachment theory has now been backed by more than sixty years of research and is well validated. It shows how the attachment system developed as an evolutionary adaptation that kept young humans close enough to their parents and elders so that they could attain protection and security in the face of environmental threats. What keeps people close enough to get to these secure bases of support is anxiety. When people are out exploring the environment, anxiety builds and builds until it becomes so uncomfortable that it impels them to run back to their secure base for comfort and support.

The attachment system was not designed for modern political battles, which, so far (with obvious exceptions) have been predominantly intellectual.

The attachment system does not differentiate between physical threats and implied or imagined ones. As explained in the last paragraph, when the attachment system is activated, it impels people to establish proximity to their attachment figures. And this is what many politicians count on. Attachment figures are usually parents, romantic partners, or close personal friends, but some of the worlds greatest attachment theorists have recognized that attachment figures can be symbolic.

A symbolic attachment figure can be an institution or political figure, even one you may never have met.

But, psychologically this person comes to represent something that can protect you from threats and decrease your anxiety. The symbolic attachment figure raises anxiety by giving the message that the world is a scary place full of endless threats to your security. And, if you move closer to them, by supporting and voting for them, they will keep you safe.

Now think about this: if the threat is decreased, and anxiety abates, the attachment system deactivates and people go into an exploratory phase… where they venture away from the attachment figure to explore the environment and other ideas. This is obviously something that many politicians do not want to happen. If people feel comfortable and secure enough to explore the environment, meet with other people, and entertain new ideas, they may drift off and support other politicians of schools of thought… not something that they typical politician wants to happen. So, they have to keep the threats and fear alive. But, people habituate to a certain level of threat, so simple ideas and policies as threats start to lose their ability to scare people and instill anxiety. So, politicians have to up their game and move closer and closer to convincing people of real physical threats.

And, here we have a problem. Attachment systems are a natural phenomenon. They can be understood and even harnessed, but they cannot be predicted or controlled at the level of the individual. When attachment styles are activated, they can bring out the worst in the 45% of the population with insecure attachment styles. An attachment style is a personality trait that acts like a computer program. It filters incoming information and predicts how people characteristically think, feel, and behave, particularly about social situations. There are three commonly accepted insecure attachment styles. When activated, those with avoidant/dismissing styles are likely to suppress their own feelings of vulnerability and their empathy for others. They are likely to become hyper-competitive and closed to new ideas. Those with anxious/preoccupied styles may become hypervigilant for threats, have difficulty letting go of their anger, and lash out in defense or in retaliation for perceived wrongs. Those with disorganized/fearful styles may become emotionally dysregulated, volatile, and unpredictable.

This situation has the potential to damage relationships between people if not to impel even more destructive behaviors. So, how do we respond to this situation?

Simply reassure each other and let time pass.

It looks like ideas and political arguments are what the conflict is all about, but once the attachment system gets activated, the conflict becomes an emotional one. Emotional conflicts are not fixed by using rational arguments and debate. So, the debates go on and the rational arguments escalate, but the conflict remains, and the emotional pain and fear continue.

So, my recommendation is to stop.

See what happens on Tuesday and then pause, turn off the news, stop debating, and simply reassure each other that everything is going to be okay. Don’t just reassure people in your tribe; reassure those others too. Let some time pass. Let the attachment system deactivate and let yourself and your friends return to your natural state of exploring the world, other people, and new ideas."
Why we need to teach philosophy in high school,"The Case for Philosophy in America’s High Schools

Adolescents are a skeptical lot. Anything and everything are fair game to them, and woe betide what is found wanting. Criticism comes easily to these professional skeptics. Irreverence is natural when one is taking the world’s measure, cutting one’s teeth, and finding oneself.

American high schools, however, waste this irreverence by failing to harness and turn it to educational use. By not providing programs which could tap into this natural resource, they forgo their most valuable asset — the intellectual restlessness of youth itself.

By barring this critical spirit from the classroom, high schools are saying to students that questioning is wrong and will have no place in their education. If they want it, they must get it on their own. This is the message high schools often convey.

This is regrettable, since what could be an opportunity to exploit, develop, and sharpen this critical temper is irresponsibly allowed to run into the sand.

Not that schools should become coliseums where intellectual gladiators slay their opponents, but training grounds where students could learn to think for themselves for the rest of their lives.

The study of philosophy is one such program which American high schools could introduce to channel this skepticism toward academic ends. This would not be a course which would indoctrinate students into the tenets of a particular school of thought and show why schools which disagree are wrong. Nor would it be a history of philosophy which surveys major figures and movements.

Rather, it would be a course which would engage students directly by asking questions: Does life have a meaning and purpose, and how do we know? What is truth and how do we know that we have it since truth and illusion feel the same way? Does truth change over time? Are beliefs the creations of our subjective needs? Do human beings have value? Can we know anything beyond this world?

Such a course would consider the various answers which have been advanced to these and similar questions over the centuries; seek to understand the historical era in which each answer arose; empathize with each of them; and analyze their respective arguments, objections, and rebuttals.

By observing how each answer qualifies, complements, or critiques the others, students would explore not only specific questions and their answers, but also the nature of critical thinking itself. Students would learn how to detect fallacies in logical reasoning; how to dissect and refute faulty arguments; how to determine what can and cannot be proven; in short, how to think, rather than what to think.

The course would be offered as a senior elective. Books wouldn’t be used; one’s humanity would be enough. Books distract students from their own thinking. While they would profitably be read later, initial reliance on them might suggest to students that their own ideas weren’t worth considering, when that would be the point of the course.

This dependence on books could weaken trust in their own judgment when the essence of philosophy is learning to commune with oneself, groping in darkness, and struggling for insight. Only lastly is it the reading of books.

There would also be a minimum of teacher lecture, apart from setting up each question and guiding discussion, which would be the heart of the course. There would be no heresy in class; students would be free to say whatever they wished, provided they supported it. The course would take no position on anything, but simply consider the options so that students could have an intelligent basis upon which to decide for themselves.

While one might, in principle, agree with the desirability of such a course, five objections suggest themselves:

(1.) “Philosophy is unnecessary in high school since it is already taught in college.”

By that logic, the study of English, history, mathematics, and science would also be unnecessary in high school, since they too are taught in college. If four years of learning these subjects in high school aren’t enough for learning these disciplines, why would it be any different with philosophy when students would only have an initial grounding as they do in these other high-school subjects? Students would have two choices in college: take additional courses in philosophy or learn something else.

Not all high-school students go to college, especially at today’s sticker-shock prices. A high-school philosophy course might therefore be some students’ only chance for such an experience. Learning to think for themselves and to be tolerant toward ideas different from their own would be invaluable training for life.

Moreover, waiting until college to take philosophy would prove too late for most students. Critical thinking must be nurtured early in life; otherwise, the habit of accepting ideas uncritically becomes too ingrained to overcome. The longer one waits, the more difficult it is to discard old habits. Better to start early since philosophy and critical thinking would prepare students for college, where they would already have what most freshmen lack their first day on campus — the ability to think critically

(2.) “Philosophy is too advanced for high-school seniors.”

Philosophy is simply the asking of questions. It is looking at life and asking why. What could be more relevant to seniors who are already asking the big questions of life? However, many of them are perplexed by these questions to a degree seldom realized by adults who have made their peace with these questions decades ago. They hesitate to discuss these questions with parents and are hard put to find educational contexts which deal with them. So, they discuss them with friends, who are equally puzzled.

A philosophy course would help students sort themselves out, make them realize that these questions were part of a centuries-old tradition of what it means to be human, and reassure them that they weren’t alone in their search for meaning. The clarity reached in these matters would enable them to see themselves and their concerns within a much broader context. By consolidating their position on these ultimate questions, they would be consolidating themselves as human beings.

Some students don’t feel challenged by conventional high-school courses. They find traditional subjects necessary but unimportant since they fail to address the philosophical questions that preoccupy them. American education’s commitment to pluralism would suggest that we help these students. In recognizing different kinds of students with different needs and abilities, we should provide different kinds of programs to meet these needs, philosophy being one of them.

(3.) “High school already teaches critical thinking.

On the contrary, high school doesn’t teach critical thinking for two reasons: lack of time, community distrust of critical thought, and large classes.

Philosophy, on the other hand, is critical thinking applied to questions of meaning and values with real-life consequences. It wields the scalpel of doubt in an explicit, self-conscious, and rigorous way, and students exposed to its method learn to wield it themselves. It is a technical skill which requires much time, practice, and effort, and students who haven’t learned to think critically or engage in critical discussions have a difficult time in college.

The skepticism of many students is often only a vague feeling that something is wrong with a line of reasoning. This kind of skepticism may be uncritical, rejecting as blindly as others accept; it may be simplistic, seeing things in terms of either/or, black and white, or only black; it may be undifferentiated, with no particular object on which to focus; it may be only love of contradiction, compulsive nay-saying, or denial for denial’s sake.

These forms of skepticism lack precision. They need to be structured, disciplined, and channeled before they can be honed into an intellectual tool. Philosophy can help do this on the whetstone of the world with its universe of questions.

Critical thinking isn’t appealing to authorities or following the crowd to prove one is right; nor is it insult or name-calling to prove someone is wrong. Nor does it prove that something is true because it’s old, new, or “self-evident,” or because one will profit from it, or that it makes one feel good. Nor that something is false because it’s frightening. All these reasons are fallacies.

Critical thinking is thinking for oneself by means of evidence, and this kind of skill, while taught in the sciences, is not in the humanities. This is the greatest weakness in humanities programs.

(4.) “Philosophy is an educational frill.”

While high school does provide students with some of the knowledge necessary for life, it is a rare high school graduate who can think critically. High school must impart the factual, the practical, and the essential survival kit of basic skills, but if it imparts no more than that, it ultimately fails its students. In teaching them not to ask questions, how not to deal with them critically, and how not to critically evaluate what they read, hear, and write, high schools produce “A” students who can memorize, but cannot think for themselves.

If the purpose of education isn’t to train the mind to think critically, what is its purpose? One would do better to leave school and educate oneself rather than be exposed to years of Groupthink. Why learn to read if one isn’t at the same time also taught how to judge what one is reading? One will only become more easily brainwashed.

Why learn to memorize facts if one isn’t also taught how to distinguish between fact and prejudice masquerading as fact? Indeed, what doesn’t contribute to these skills is an educational frill!

(5.) “Philosophy is inadvisable at the high-school level.”

Critical thinking is “inadvisable” at any level; hence, the many attempts throughout history to control and suppress it. Thought strikes at the group, casts doubt on its idols, and shakes its complacency. It is the enemy of habit and privilege, yet it persists, and whatever small progress has been made in this world has been due to its efforts.

Critical thinking may be inadvisable to some high-school students, who might feel threatened by thinking for themselves. Perhaps these students would be better off not questioning, but simply obeying, but this is a troubling prospect that could be exploited by those in power. What these students might need is a bit of courage to become their own persons.

However, there are many other students who do want to question, who want to hear all sides of an issue, and would welcome the clash of opposing ideas. Why should these students be denied the chance because of those who wouldn’t even be taking the course? To deny them this chance would be to teach them more than we realize — that, despite what we say, we really believe that critical thinking is wrong, inadvisable, and dangerous, but not just for students, but for the powerful, who would then have to face more critical voters.

By refusing to give students courses that would make them think critically, we consign them to educational limbos where they try to educate themselves in spite of their schools, a lamentable commentary on schools that should be fostering critical thinking not discouraging it. If education isn’t, ultimately, the liberation of the mind, it’s not education, but initiation-rites into the myths of one’s tribe.

With searing words and seraphic vision, Bertrand Russell memorialized for all times the power of unfettered thought: “Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth — more than ruin, more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible. Thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid.”

What should be surprising is not that a case should have to be made for philosophy in America’s high schools, but that philosophy hasn’t already become an integral part of its schools a century ago. The habits of mind instilled by philosophy constitute the essence of a liberal education. Its ideals of freedom of thought and expression are at the heart of our political traditions. Its aspirations are the foundation of Western culture. Its message has always been that truth is never afraid of scrutiny.

If students cannot learn this lesson in high school, when can they learn it? Later, when they are no longer young and receptive to learning, or when the opportunity to learn is no longer present? If we want our students to think for themselves and not be our echoes, we will rethink what education should be about and how long we can afford to exclude philosophy’s critical spirit from America’s classrooms.

Eight Reactions of High-School Seniors to Philosophy

Since it’s always advisable to give students closure at the end of a course, I always spent the last few classes helping them sort through their reactions to philosophy. However, students can sometimes better access their own reactions by indirection. This last written assignment, therefore, asked them to critically evaluate eight different reactions to philosophy. What follows are the eight reactions in bold print, followed by a summary version of their collective critique in italics.

1. Philosophy is a waste of time since it cannot give us absolute certainty. The life of the mind betrays us with empty promises. We feel disappointed, cheated, disillusioned and demoralized.

Most students found this an overreaction. A little “disappointed,” perhaps, which would gradually wear off, but hardly “cheated, disillusioned and demoralized.” In general, they dismissed this reaction as naïve, since no one could realistically expect that philosophy could bring certainty about the big questions of life. Those wanting certainty from philosophy are really looking for magic, not honest answers. Philosophy isn’t, after all, mathematics with right and wrong answers, but a manner of thinking, a critical tool for examining theories. It’s not a what, but a how.

The fact that philosophy enables one to see through deception and nonsense is liberation enough from systems of thought that take over the mind with ready-made answers. Such “mind-forged manacles” are nothing but Groupthink, which spares one the anguish of finding one’s own answers. How could learning to protect oneself against indoctrination be wasting one’s time? On the contrary, philosophy saves one from being brainwashed and wasting one’s life!

2. “Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.” Since we cannot have certainty, isn’t it better to enjoy ourselves by a life of pleasure, rather than throwing away our lives in pointless speculation? If we’re going to be food for worms, what does it matter what we think about the eternal questions?

This is simply an excuse for living a life of excess rather than one of dignity. It goes from one extreme to another — from wanting unattainable certainty from philosophy to self-dissipation. Why take out one’s disappointment on oneself by putting oneself in an early grave? If anyone is throwing away one’s life it’s certainly not someone who’s trying to lead a meaningful life, but someone who’s seeking one’s self-destruction.

And who has certainties in this world about anything? A life of certainty would be too boringly safe! If one is here today and gone tomorrow, then why not enjoy the good things of life in moderation? Why make one’s life miserable simply because one cannot be certain? It seems such a childishly extreme reaction with no sense of proportion.

3. Since we cannot have certainty about life’s ultimate questions, isn’t it better to stay with the answers we grew up with? At least we’re familiar with them and perhaps even happy. Since we cannot prove anything anyway, why not simply keep what we have?

These are the thoughts of a slug and a coward. Who’s to say that the ideas one grows up with are true or make one happy? They could very well be false and make one miserable. Anyone in any culture could make the same case about staying with inherited answers, but how could all those different answers be true? This sounds like what a PR man would say to defend the status quo of his culture. But if one feels unhappy with traditional answers, why not reject them? Staying with what one was brought up with is just fear of the unknown and lack of initiative in taking charge of one’s life.

4. Life must be lived, not endlessly pondered. The real world demands decisions, not fruitless discussion. Too much thinking brings paralysis and gets us nowhere. Let us simply move on by immersing ourselves in life’s practicalities.

This misrepresents what philosophy does. Of course, life must be lived, but philosophy keeps one from living blindly and winding up in a ditch. It allows one to live life more intelligently by thinking more deeply about the stakes involved. Life demands constant decisions, and what better way of proceeding than by first weighing the options and choosing what’s best, which philosophy helps one to do.

What causes paralysis isn’t too much thinking, but not thinking at all. One simply drifts and waits for Godot to solve all one’s problems. When despair becomes overwhelming, one retreats to inaction instead of rallying oneself.

Philosophy is life’s faithful companion that enhances one’s enjoyment of life by living it wisely, rather than simply submitting to whatever happens and calling it fate. It counsels one to change things and to make one’s own fate. Immersing oneself in practicalities brings a healthy balance to life, but a life of all practicalities can make one a drudge. “Everything in moderation”!

5. We live for ourselves, our families, our jobs, and our careers. We become involved in causes, interests, hobbies, politics, or whatever brings happiness. We lose ourselves in the joys of the here and now.

While this, too, is commendable, the problem lies in its all-inclusiveness. It’s healthy to embrace all these good things, but, again, it seems an overreaction. Philosophy isn’t an either/or choice of having either philosophy or family, but one of both/and, having both good things to live for and philosophy’s added dimension of insuring that these good things remain good.

Someone who is only about the here-and-now can become too addicted to the moment to the exclusion of the larger picture. Anything, no matter how good, can be abused and become a way of escaping oneself and the awareness of any higher significance. Philosophy keeps life’s larger dimensions in constant perspective.

6. We continue to search for answers and nourish ourselves on questions. We make our peace with open-endedness. If certainty isn’t attainable, we make do with probability or possibility. In the process, we grow. It is the journey, not the destination which is the goal. And if we are wrong, then we are wrong, and there is dignity in making our own mistakes and not someone else’s.

This seems fine on the surface — keeping one’s options open in order to grow like Jack Kerouac’s being always “On the Road,” never settling down, staying eternally young, and being always in motion like a rolling stone for fear of being defined by any one view. However, this Journey-not-the-Destination motif can lead to too contemplative a way of relating to life, becoming a passive observer, and avoiding life’s responsibilities altogether by being everything in potential, but nothing in actuality.

One should, after all, finally grow up and take a stand, not waffle on the important questions of life. Granted, some see fixed beliefs as prison cells that stifle growth, so they shed old beliefs as snakes do old skins, while others feel uneasy with such eternal becoming that can become its own prison cell. Perhaps it’s a matter of temperament as to which choice is right.

7. We aren’t interested in theories for their truth, but for their utility or enjoyment. We “try on” different world views as so many lenses through which to savor the world. We enjoy these theories or answers for the aesthetic or emotional pleasure they bring. They are mental “as if” games that reveal different faces of the world to us.

Some dismissed this as a cowardly mind-game for avoiding reality. One doesn’t take anything seriously, but simply redefines it out of existence to cope with a world one cannot control. By adopting a series of different attitudes (of a Stoic, an Epicurean, an Existentialist, a Marxist, Freudian, Jungian, or whoever), one distracts oneself from what one should be reacting to by relishing the subjective reactions that come with these attitudes.

One prefers one’s subjective mood states induced by these poses instead of being concerned with dealing with what one is actually confronting. Others took exception to such a negative view and found this “as if” approach an exciting way of relating to the different aspects of a Protean reality which these “lenses” reveal so that one could broaden one’s world.

8. We need something absolute to believe in to give our lives meaning. We want tradition, ritual, ceremony, pageantry, mystery, and faith to provide us with true, objective, and eternal answers. It is only in surrender that we find ultimate peace and liberation.

This struck some as the highest wisdom and a beautiful vision that brought infinite comfort to those who believed it; others saw it as the reaction of a theater person in love with make-believe and the ritualized existence of playing a part in some mystery play of cosmic yearning, which refused to accept the joys of this world for those one hoped might exist in the next.

One needed the stage-props of a romanticized past and tradition to steady oneself in the mundane world of the present, which one was loath to accept as it is. Others felt that one could find religious transcendence in poetry, as others find their poetry in religion.

It was apparent in discussing their reactions that some students found it hard to accept that there are no universally agreed-upon answers to the questions of life; that a number of plausible answers exist to those questions; and that some questions may not even admit of an answer. These students seemed somewhat forlorn.

There were also students who found the uncertainty engendered by philosophical questioning initially unsettling, but as the year progressed and they encountered the dozens of theories about the myriad topics discussed, they seemed relieved and liberated, eager to push on, without fear or commitment, to the boundless reaches of the possible. They had tasted of the Tree of Knowledge and felt themselves joyfully banished from the Garden of Innocence and were ready to take their chances with whatever might come.

Most heartening to their teacher was the courage of these young seekers of wisdom in exploring the uncharted seas into which their Odyssean journey had taken them. Two traits stood out by the end of each year: the radiant glow of young minds in ferment, and the possession of that rarest Pearl of Great Price — being grounded in themselves to follow knowledge like a sinking star, beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

Final Thoughts on Teaching Philosophy to High-School Seniors

I always presented a number of theories about every question raised in the course. There were so many questions that students gradually realized that the life of the mind was a turbulent night sea journey upon wave after wave of endless questions.

The more one explores them, the more one is overawed by their immensity and the utter inadequacy of our makeshift answers. The secret of teaching is asking questions. Questions and theories open the mind; answers only shut it again.

Lecturing to high-school students is the kiss of death, but if you want students to think, ask questions, many of them, relentless, rapid-fire, follow-up questions that give them no quarter.

Ask questions that drive them to the brink — and then abandon them there. Resolve nothing. If things are too clear, you have failed them as a teacher.

At other times, ask open-ended questions with much time to think, so that the magnitude of these philosophical questions can be palpably felt. There is a kind of thinking that needs vagueness and shadow for the answers to come, answers that need darkness to slowly develop.

Teach students to struggle and wait for the answers especially to life, which is always the best teacher and comes with no book of instructions or answer key.

On the temple at Delphi were inscribed the words: “Know Thyself,” to which Oscar Wilde wittily replied: “Only the shallow know themselves,” because there is so little depth.

Philosophy begins in wonder and mystery and, if one is lucky, may end there, too.

Why nostalgia is making a comeback,"Let’s expand on why 90s and 2000s trends are dominating across different cultural dimensions and how they’re shaping today’s landscape.

Technology’s Role in Reviving Nostalgia

Social Media Amplification: Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are the driving forces behind the resurgence of 90s and 2000s culture. Hashtags like #Y2Kfashion or #90sKids have millions of posts, filled with nostalgic content like outfit recreations, old TV show clips, and even tutorials on how to style 90s makeup. Influencers and celebrities showcasing these trends to younger audiences ensure their relevance in today’s world.

Streaming Platforms: The accessibility of older TV shows, movies, and music through streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify has made it easier for younger generations to engage with and fall in love with 90s and 2000s culture. For example, Friends saw a massive resurgence in popularity after becoming available on Netflix, attracting an entirely new fanbase.

Resale Platforms: Vintage and secondhand shopping on apps like Depop, Poshmark, and even eBay has contributed to the revival. Authentic pieces from brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Levi’s, and Juicy Couture are now more accessible, feeding into the desire for genuine 90s and Y2K aesthetics.

The Economic Aspect of Nostalgia

In times of economic uncertainty, nostalgic products and trends often see a spike. Why? They tap into emotional security, offering people comfort during financial stress. Consumers may find more value in revisiting styles or media they already know and trust, rather than experimenting with something entirely new.

Nostalgia also fuels “affordable luxury” – items that feel indulgent but are accessible. A re-released pair of Air Jordans, for example, might evoke memories of childhood dreams, giving consumers an emotional reason to invest in something they might not usually splurge on.

Nostalgia in Marketing

Brands are heavily leveraging nostalgia to connect with consumers. By evoking the past, they build emotional ties to their products. Some examples include:

PepsiCo’s Throwback Campaigns: Reintroducing retro packaging for products like Mountain Dew and Pepsi.

Nike’s Air Max Revival: Bringing back iconic sneaker designs from the 90s and early 2000s.

McDonald’s Happy Meal for Adults: Featuring classic toys like the Hamburglar or Grimace, targeting millennials who grew up with them.

These campaigns aren’t just marketing ploys – they’re cultural experiences that make consumers feel seen and valued.

The Influence of Celebrity Culture

Celebrities play a huge role in reviving and legitimizing nostalgic trends:

Fashion Icons: Bella Hadid, Dua Lipa, and Kylie Jenner have made 90s and Y2K styles cool again. Their bold choices, such as pairing low-rise jeans with crop tops or wearing mini baguette bags, have catapulted these trends back into mainstream fashion.

Their bold choices, such as pairing low-rise jeans with crop tops or wearing mini baguette bags, have catapulted these trends back into mainstream fashion. Musical Nostalgia: Artists like Olivia Rodrigo blend 2000s pop-punk influences with modern music, paying homage to legends like Avril Lavigne. Similarly, Taylor Swift’s re-recording of her old albums has reignited fans’ love for her early music.

The Blurring of Generations

Interestingly, the nostalgia for 90s and 2000s trends isn’t limited to millennials who grew up during that era. Gen Z has adopted these styles and cultural markers with enthusiasm. To them, these trends represent something new and exciting – unlike millennials, who view them as a comforting return to their roots.

The interplay between these generations creates a feedback loop: Millennials revive old trends, and Gen Z adapts them, adding fresh twists and interpretations that give the past a contemporary edge.

The Future of Nostalgia

As the 90s and early 2000s continue to shape modern culture, their influence is likely to evolve. Here’s what to watch for:

Hybrid Trends: Expect to see more blending of 90s/2000s aesthetics with current technology and innovation, like VR-inspired fashion or nostalgic video games reimagined with immersive experiences. Sustainability-Driven Revival: The rise of thrift shopping and upcycling will keep vintage items in circulation, making nostalgia more eco-friendly. Deeper Nostalgic Layers: As trends from the late 90s and early 2000s peak, we might see earlier decades – like the mid-2000s “MySpace Emo” era – rise next.

Why Nostalgia Never Fades

The power of nostalgia lies in its ability to connect us to a time when life felt simpler. It bridges generational gaps, comforts us in difficult times, and reminds us of who we are. The return of 90s and 2000s trends isn’t just about fashion or entertainment – it’s about finding joy in the familiar while navigating an unpredictable world.

In the end, the past isn’t just a memory – it’s a resource. And for now, we’re tapping into it with all the butterfly clips, platform sneakers, and TRL-era playlists we can handle."
