I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"S.E. Cupp is the author of ""Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,"" co-author of ""Why You're Wrong About the Right"" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.

Boston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.

Until I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.

I'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.

The pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)

The pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.

As Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.

""Even before the dawn of social media,"" they write, ""adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist.""

So true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, naÃÂ¯ve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.

But while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to ""go viral"") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?

Now that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?

I could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a ""socially-adept"" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.

Looking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.

I'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.

I think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.

There's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.

When we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).

Of course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to ""just ignore them"" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.

As difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.

Being 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.",human
The coronavirus pandemic is closing schools. How will kids eat?,"(CNN) A school district in New York has canceled classes and activities until next week because a faculty member contracted the novel coronavirus.

Seattle Public Schools, near the epicenter of an outbreak in Washington, says a staff member tested positive for the virus this week, triggering closures for a minimum of 14 days.

And another district nearby has closed for up to two weeks and transitioned to ""online learning"" because a parent in the district has also contracted the disease.

But as other schools deliberate shutting their doors to slow the spread of the coronavirus, some parents may be left to wonder: If schools close, how will my child eat?

Across the United States, millions of students rely on school lunches, more than 20 million of which are distributed for free each day, according to the US Department of Agriculture

If classes are canceled, figuring out how to provide those meals to students is a challenge, with a web of federal rules governing when and where students can receive food.

While regulators have eased some of those restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, school closures remain ""an evolving situation with many unknowns and complex considerations that vary from one community to the next,"" said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association.

Federal waivers relax rules for coronavirus closures

When schools close unexpectedly -- during a pandemic , for example -- the USDA allows them to provide food to students using programs designed for summer meals, which are often offered at churches, parks and other community sites.

Schools can then be reimbursed by the federal government for the meals they provide, just as they would be during the summer, according to a USDA memorandum issued last year.

The catch, according to the School Nutrition Association, is that the meal distribution sites, including unused schools, must be located in areas where at least half of children come from low-income families.

Using those sites is a ""first step that gives schools in many low income communities the option to continue some form of meal service during coronavirus school closures,"" but the reality is that ""needy students live in all communities,"" said Pratt-Heavner, whose group represents school nutrition professionals.

Underscoring the complex bureaucracy that governs school lunches, meals distributed during unexpected closures also typically have to be eaten in "" congregate feeding "" sites intended to encourage community bonding.

But federal health officials have warned that students should avoid eating in large groups during the coronavirus outbreak, and the USDA issued waivers this past weekend to allow to-go meals in two states hardest hit by the coronavirus epidemic, California and Washington.

Sack lunches and grab-and-go foods

In Washington, a state that has seen more than 200 coronavirus cases, the Northshore School District has moved classes online because a parent tested positive for the coronavirus.

The district, which said it would not have in-person classes for up to two weeks, is offering meals for pick up at 22 school sites. Five production sites are making grab-and-go meals, according to Juliana Fisher, the district's director of food and nutrition services.

And while school closures are always a last resort, some of the nation's largest districts are also making plans to feed students if the coronavirus forces them to shut down.

Not far from the early epicenter of the US outbreak, for example, Seattle Public Schools prepared ""to provide sack lunches prepared by staff in our central kitchen,"" according to Tim Robinson, a spokesperson for the district.

The NYC Department of Education, which serves more than a million students, said that ""if a school is closed for 24 hours, we're prepared to serve grab-and-go breakfast and lunch for any student who wants it,"" according to spokesperson Miranda Barbot.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools, also one of the nation's largest school systems, said it would work with state and federal officials to ""ensure that students in any affected schools are provided with the meals they have come to depend on,"" according to spokesperson Jackie Calzadilla.

And Chicago Public Schools, which currently has one school closed, has ""established a special hotline and email for those families who need support with meals or have additional questions,"" said Emily Bolton, a district spokesperson.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Many schools are preparing to provide meals during potential coronavirus closures. But what those will look in practice -- especially if closures are widespread and prolonged -- remains to be seen.

In California, for example, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Unified School District, Shannon Haber, said that schools are operating normally. But ""we are planning for everything,"" she said. ""Meals to students included.""

Asked how meals would be distributed and what parents can expect, though, her response was brief: ""I have no further information at this time.""",human
US-Mexico border: Pregnant woman from Guatemala dies after fall from wall,"Image copyright Joe Raedle/Getty Image caption Section of the US-Mexico border near El Paso, Texas

A 19-year-old pregnant woman from Guatemala died from injuries suffered after falling from the US-Mexico border wall, US and Guatemalan officials say.

Miriam Stephany GirÃÂ³n Luna fell as she tried to climb the steel mesh barrier near El Paso, Texas on Saturday.

She was taken to hospital where doctors tried to deliver the baby by emergency C-section without success.

Officials say the case indicates a change in how migrants are trying to reach the US amid new restrictions.

President Donald Trump has made the fight against illegal migration to the US a major policy issue and has taken measures to deter entry across the border from Mexico, including plans for a border wall. Large sections of the border near El Paso already have some form of barrier.

GirÃÂ³n Luna was travelling with a 26-year-old man believed to be her partner and the baby's father, and fell more than 6m (19ft), Guatemala's foreign ministry said on Thursday (in Spanish). The man eventually found US border patrol agents, who called for an ambulance to rescue her.

According to the statement, GirÃÂ³n Luna was taken to a hospital in El Paso with a cerebral haemorrhage, liver and kidney lacerations and a pelvis fracture. She underwent multiple surgeries but died from her injuries on Tuesday.

The Guatemalan statement said she was seven months pregnant while US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said she was eight months.

Gloria Chavez, CBP's El Paso sector chief, blamed the death on ""human smugglers"" who had ""encouraged her and helped her climb"" the barrier. ""We will engage our law enforcement partners in Mexico to find those responsible for placing these lives in danger,"" she said in a statement.

Media reports said GirÃÂ³n Luna was a social worker and beauty pageant winner and wanted to reach the US to help her family financially.

Tens of thousands of people from Guatemala and neighbouring El Salvador and Honduras have tried to enter the US in recent years with many saying they are facing violence and poverty.

Image copyright Johan Ordonez/AFP Image caption A group of Guatemalan migrants deported from the US arrived in Guatemala City on Thursday

The number of Guatemalans trying to climb the US-Mexico border wall rose recently because they no longer surrender to US border patrol, Tekandi Paniagua Flores, the Guatemalan consul in Del Rio, Texas, told the Associated Press news agency.

That is because changes implemented by the US government, including the Remain in Mexico policy that forces asylum seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico until a decision on their cases is reached, have made it more difficult for many people to remain in the US once they are caught.

The man who was travelling with GirÃÂ³n Luna is under US custody. Guatemala's foreign ministry said it had started the process to repatriate GirÃÂ³n Luna's body.

An Online Generation Redefines Mourning,"Meanwhile, Ã¢ÂÂGirls,Ã¢ÂÂ the HBO show about young people making their way in modern-day Brooklyn, has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season, first when Hannah HorvathÃ¢ÂÂs e-book editor, David, is found dead in the Hudson River. Ã¢ÂÂDo you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Horvath asks her editorÃ¢ÂÂs widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)

The show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. Ã¢ÂÂWhy arenÃ¢ÂÂt you mourning quietly?Ã¢ÂÂ asks Adam, HannahÃ¢ÂÂs boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editorÃ¢ÂÂs obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called Ã¢ÂÂAnd Now TheyÃ¢ÂÂre Dead.Ã¢ÂÂ Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer LÃ¢ÂÂWren ScottÃ¢ÂÂs suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.

Ms. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, Ã¢ÂÂHow can I really help?Ã¢ÂÂ It would be great if everyone said, Ã¢ÂÂCan I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ

Last February, on what would have been Ms. RosenthalÃ¢ÂÂs 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friendÃ¢ÂÂs Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of what she wrote wasnÃ¢ÂÂt true,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Feldman said. Ã¢ÂÂBeccaÃ¢ÂÂs mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. FeldmanÃ¢ÂÂs explanation for that kind of behavior is Ã¢ÂÂperformative grief,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, adding: Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, Ã¢ÂÂlook at meÃ¢ÂÂ behavior.Ã¢ÂÂ On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, Ã¢ÂÂ said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.

Then thereÃ¢ÂÂs the lingua franca of social media Ã¢ÂÂ the like button Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs totally discordant with death. Ã¢ÂÂMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing Ã¢ÂÂ136 people like thisÃ¢ÂÂ underneath?Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a Ã¢ÂÂsympathize button,Ã¢ÂÂ something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.)",human
"In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism","Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) As America approaches the end of Donald Trump's first year as President , one point on which the entire country can agree is that this has been a year like no other in the nation's history. If the polls are to be believed, most of us see Trump's presidency so far as a slow-motion calamity.

And yet, not every development in the last year has been negative. The Trump presidency has energized the country and given it a new mood of seriousness.

It has reminded America about its priorities and caused its people to ponder important questions. Even if he has done so unwittingly, we can thank President Trump for bringing some exciting changes to the country. Here are five of Donald Trump's greatest unintentional accomplishments.

Sparking the women's movement and a conversation about decency

It all started before he came into office, when voters heard and saw how he talked to and about women. We heard the women who accused him of sexual harassment; we saw how he disparaged women on the campaign trail ; and we saw that he became President in spite of it all.

On the day after the inauguration, millions of women took to the streets around the world to make it clear that women would not sit back and watch Trump's style become the new normal. The women's march became likely the largest single day demonstration in US history.

And that was just the beginning. As the backlash against sexism has continued, courageous women revealed the extent of abuse they have experienced in all facets of life. The #MeToo movement took down some of the most prominent figures in journalism, entertainment, politics and elsewhere. And the tsunami against abuse is still raging.

It's no wonder ""feminism"" is Merriam-Webster's word of the year, its most searched term.

And the best is still to come.

The next elections should bring a tide of women to public office. EMILY's List, the group that helps women political candidates, reportedly says last year it had heard from about 1,000 women interested in getting its support. This year, the number skyrocketed to 22,000

Killing apathy

Trump's presidency has electrified the country, creating a sense of energy and urgency unlike anything the United States had seen in at least a generation. Today, even people who routinely muttered, ""I hate politics,"" and stayed uninvolved, are bristling with political thoughts and following the latest news about Trump's legislative agenda, the Russia investigation, and matters as obscure as the gap between what Trump says and what his secretary of state argues.

Americans have discovered that political apathy is a luxury better left to people living in countries where they trust their government.

Raising the question: What really makes America great?

As soon as he took office, Trump started trying to enact the agenda that he claimed would Make America Great Again. But to millions of Americans, Trump's agenda and rhetoric seemed to highlight precisely the opposite.

Trump forced many who had not given the matter much thought to consider what exactly it is that makes America great: its pursuit of ideals such as respect for the individual, for a free press, for equality; and the sacred notion of ""rule of law,"" that no individual, however powerful, stands above the law or should wield his power to interfere with justice.

Trump helped us understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism is love for one's country. It compels us to protect those characteristics that make it worth loving, and to strive to bring the country closer to its ideals. Nationalism, on the other hand, is what Trump preaches in his MAGA creed. It is an attitude of superiority, tainted with notions of ethnic and religious supremacy.

Reinvigorating journalism

When historians look back at the Trump era, they will note that Trump spawned a golden age of journalism. Even as Trump declared war on the media, casting doubt on any piece of news he found unflattering by calling it ""fake news,"" serious journalists went to work with more determination than ever.

Sure, journalists made mistakes, and when discovered, they were promptly corrected. That stands in sharp contrast to Trump's avalanche of lies. By The New York Times' count, Trump has told nearly six times as many falsehoods in 10 months than Barack Obama told in eight years as President. Trump succeeded in confusing the public and blurring reality. It was all in keeping with his gaslighting technique . But the reality-based media fought back with facts and with in-depth reporting that brought Americans history-changing truths.

Giving satire a shot in the arm

While Trump made Americans more serious, he also made comedians much funnier. Political humor blossomed like never before. Observers noted that the President himself hardly ever laughs unless in the company of adoring crowds, with his sense of humor limited to mocks and insults.

But for professional humorists, Trump was a godsend. The bittersweet cracks propelled the ruthlessly brilliant Stephen Colbert to new levels of hilarity, and the more Trump-centered his jokes became, the higher his ratings climbed.

So, you see, it hasn't all been bad. Perhaps Vladimir Putin is right when he says Trump has made significant achievements. Although, this is probably not what Putin or what Trump has in mind when he falsely claims he has accomplished more than any of his predecessors.

It's more along the lines of Colbert's comment after Roy Moore lost the election in Alabama, when he said , ""I'm a little shaky ... due to a condition my doctor calls 'hope.'""

These are at least five achievements from the Trump administration that can give Americans that same hope.",human
Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"(CNN) President Donald Trump issued a federal emergency declaration Friday afternoon over the coronavirus outbreak following a week of cancellations, suspensions and growing case numbers that unsettled Americans nationwide.

An emergency or disaster declaration from the President frees up additional money and sets the Federal Emergency Management Agency in motion.

There are two types of declarations authorized by the Stafford Act, which is the statutory authority for "" most federal disaster response activities "": emergency declarations and major disaster declarations.

The difference between the two -- both of which unlock additional resources, like supplies and logistical help -- is scope and money.

Here's what to know about Trump's declaration:

What does a declaration do?

A declaration puts FEMA, which is supporting the Health and Human Services Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for coronavirus response, in a position to be the coordinator.

""The center of gravity switches from HHS headquarters to FEMA,"" said Daniel Kaniewski, who previously served as deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA.

More federal funds will become available, as will supplies, personnel and any other support. FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor told lawmakers Wednesday that the agency's warehouses are stocked with commodities across the country.

When activated, FEMA can help with logistics, like the transport of residents if needed, and put up temporary medical facilities. Those resources could come from across federal agencies, from stocked warehouses and through contracts. States will likely communicate what they need and where they need it.

Steve Reaves, president of the union that represents FEMA workers, said that during the California wildfires, for example, FEMA came in, put up tents, set up command and control centers, and worked with state and local governments to track casualties.

But during other health crises -- including Zika, H1N1 and SARS -- FEMA maintained a supporting role to HHS and declarations were never issued, according to Michael Coen, a senior adviser for emergency management at IEM and former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama administration.

""None of those became as big of an outbreak as we're seeing with COVID-19. But those were examples of FEMA being in support of HHS in some way, but without the use of a Stafford emergency declaration or major disaster declaration,"" he said.

Washington asked for a declaration on Thursday

Requests are generally made by the governor of an affected state. States have been scrambling to sort out what they need to respond to the increasing number of coronavirus cases before they make that request. During the week, FEMA personnel fielded questions from state staff about what support the agency -- which is within the Department of Homeland Security -- can provide to respond to the outbreak, said Reaves.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday requested that the administration declare a national emergency.

""It is incumbent on all of us to acknowledge the gravity of this public health emergency and take the necessary actions now Ã¢ÂÂ not tomorrow, not next week Ã¢ÂÂ to slow the spread of the virus and save lives,"" Inslee said in a statement Friday. ""By declaring a national emergency, the federal government can provide states with direct assistance to meet our residents' needs for health care, shelter, food and cash assistance, and more.""

Additional declarations might come later

Additional declarations might also be issued down the line, so the federal government can reimburse state and local governments for the costs incurred during an incident. For example, President Bill Clinton issued an emergency declaration in 2000 over the West Nile virus, authorizing millions of dollars in federal funds to reimburse affected local governments.

Declarations can start as one type of emergency and then change to another in order to access more resources. These declarations are separate from the national emergency Trump declared over the southern US border last year.

Why did it take so long to declare?

Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, in conjunction with Sens. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, and Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, sent a letter asking Trump to ""immediately"" consider disaster declaration requests for the coronavirus.

The reason for the delay in proceeding with a request may have been because states were still assessing their resources and the federal assistance received thus far.

""It's possible that a) the states have the resources it needs b) that the state has most of the resources it needs and the resources it doesn't have it's getting from HHS and the $8.3 billion,"" Kaniewski, who's now a managing director at Marsh & McLennan Companies.

""I think in the future if those -- and that future can be today or a week from now or it could be never -- if they require supplemental assistance beyond what they're getting from HHS, there would be an obvious time to submit an emergency declaration request.""

New Jersey told CNN on Thursday, for example, that it hadn't reached that point. ""Due to the recent release of more than $15 (million) in HHS funding that can be used for these COVID-19 costs, the State thresholds for FEMA assistance certainly have not been met yet,"" according to a statement from the governor's office Thursday.

As the crisis evolves, states will likely continue to review their needs and the role of federal assistance.",human
Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"After being asked whether she was concerned that there could be patients who don't get a ventilator -- or if ""actual physical equipment that is needed to serve the people who get sick is out there"" -- Verma told Fox News: ""And that's why the President has taken such bold and decisive action. We're not waiting for this to get worse. We're not waiting for this to be a crisis in our health care systems.""

She did not answer the question. As health officials on the President's coronavirus task force have faced tough questioning about the federal government's ability to confront the ballooning crisis, they have at times turned to praising Trump instead.

And even though flattering the boss comes with the territory in the Trump administration -- a qualification on display in his first Cabinet meeting -- it's an approach health officials are now taking in the face of a major national crisis.

One official who has received praise from both sides of the political aisle for his straightforward answers is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the President's coronavirus task force. He was one of few officials to acknowledge deficiencies in diagnostic testing and has repeatedly yet delicately corrected the President on the timeline of vaccine development.

In recent days, some lawmakers have urged the President to let Fauci be the public face of the administration's response to coronavirus. The President has praised Fauci and pointed out the doctor's place on the task force -- but some of the lawmakers hope Trump will go further and just let Fauci do the talking.

Non-administration health officials have raised concerns about persistent delays in testing that have caused an obfuscated view of how widespread the virus is in the US, and hospital administrators have advised that they do not have the supplies or room to treat the patients they're expecting.

But when Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accompanied the president to the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta last Friday, he was asked to address the press. He took the opportunity to lavish praise on the man standing next to him.

""First, I want to thank you for your decisive leadership in helping us, you know, put public health first,"" Redfield said. ""I also want to thank you for coming here today and -- and sort of encouraging and bringing energy to the men and women that you see that work every day to try to keep America safe. So, I think that's the most important thing I want to say, sir.""

Then in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, an anesthesiologist who is in his mid-40s, insisted the President was ""healthier than I am"" after being asked if Trump and other aging Democratic candidates should stop traveling given they are in a category most vulnerable to contracting coronavirus.

""Speaking of being at risk, the President, he sleeps less than I do and he's healthier than what I am,"" Adams claimed. He later walked back the remark.

In the days since Trump announced that anyone who wants a test can get a test, a bipartisan group of lawmakers have expressed frustration with the lack of availability. One Republican senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, said the President's claim was inaccurate.""

""People should stop saying if you want a test, you should get a test right now,"" Lankford said after a briefing with administration officials. ""That's not here at this point.""",human
Holi celebrated with face masks and color explosions amid coronavirus fears,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Explosions of pink and purple powder. Rainbow dust tumbling through the air. Faces, hair, hands and clothes rendered in a kaleidoscope of colors.

Not even fears about the coronavirus could stop many people from taking to the streets in India to celebrate Holi , one of the world's most photogenic religious festivals, although some donned face masks.

Others, including India's prime minister, opted to give it a miss altogether.

Usually a huge draw for tourists, Holi is traditionally celebrated across India, South Asia and among the Indian diaspora as the spring equinox approaches in the northern hemisphere. This year, it's celebrated on March 9 and 10.

With participants ranging from the old to the young, irrespective of class, the Hindu festival generally is viewed as a bringing together of the community, with swathes of people collectively taking to the streets of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other regions of India to celebrate.

Good over evil

Bright powders and water balloons are launched in the air by participants of ""the Festival of Colors"" with the aim of smearing and throwing as much gulal -- a fine powder offered in several shades -- as possible on friends and family.

Celebrated for centuries, the festival symbolizes the triumph of good over evil and commemorates new beginnings.

Over time, however, Holi has found a place in popular culture. It's now celebrated globally each year and inspires events such as ""The Color Run"" race series, and clothing design, such as Pharrell Williams and Adidas' Hu Holi shoe collaboration.

Before taking part in the fun, though, people are often advised to protect exposed skin with oil to avoid staining.",human
America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down,"(CNN) For many Americans, the past 48 hours have felt like uncharted territory.

Despite the unprecedented measures, one top US health official said the number of outbreaks is ""definitely going to get worse before it gets better.""

There's no way around it, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CNN on Thursday night. ""We will have a lot more cases.""

At least 1,740 cases have been reported across 48 states and the District of Columbia. At least 41 people have died: 31 in Washington state, which has been the epicenter of the outbreak, with at least 457 cases; four in California; two in Florida; one in Georgia; one in Kansas; one in New Jersey and one in South Dakota.

after he was in the same room last weekend as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his entourage. Bolsonaro's press secretary tested positive Thursday for coronavirus. Among the new patients reported Friday was Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who said he would go into self-quarantine after he was in the same room last weekend as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his entourage. Bolsonaro's press secretary tested positive Thursday for coronavirus.

""I feel completely healthy and strong,"" Suarez said in a statement. ""However, I am doing the responsible thing by working with the County's Health Department to take every precaution to ensure that not only my family is healthy, but everyone I have come in contact with is healthy as well.""

The number of cases across the country will likely continue jumping as more tests become available and some facilities begin conducting drive-through testing.

Gatherings are banned, schools are closed

Across many states, the bottom line: Stay home. And if you have to go out, keep your distance.

Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon became the first states to announce statewide shutdowns of all K-12 schools. Friday morning, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the San Diego Unified School District -- which together serve more than 750,000 students -- announced they would close for two weeks, beginning Monday.

""You got to try to slow this thing down early,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told CNN's John Berman on Friday.

Ohio had only five confirmed cases of the coronavirus. But ""two weeks is too late. Another week is too late,"" DeWine said he'd been told by experts.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued guidance to shut down all public and private K-12 schools in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties, the state's most populous areas, for the next six weeks.

""Today's decision has a full range of implications from learning plans and childcare, to free and reduced-price breakfast and lunch, just to name a few,"" Inslee said in a statement. ""I anticipate this will cause ripple effects ... but we can't afford not to do it.""

A day earlier, Inslee announced a ban on all events with more than 250 people in the state's largest three counties. He has also issued guidance for assisting-living facilities to limit visitors after at least 10 homes reported cases.

The announcement paralleled the one by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who directed events with 500 or more people to be canceled or postponed and announced only ""medically necessary visits"" will be allowed in nursing homes. Some experts have advised banning all visitors from skilled-nursing facilities nationwide

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he stood by Cuomo's announcement on large gatherings and called the city's rising coronavirus case numbers ""striking and troubling."" New York City had 42 new cases in a day, he said.

""We don't do any of this lightly. This is difficult,"" he said at a Thursday news conference. ""We know it has a serious, serious impact on a number of businesses ... that's really, really painful for the many, many people who work in that field.""

Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said he asked the governor to issue an executive order to postpone the state's April 4 presidential primary for two months, until June 20. He said coronavirus was ""an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced.""

Similar directives were issued by California, Oregon, New Mexico, Ohio and Utah leaders, who urged the cancellation of large public events.

In Georgia, which had its first death Thursday and has reported 42 cases, officials designated a state park with emergency mobile units as an isolation site for residents who test positive.

At least nine school districts -- including the state's three largest -- also announced closures as early as Friday and lasting up to two weeks.

Others hit the pause button

Augusta National Golf Club on Friday announced that the Masters will be postponed in response to the outbreak. The year's first major was scheduled to tee off on April 9.

It was one of many cancellations that left the public stunned.

In New York, which reported 328 positive cases, the Broadway League said it is suspending all shows through April 12 ""in support of the health and well-being of the theatre public, as well as those who work in the theatre industry.""

The NBA is suspending the rest of its season, it said Wednesday, after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus. That announcement came shortly after the NCAA announced it would ban public audiences from March Madness games -- then a day later canceled the tournaments altogether.

Some shoppers panic-buy essentials

Fearing what might come, Americans from New York to Chicago to Atlanta flocked grocery stores, emptying shelves of essentials.

One Massachusetts resident told CNN it took nearly half an hour to check out as staff members reassured shoppers via intercom that the store would stay open all weekend.

In New York City, some grocery stores had little to nothing left, a Twitter user posted.

Go to any NYC grocery store or Target, view the empty shelves and tell me again the overreaction is on Twitter only, lol. pic.twitter.com/22WQdb1Ev7 Ã¢ÂÂ BeauxAfrique (@BeauxAfrique) March 12, 2020

""Well, it's been very intense,"" Avi Kaner, co-owner of Morton Williams, a New York supermarket chain, told CNN.

The uptick in business began about 10 days ago, Kaner said. But on Thursday, there was a record-breaking 300% to 400% surge in business, he said.

Certain items, like hand sanitizer and wipes, are being rationed by some distributors, Kaner said, and they're gone within minutes of being stocked in store.

""Whenever we do get new rations in of hand sanitizer and wipes, we actually put them out by the registers, and they go within minutes,"" he said.

Shopping patterns mirrored those ""you would see as people prepare for a major storm,"" a Walmart spokesperson told CNN earlier this month

At one grocery chain in Pennsylvania, shelves were kept ""packed with products similar to when a blizzard is being called for and folks know they might be stuck at home ,"" a sales executive said.

'Shutting down most of our structures of society'

DeWine said he wants his state to ""treat this like it is -- and that is a crisis.""

The state has reported five positive cases, but Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton said it's likely that number is not even close to the real tally of infections.

""We know now, just the fact of community spread says that at least 1%... of our population is carrying the virus in Ohio today,"" Acton said Thursday in a news conference. ""We have 11.7 million people. So, the math is: over 100,000. That just gives you a sense of how this virus spreads and is spreading quickly.""

""The steps we are taking will absolutely save lives,"" she said of the governor's actions. ""We're all sort of waking up to this new reality.""

State officials will release fact sheets and checklists to help residents ""figure out what this new norm is going to be like,"" she said.

""We are basically slowly shutting down most of our structures of society,"" she said.

Drive-through testing begins

The number of US cases is likely to be much higher and will continue to climb as more Americans are tested, health officials have said.

But that process, initially conducted by the CDC, has proved faulty. The slow rollout prompted the federal government to approve private labs to conduct their own testing and has so far sent out more than a million tests. Vice President Mike Pence said 4 million more would be available by the end of the week.

The testing system currently in place is not geared to the country's needs, and ""that is a failing,"" Fauci, with the National Institutes of Health, told a congressional committee Thursday

""The idea of anybody getting it (a test) easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,"" Fauci said. ""Do I think we should be? Yes, but we're not.""

Communities in New York, Illinois and Colorado began moving toward drive-through testing.

Health care workers from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment test people for Covid-19 on Thursday in Denver at the state's first drive-up testing center.

Cuomo announced New York will have the first drive-through testing facility on the East Coast and officials will start testing people by appointment in New Rochelle, a suburb community that registered more than 100 cases in about a week and has imposed a 1-mile containment zone

""You have to make an appointment. You can't just show up,"" Cuomo told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Friday.

With the anxiety and fear surrounding the virus, the governor said, it's not feasible to test just anyone who wants to be assessed.

""We have to prioritize, because we don't have that kind of capacity,"" he said.

A suburban Illinois hospital said it also will try drive-through tests, telling residents they would drive up to an ambulance and get tested without leaving their car, CNN affiliate WGN reported.",human
An Australian man dies in alleged ax attack near school after 'road rage' incident,"(CNN) A 24-year-old man was killed by an ax-wielding group near a primary school in Australia, as parents picked up their children on Thursday, according to CNN affiliate Seven News.

The attack happened at about 6 p.m. and followed a road rage incident in the same suburb of Melbourne, Australia, which took place two hours earlier.

""Investigators have established that the fatal assault is linked to an earlier alleged road rage, assault and theft incident,"" police said in the statement.

Paramedics were called to the site of the attack, but the 24-year-old victim died at the scene on Thursday evening. Soon after, the three alleged attackers were arrested and charged with murder. Two were aged 22 and the other was 20 years old.

The Plot Against AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs vision feels eerily familiar,"Perhaps because our own times seem bleak, alternate histories are flourishing on screen, ranging from the dystopian, piercingly real HandmaidÃ¢ÂÂs Tale to the apocalyptic, mind-bending Watchmen and most recently Hunters, with cartoonish characters pursuing resurgent Nazis. All reassure us Ã¢ÂÂAt least that didnÃ¢ÂÂt happenÃ¢ÂÂ. Like The HandmaidÃ¢ÂÂs Tale, based on Margaret AtwoodÃ¢ÂÂs novel, the HBO series The Plot Against America has an impeccable literary source. Philip RothÃ¢ÂÂs 2004 novel posits that aviator Charles Lindbergh, a national hero, Nazi sympathiser and isolationist Ã¢ÂÂ all of those things historically true Ã¢ÂÂ became US president in the early 1940s, with Hitler on the rise.

More like this:

- The TV show that predicted the future

- Al PacinoÃ¢ÂÂs Nazi-hunting show is a hit

- Is this the new Big Little Lies?

The story is explosive. An ordinary, working-class Jewish family in New Jersey Ã¢ÂÂ Herman and Bess Levin, their two young sons and their relatives Ã¢ÂÂ grapple with the fallout of an anti-Semite in the White House. The showÃ¢ÂÂs high-profile creators are David Simon and Ed Burns, the team behind the classic series The Wire. And the performances are stunning, especially Zoe KazanÃ¢ÂÂs as the fearful but realistic Bess and Winona RyderÃ¢ÂÂs as her self-deluding sister, Evelyn. So why is this uneven miniseries far less compelling than it sounds on paper?

It becomes more chilling the more it departs from reality, with terrible events that are not unimaginable

Part of the problem lies with history itself. What Roth imagined as outlandish in 2004 is all too familiar now. LindberghÃ¢ÂÂs real-life isolationist slogan Ã¢ÂÂAmerica FirstÃ¢ÂÂ has been appropriated by Donald Trump. In the years since the novelÃ¢ÂÂs publication, ethnic hatred and white supremacism have been resurgent around the world. In many ways, RothÃ¢ÂÂs history doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem alternate at all.

That problem is compounded by the showÃ¢ÂÂs earnest, dutiful approach. The first three of its six episodes are not bad if you have a high tolerance for didactic kitchen-sink drama. The last three gain in intensity. The series becomes more chilling the more it departs from reality, with terrible events that are not unimaginable but still unrealised.

As the story slowly builds, Herman remains a fiery idealist, passionately and effectively played by Morgan Spector. Lindbergh is a threat to the familyÃ¢ÂÂs upwardly-mobile life and their civil rights, but Herman is determined to stand his ground. Bess wants above all to protect her family. Kazan brilliantly and sensitively makes her a woman of her time. As anti-Semitism becomes more virulent, Bess thoughtfully chooses when to argue with her husband, when to let him lead, and when itÃ¢ÂÂs time to insist that if he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt move the family out of danger and into Canada, she will. Their adolescent son, Sheldon, sees Lindbergh only as a dashing pilot, conveying the perils of celebrity hero-worship. The younger son, Philip, takes it all in, an increasingly frightened child. The brown palette of the LevinsÃ¢ÂÂs world looks perfect in its drabness, from the shabby but pristine rowhouse to BessÃ¢ÂÂs practical cotton housedresses.

The extended family comes to include Lionel Bengelsdorf, a rabbi with Confederate ancestors, who is also an outspoken Lindbergh supporter, swallowing the idea that being pro-Hitler is a justified defence against communism. Played by John Turturro with a dripping Southern accent, Bengelsdorf is a problematic, unexplored character. We never quite see why he is so gullible.

Evelyn, sophisticated and lonely, cares for her ailing mother. She eagerly becomes BengelsdorfÃ¢ÂÂs assistant and then his fiancÃÂ©e. Ryder is triumphant in a role much enhanced from the book, as she makes EvelynÃ¢ÂÂs self-delusion painfully clear. Bengelsdorf is rich, attentive, and has access to powerful people. Evelyn lets herself ignore all the political warning signs, and even enrols Sheldon in her fiancÃÂ©eÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂJust FolksÃ¢ÂÂ program, sending Jewish children for a summer in the rural US in a barely-veiled attempt to dilute their ethnicity.

The conclusion is moving and more pessimistic about the possibilities for equality in the US than Roth was

But all this powerful acting is often saddled with sledgehammer dialogue drawing parallels to today. When swastikas are drawn on headstones at a Jewish cemetery, HermanÃ¢ÂÂs brother Monty (David Krumholtz) blames the president. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂve always been here,Ã¢ÂÂ he says of the bigots, Ã¢ÂÂbut now itÃ¢ÂÂs like they have permission to crawl out from under a rockÃ¢ÂÂ. Similar lines have echoed through real life in the past few years. When Monty comes to tolerate Lindbergh, Herman is outraged. Ã¢ÂÂStock market is up, profits are up,Ã¢ÂÂ he yells. Ã¢ÂÂEverything else about Lindbergh, what he stands for, is forgotten!Ã¢ÂÂ That dialogue might as well be a giant finger pointing toward Trump. The line resonated more pointedly before the recent market collapse, of course. Even alternate histories have trouble keeping up.

Some scenes in the final episodes make it worth slogging through the early ones. Kazan is heartbreaking as she tries to calm a small boy on the phone, and fierce when she confronts her sister. When Lindbergh invites HitlerÃ¢ÂÂs Foreign Minister, Von Ribbentrop, to a White House dinner, Lionel and Evelyn are guests, giving cover to the idea that the president canÃ¢ÂÂt be anti-Semitic if he has invited a rabbi. Evelyn, blithely smiling, dances with Von Ribbentrop, her head so turned by the glamour that nothing else matters. At dinner Lionel quietly pushes aside the shrimp on his plate, and makes excuses when Lindbergh rudely snubs him. Here, finally, are dramatised scenes that are terrifying and eye-opening because they are so personal and specific. In those too-few moments, the series doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to tell us what to think.

The conclusion is moving and more pessimistic about the possibilities for equality in the US than Roth was. Yet even that sobering ending doesnÃ¢ÂÂt escape the tone of a classroom lecture. The Plot Against America has high, half-realised ambitions. Preaching to its audience didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to be one of them.

90% of people are biased against women. That's the challenge we face,"Padma Lakshmi is a United Nations Development Programme goodwill ambassador, TV host and New York Times best-selling author. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) I grew up the child of a single mother in New York, and at home, of course, a woman made all the decisions -- there was no one else. But my mother's autonomy was hard-earned. She fled to the United States after leaving an abusive marriage because in our native India, the stigma of divorce would have made a normal life impossible.

We moved across the world to evade constricting gender norms.

Padma Lakshmi

Of course, we found that women in the United States, too, struggled against the limitations of their prescribed roles. But in my childhood in the '70s and '80s in the shadow of Second Wave feminism, there was an assumption that as the laws changed to allow women more public participation, social norms would evolve too.

Many didn't. In the United States and other countries, attitudes about gender roles have proved remarkably persistent. A new United Nations Development Programme index on social norms related to gender suggests that bias forms the glass ceiling that blocks women's advancement in all aspects of their lives.

Almost 90% of the world's men, and women, are biased in some way against women, according to the Gender Social Norms Index. Half of men and women feel that men make better political leaders. More than 56% feel that men have more right to a job and/or make better business executives.

Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response,"Dr. Tom Frieden is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and former commissioner of the New York City Health Department.

(CNN) The novel coronavirus is an unprecedented threat. We don't know how bad it will be or for how long it will spread, but we do know that it has already infected more than 118,000 people around the world -- and probably many times that number, killed more than 4,000 people and caused serious global economic damage. We need to adapt our responses to different countries and different parts of the same country in order to limit damage. Using data well is essential to an effective response.

A business that markets a product that no one buys stops making it. If lots of people buy, you make more. Government doesn't have sales figures to go by; public decisions have to be based on other data.

We lack crucial information about the new virus. Here are three areas where we need more data (additional important knowledge gaps here ):

How is the virus spreading? How much do asymptomatic cases spread disease? Are contaminated surfaces important sources of spread?

How deadly is the virus? Reported fatality rates likely overestimate death rates because there are many undiagnosed cases.

What works to limit spread? For example, since children don't appear to get ill, even if infected, they may not be important sources of infection -- so school closures may have limited value.

We learn more every day. We will be able to reduce infections, save lives, and limit damage to society if we rapidly collect, analyze and use data.",human

What the 'Friends' reunion makes me hope for,"Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She tweets @HolstaT . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Last week, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc and Matthew Perry took to their Instagram feeds to confirm the long-held suspicions of fans around the world: the ""Friends"" gang is getting back together for a reunion.

We don't know what form the show will take. But it puts a renewed and 21st century spotlight on the 1990s favorite -- which for many, defined a generation, and has for years after its run ended enjoyed enduring popularity in syndication and on Netflix . As even devoted fans can recognize now, ""Friends"" often ended up on the wrong side of cultural history, highlighting many troubling norms of its time. This reunion on HBO Max is a timely opportunity for fans and new observers to ponder exactly why many people still love this show, and to ask what the hopefully older, wiser group of ""Friends"" might potentially acknowledge on the Central Perk sofa, this time around. (Like CNN, HBO Max -- a streaming service set to launch in May -- is owned by Warner Media.)

For starters, the ""Friends"" reunion might take a stab at talking about the original show's glaring lack of diversity. While there were equivalent non-white sitcoms in the 1990s, it was a gigantic oversight for arguably the decade's biggest program -- set in one of the biggest, most diverse cities in the world -- to have such poor representation of anyone not straight, white, middle-class and thin.

David Schwimmer noted in a recent interview his awareness of the show's lack of diversity, suggesting there should be an ""all-black 'Friends' or an all-Asian 'Friends'."" Erika Alexander, a cast member of the show ""Living Single,"" which also portrayed a group of young single city-dwelling friends and debuted a year before ""Friends"" took to Twitter to point out what appeared to be a glaring assumption that such a show hadn't already existed. Schwimmer replied in a tweet: ""I didn't mean to imply Living Single hadn't existed or indeed hadn't come before Friends, which I knew it had.""

Compared to shows like ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"" which handled not only racial politics, but issues like generational and class divides with humor and elegance, ""Friends"" remained pretty static in its cozy middle-class bubble. Any point of difference was used as a kooky reference -- ""Phoebe used to be homeless, so she's super tough!"" -- rather than an opportunity to explore a potentially juicy theme or raise viewers' social consciousness.

Issues which shouldn't have been issues -- like Monica's childhood fatness -- were used for cheap, offensive laughs. Plump, clumsy, naive adolescent Monica (shown through frequent flashback scenes over the years) wasn't even allowed to have the same personality as thin, efficient, sharp Monica -- she was just a ""fun"" extra character who sometimes just showed up.

On the rare occasions someone who didn't fit the mold appeared on ""Friends,"" they were used as a foil for the main, L'Oreal-ready cast's experience. Take the treatment of Chandler's -- apparently, but not explicitly -- transgender dad, played by Kathleen Turner. Their identity wasn't ever addressed head-on in the show, but the general impression is that it's confusing, and therefore traumatic for Chandler. Their presentation is used as fodder for grim lines like, ""Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?"" It'd be cool to see that relationship discussed. For instance, Turner has said that she wouldn't accept the same role now.

Of course, there are other LGBTQ concerns the gang could talk about. One of the show's longest-running jokes -- introduced within the first few minutes of the 1994 pilot -- is that Ross was dumped by his first wife, Carol, for another woman, Susan. While it was unusual in the 1990s to feature a gay female couple on TV, and particularly groundbreaking for its time to feature them as parents, that visibility is undermined by the main joke being that it's embarrassing for Ross to have been dumped for another woman. From Ross's first meeting with her , Carol's girlfriend Susan is painted as an unreasonable baddie, and the pattern of gay-is-a-punchline is set up for many seasons thereafter. The Susan of 2020 would deserve to be portrayed now as a total hero for putting up with it all.

""Friends"" was hardly the only show of the era which failed to take gay female relationships seriously. When ""Sex and the City""'s Samantha started dating a woman in the show's fourth season, her friends' responses are initially snide and disrespectful. Her friend Charlotte remarks: ""Maybe she [Samantha] just ran out of men?"" It's used as just another instance in which Samantha is judged for her sexual proclivity by her supposedly enlightened pals.

The slut-shaming mentality of the 1990s also occasionally emerged on ""Friends."" One of the early sticking points of Richard and Monica's relationship is how many sexual partners Monica has had. When Monica reveals the number, Richard -- a friend of Monica's dad and portrayed by Tom Selleck -- sits down, breathing a relieved sigh: ""You had me thinking it was like, a fleet."" The strong implication is that had the number been higher, that would have been a problem. It's a weird point to focus on, considering Richard dating Monica, whom he has known since she was a baby, is the equivalent of Joey, in 2020, dating Ross and Rachel's daughter Emma.

You have to hope that if dating comes up among the ""Friends"" of 2020, they might at least advocate for doing a few things differently in retrospect -- and indeed, all sexual interactions. Joey's womanizing, Ross's history as a controlling, jealous boyfriend, and Chandler's cruel treatment of his girlfriend Janice, are well-documented. But some early events outside the main cast are more sinister. In season one, when Rachel's boyfriend Paolo gropes Phoebe while she's giving him a professional massage, the gang treats the incident as a form of cheating. Phoebe even apologizes to Rachel for the fact that Paolo ""made a move"" on her. Post #MeToo, that ""dramatic twist"" reads very differently.

Considering how little the show commented on the part where touching women without consent is actual assault, it stands out even more today how hyper-sensitive the gang were to entirely benign events involving women's bodies or parenting. When Carol breastfeeds her son, Ben, early on in ""Friends,"" Joey and Chandler make their horrified escape as soon as possible. This wasn't just a male thing on 1990s sitcoms, apparently; Carrie on ""Sex And the City"" legs it when she sees her friend Miranda feed her new baby. By contrast, actual problematic parenting -- see Ross hating on his son Ben's Barbie, and firing the male nanny for being ""too sensitive"" -- is seen as kind of cute. Less than two decades ago, men got credit just for being in the same room as their offspring.

So what might HBO Max's upcoming special have in store? You've gotta hope that by 2020, the gang has some perspective on the internalized -- and externalized -- misogyny of their show's youth. At the very least, they likely have a better understanding of the world beyond Central Perk, where objectifying women is bad, and ignoring stale gender binaries is good. Failing that, the best thing the ""Friends"" cast can do for themselves is probably ... make other friends.",human
Together we make a family,"This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, "" What it's like to be me ,"" which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn't ask me. He didn't even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, ""While you're down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?""

At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: ""No!""

As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren't seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.

The delivery room wasn't my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn't always perfect for me growing up. My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, ""Kids like you don't go here, you go to the special school."" If it weren't for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.

I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be ""different"" in a way that he is not.

When he comes, I'll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I've always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.

With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist -- who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn't ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business. I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation -- which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.

I don't know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I've asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.

While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it's also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.

Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act is that it's easier for people with disabilities to become parents. It's natural to assume that once people with disabilities have remedies for discrimination and greater access to society, they'll do exactly what a lot of nondisabled people do: get married and have kids. This was always a logical conclusion to me, as both my parents were little people (which is rare -- 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it).

Growing up with a disability

My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world , affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.

My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.

I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor's and master's degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.

I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith's latest film, ""Dogma,"" and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.

It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm -- and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.

All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the ""gay cancer,"" my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.

I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, ""We're here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They're no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we'd hope they would be here for us.""

And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.

'Mom, I think I want to be a clown'

When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. ""Mom, I think I want to be clown."" She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. ""What?"" she asked.

""Yeah, I think I want to be a clown."" We rode home in silence. I didn't realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.

I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.

Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller , an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read ""for fun.""

My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.

Taking this path was important to me -- and to my family as well.

Rebecca Cokley with her mom.

When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school. It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn't have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having ""midget midget"" shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.

Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.

My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos , the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job -- at Victoria's Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.

You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, ""You have to make someone want something they don't need and want to pay too much for it.""

My boss at Victoria's Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I'd have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.

I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They'd actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. ""Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit."" (We all wore black suits). ""Well, she's petite."" (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.

The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were ""fascinated"" with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, ""We could pick you up and walk out with you. We'd take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us."" I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened ""spidey sense"" because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.

Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth . I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away -- cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by ""staring at the new girl."" I have no memory of this.

Building a family

Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.

Patrick is average height and African-American. I'm a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I'm the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he's the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.

Rebbeca Hare and Patrick Cokley were married at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Columbia.

When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that's how those of us in the community refer to ""little people"") friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn't ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height -- they'd ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn't care either way.

I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama's White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, ""I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules."" And those are really the values that we stress as we're raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.

At age 6, Jackson's awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, ""Mom, you're white, Dad's black, and I'm peach."" His dad turned around and said ""Peach? You're black."" Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said ""Peach!"" This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.

We've purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It's important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.

Since we're raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband's childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can't -- and in some cases, shouldn't -- be the one to answer.

As a professional advocate, I've spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police -- Eric Garner , Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland -- were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.

Rebecca Cokley and President Obama pose for a snapshot.

Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now -- their curiosity, their feeling that they've never met a stranger, their trust in the world -- could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.

My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn't keep it from him.

Parenthood and activism: our forms of protest in the world

When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn't be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well . Whether it's forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the ""well-meaning"" nondisabled public for centuries.

No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.

Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent's disability. In my work as an advocate, I've spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.

If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language. Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like ""special needs,"" ""differently abled,"" or, in a pun on language from the past, ""handi-capable.""

These aren't words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with -- they were defined by society because the concept of ""disability"" makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It's a reminder that yes, we are different.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley and their kids in their Washington neighborhood.

But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that ""disability"" is something to be ashamed of -- say, by implying that someone shouldn't have more children because of one -- society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights. We didn't celebrate the 27th anniversary of the ""Americans with Special Needs Act"" this summer, after all.

The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT -- with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police -- and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.

They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live -- in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims

We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It's impossible not to -- and we would be irresponsible if we didn't.

We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don't have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women's march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn't I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, ""I am the mommy,"" but not a single one apologized to me.

As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don't know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don't care either way.

What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

"Son accused of stabbing mother to death, man shot and killed in back-to-back Tacoma homicides","TACOMA Ã¢ÂÂ A Tacoma man is charged with stabbing his mother to death and a man was shot and killed in two separate homicides over a 24-hour period.

According to Tacoma Police, officers responded about 3:45 p.m. Tuesday to a disturbance at an apartment in the 1800 block of South 82nd Street. When they arrived, they found a 61-year-old woman dead. She has since been identified as Sarann Suong, according to court documents.

Her 30-year-old son, Larry Suong, has been charged with first-degree murder and pleaded not guilty to her death. HeÃ¢ÂÂs in jail on a $1 million bond.

Police said Sarann Suong had just walked in her front door when her son attacked her, stabbing her multiple times in her face, head and neck.

According to court documents, her son said he stabbed her because he was not going to allow her to yell at him on that particular day. Neighbors told The News-Tribune that Sarann was a nice woman, but her son often caused trouble around the complex.

About 24 hours later on Wednesday, March 11, an officer was flagged down in the 700 block of South 16th Street by a passerby who reported a fight in a nearby alley. The officer went to the alley in the 1500 block of South Yakima Avenue and found a 32-year-old man with a gunshot wound to his leg.

He was taken to a hospital and later died of his injures.

As of Thursday, police had not identified any suspects.",human

(CNN) For just a moment Wednesday night you might have thought President Donald Trump was at long last grasping the gravity of the coronavirus situation and taking the necessary steps to confront what may be the most serious crisis the country has faced since he took office -- one that could lead to the deaths of vast numbers of people.

Trump tried to give a serious address to the nation from the Oval Office, laying out a plan to tackle the pandemic. But it quickly became apparent that this was one more error-filled display in what has been a grotesque carnival of incompetence.

The Europe travel and cargo ban started making headlines around the world while the President was still on the air. Anxious families wondered how they'd get traveling children home. Importers were in shock.

But just moments after the speech ended, the Department of Homeland Security issued a "" clarification ."" Turns out Trump got much of it wrong , even though he was reading from a teleprompter.

DHS said the restriction would not apply to Americans or US residents and their families, and would cover only foreigners who over the past 14 days spent time in certain European countries. It doesn't cover cargo. In short, it's nothing like Trump's dramatic announcement. Instead, it's a partial ban on flights from the area known as Schengen, a 26-country European travel bloc. The White House issued the proclamation , confirming DHS's version. There was also no mention of 30 days.

It gets worse. Trump also announced what would have been a milestone in fighting the fast-spreading contagion. Leaders of the health insurance industry, he said, ""have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments."" That would have broken through one of the most dangerous obstacles to containment, allowing more Americans to seek the care they need without fear of bankruptcy. But that too was wrong.

The insurance industry corrected him, saying they have agreed to waive co-payments "" for testing, not for treatment ,"" a colossal difference from what Trump indicated.

How is it possible that the President of the United States gets so much wrong about something so important in a speech from the Oval Office? We don't know if his speechwriters got it wrong or if he somehow improvised. Either way, it's disastrous and unacceptable.

The frontrunner in the Democratic primary, former Vice President Joe Biden, by contrast, modeled a statesmanlike approach in remarks on Thursday, when he offered his own plans for addressing the virus and its associated economic perils. Taking aim at Trump's words from the night before, Biden urged Americans not to ""panic or fall back on xenophobia""; ""labeling Covid-19 a 'foreign virus' does not displace accountability for the misjudgments thus far"" of the Trump administration, Biden said.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has magnified the danger of everything we have seen from this president from the day he took office.

From the start of the epidemic, Trump did nothing but ignore, minimize and mislead the public, while draping himself in cringeworthy, unctuous praise from officials who diminished themselves to avoid upsetting him, after seeing how those who spoke the truth incurred his wrath.

When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Nancy Messonnier warned that the virus would inevitably spread and we should prepare, Trump was reportedly furious according to the Washington Post.

Trump called the response and news coverage about the gravity of the virus a "" hoax ,"" and his enablers at Fox News and elsewhere irresponsibly followed suit

When the US had two dozen cases and experts said more would come, he contradicted them, saying it was not inevitable

As the number of cases and deaths grew exponentially at home and abroad -- Italy has gone from three cases three weeks ago to more than 12,000 now -- Trump incessantly tweeted and repeatedly declared that the seasonal flu kills thousands, and we don't make such a fuss.

He kept that line in what was a downright bizarre press conference at CDC headquarters last week. ""The [virus] tests are all perfect,"" he gushed, adding outlandishly ""like the letter was perfect,"" a reference to his Ukraine impeachment case. ""It's all performing perfectly, now it's performing perfectly in all places. And how was the show last night? Did it get good ratings?"" He had been on Fox the night before. Amid the random topics, he managed to include multiple falsehoods about the virus, adding to the confusion in the official message to the public.

A reporter who was there said he found Trump's statements "" terrifying .""

The most troubling statement , in my view, came when he was asked whether people on a cruise ship should be brought ashore. ""I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship."" That adds to concerns about why the US is not testing more people, a concern made worse by Trump's Tuesday address, when he boasted that US numbers are better than Europe's. (Few US tests are the likely reason.)

It apparently took a collapse in stock prices to persuade the president that this is not a public relations and marketing problem that can be solved with ""alternative facts."" So, he wore his stern face to the Oval Office and addressed the nation.

America's European allies were not only baffled by what they heard, they were livid . In a rare statement criticizing the US, they strongly condemned Trump's decision, which many viewed as motivated by politics rather than science. ""The coronavirus is a global crisis,"" they said, ""it requires cooperation, rather than unilateral action."" Contrary to what Trump indicated in the speech, they said the travel ban was ""taken unilaterally and without consultation.""

This is but a small sliver of the mistakes and misguided moves by the President and an administration where the principal requirement for a top job is obsequious loyalty to the President.

On the whole, the Trump administration has been incompetent and ineffectual. According to Ashish Jha, head of Harvard's Global Health Institute, ""Our response is much, much worse than almost any other country that has been affected.""

The number of infections and deaths will continue climbing, and the top man in the government has undercut the efforts of the professionals and insulted US allies, showing himself incapable of handling the crisis. With the virus raging, countless lives will be lost. The President's inattention arguably delayed a stronger response, and his misrepresentations, self-serving messages, and incompetent actions have only added to the problem. It's time for Trump to stand aside and let qualified professionals do their jobs.",human
"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","A public hospital nurse, for example, would likely not be able to stay home from work even if her child was home from school. And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

Ã¢ÂÂThe downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the CouncilÃ¢ÂÂs health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving Ã¢ÂÂreports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,Ã¢ÂÂ said ScarsdaleÃ¢ÂÂs school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday. Ã¢ÂÂPreventative measures are only effective if we embrace and implement them as a community.Ã¢ÂÂ

Most public schools across the state remain open, with some major exceptions, including public schools in Scarsdale, East Ramapo, and New Rochelle in Westchester County, which is the epicenter of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs outbreak. Initially, only three New Rochelle public schools located in a one-mile Ã¢ÂÂcontainmentÃ¢ÂÂ zone closed earlier this week, but the entire district shut down on Friday following protests from families.

Inside New York CityÃ¢ÂÂs schools this week, educators were concerned and conflicted.

Ã¢ÂÂThankfully, itÃ¢ÂÂs not my decision,Ã¢ÂÂ said Liat Olenick, a teacher at the Brooklyn Arbor School in Williamsburg, of closure. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a really hard one.Ã¢ÂÂ",human
My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"Sister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of "" Dead Man Walking ."" The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.

As I was writing ""The Death of Innocents,"" I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was ""taking him on"" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, ""And I'll be right back at ya!""

In ""Innocents,"" I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the ""machinery of death.""

In grasping the ""meaning"" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.

One thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his ""originalist"" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.

After all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal ""experts,"" every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?

I have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.

As for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.

Given what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.

In 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.

I say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in""The Death of Innocents,"" taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.

Three years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments.""

In his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of ""idiot"" as ""such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is."" According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's ""idiot"" test.

My second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.

These stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by ""modern trends,"" as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.

Thus, Scalia could not brook American bishops' increasing opposition to the death penalty, nor the opposition of Popes John Paul II and Francis -- especially Pope Francis, who must have disturbed the justice considerably in his bold appeal before Congress for global abolition of the death penalty.

-- ""It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States.""

-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, ""The powers that be are ordained of God,"" to mean: ""Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy.""

Democracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.

Where was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking ""an eye for an eye,"" to pray for and forgive our enemies?

In Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.

In this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem ""enemy.""

It seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.

I also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom ""equal justice under law"" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.",human
How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution,"New York (CNN Business) Silicon Valley, its visionaries like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and the entire tech revolution may not have happened without the Cold War space race.

President John F. Kennedy's iconic 1962 speech, directing the United States to put boots on the moon within the decade, set in motion a leap in innovation. In just seven years, America went from lagging the Soviet Union in space technology to planting a flag on the lunar surface.

The Apollo program was the birthplace of the modern tech ecosystem, says Basil Hero, a former investigative reporter and media executive who authored the new book "" The Mission of a Lifetime .""

""Without [Apollo], I don't think the computer revolution would have happened as quickly and on the same trajectory,"" Hero told CNN Business. ""It would have taken an extra 10 or 20 years.""

Apollo, the startup

NASA's Apollo program was the first-ever ""moonshot."" And the ingredients that led to its success were a whatever-it-takes attitude, loose management structures, and deep funding.

Kennedy estimated early on that the first moon landing would cost about $7 billion to $9 billion. But the first thing James E. Webb did when he became NASA's administrator in 1961 was tell Kennedy to double that amount. It was a move ""any venture capitalist who has funded a high-tech startup would understand,"" Hero writes in ""The Mission of a Lifetime.""

The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is insisting they can launch their companies on the cheap, Hero said. They can end up low-balling their way out of business.

Congress was the Apollo program's financial backer, writing big checks year after year. Lawmakers even authorized NASA in 1962 to offer ""supergrade"" salaries so that the space agency could afford to hire the best and brightest, Hero notes in his book.

But, NASA could not lumber along as a bureaucratic regime if it wanted to blast humans to the moon in less than 10 years.

Enter George Mueller . He left a prestigious career at research groups such as Bell Labs to lead NASA's human spaceflight program in 1963. The space agency's history office describes him as ""a no-nonsense, forward-thinking leader"" who ""introduced a remarkable series of management changes.""

Mueller created a ""flat organization"" structure: He cut out middle management and ""made sure that the engineers on the front line were able to get their concerns straight up to the top people of NASA,"" Hero said. If safety concerns were raised or an idea just wasn't working out, decision makers listened and quickly shifted course.

""They really did trust people in the lower levels, and the engineers benefited from that,"" Hero said.

Today, California's hive of startups and tech giants, from Facebook to Google , still swear by the same management technique.

Netflix NFLX ""Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them,"" notes in its widely influential workplace culture manifesto. ""We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix Ã¢ÂÂ giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions.""

Apollo managers also had no problem bringing in young visionaries to take on unprecedented tasks, a move emulated by Silicon Valley and its obsession with young minds thinking outside the box.

Mission Control in Houston, Texas, for example, was an operation that had no precursor, and no one knew how to run it. So its manager, Christopher Kraft, brought in a bunch of ambitious 20-somethings. The average age of Mission Control employees during the Apollo 11 moon landing was just 26, Hero notes.

Making more moonshots

In terms of computing power, a modern cellphone could outdo the entire Apollo spacecraft, physicist Michio Kaku wrote in a 2011 book

The digital revolution that followed Apollo was no accident. Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs built off computing technology that NASA incubated during the Apollo era, Hero said.

Some of the tech titans that dominate today's headlines credit NASA and Apollo as a source of inspiration, and a few have Apollo-like ambitions of their own.

(CNN) As the coronavirus continues to spread and the number of infected individuals surpasses 100,000 , President Donald Trump and his allies are doing their best to convince Americans that it's not a major cause for concern and may actually have some benefits for the American economy.

Last Wednesday, Trump told Fox News viewers he had a ""hunch"" that WHO estimates on the virus's mortality rate were wrong and that many Americans infected with the virus could continue to go to work. Trump surrogate Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida emphasized the ""hilarity"" of the virus by wearing a gas mask during the House vote on funding to fight the virus.

Days after his gas mask stunt, Florida officials announced that the coronavirus had killed one of Gaetz's constituents. And Monday afternoon, Gaetz announced he was self-quarantining after being informed a person he had contact with during last week's CPAC conference had since tested positive for coronavirus. He had spent the weekend with Trump at his resort in Florida.

But by far the most prevalent party line among those seeking to distract from the Trump administration's early bungling of their response to the coronavirus has been reassuring the public that the virus really ""only"" severely impacts chronically ill or elderly Americans, so the average American shouldn't worry

In case the President and his allies have forgotten, let me remind you: elderly and chronically ill Americans are still, well, Americans. Our lives matter every bit as much as those of our healthy neighbors. And in a nation where, according to the CDC, six in 10 American adults live with at least one chronic disease, the potential impact of a highly communicable virus is much larger than one man's reelection chances. Government officials have an obligation to not only implement policies that keep Americans as a whole safe in the face of potential pandemics but also take every step necessary to make sure that disabled and chronically ill people are shielded from the harm those policies might cause them.

Thus far, Trump and his coronavirus ""task force"" seem largely focused on staging PR events designed to limit the President's political exposure. Trump appeared confused about the differences between vaccines (which would help prevent the spread of the virus) and therapeutic medications (whose purpose is to treat those infected with the virus) during last Monday's bizarre roundtable event with pharmaceutical executives, for example, which only highlighted just how little he understands about the situation.

But elected officials in Washington should be focused on taking steps to proactively limit the very real harm that could come to disabled and chronically ill Americans -- who the Trump administration has acknowledged are most at risk -- as the coronavirus continues to spread.

Congress has primarily focused on funding for the coronavirus response, passing an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill, which Trump signed into law Friday morning. The bipartisan bill, which was more than three times the size of the Trump administration's initial request, is certainly a critical part of the coronavirus response by federal, state and local health officials. But the funding bill does little to address the specific risks that chronically ill Americans face in the event of the coronavirus spreading.

Those risks are not limited to the coronavirus itself. In fact, some of the preventative measures the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued could inadvertently harm America's most medically fragile citizens unless steps are taken immediately to mitigate those dangers.

Chief among them is the impact of social distancing -- which includes avoiding large gatherings or public transportation, for example, in an effort to slow the spread of contagious diseases.

If the United States health care system becomes overwhelmed with coronavirus cases and social distancing measures are implemented, millions of chronically ill Americans who rely on one or more prescription medications need access to an emergency stockpile. The CDC's guidance for normal preparedness recommends Americans ""keep at least a 7 to 10-day supply of prescription medications,"" although some health care professionals are currently recommending patients obtain a 30-day supply whenever possible.

This represents a huge problem. Most payers (including Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance companies) have restrictions on how often they will cover the cost of refilling a member's prescription medications, often limiting patients to 30-day supplies with a short two- to three-day window for refills prior to a medication running out. These payers will most likely cover the cost of an emergency supply of medications only if forced to do so by law -- a law that Congress can and should take immediate steps to implement.

Further complicating things, millions of Americans (myself included) rely on controlled substances to manage chronic pain and other health conditions such as anxiety and ADHD. Due to increasingly restrictive state and federal laws on Schedule II, III and IV drugs in America -- including opioid pain medications and those meant for the treatment of anxiety disorders -- obtaining these medications frequently requires monthly doctor visits and urinalysis tests, and the medications often cannot be purchased in advance at all. Not only are these medications crucial for maintaining basic quality of life for millions of Americans, many of them also carry the potential for severe withdrawal symptoms that are worsened by a patient stopping the medication cold turkey, putting patients at severe risk in the event of social distancing measures preventing their refills.

Even if strict social distancing measures are not implemented in America, requiring chronically ill patients -- who are often immunocompromised -- to physically visit their doctors' office to obtain their monthly prescriptions while the coronavirus is still active in America puts those patients at higher risk of coming into contact with an infected person, increasing the chances of the virus continuing to spread and putting all of us at higher risk.

Under the Public Health Service Act, some of these issues could be addressed under the authority of the secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. In January, Azar declared a public health emergency nationwide in regard to the coronavirus. Under this declaration, Azar has the authority to waive many of the restrictions and requirements relating to the dispensing of prescription medications.

But his authority as it relates to private health insurance companies is limited. Even if Azar waived the restrictions and requirements on dispensing opioids, the issue of how millions of Americans who rely on private health insurance would cover the cost would be left to Congress to solve. And given the Trump administration's focus on increasing restrictions surrounding opioids -- and Trump's frequently stated desire to make drug laws even harsher -- it is unlikely that Azar would exercise this right.

In the meantime, it's clear that Americans cannot afford to wait around for the Trump administration to take action. Congress must move to pass legislation that allows for the adjustment of prescription medication laws in the event of an emergency such as the coronavirus. If social distancing begins to be implemented, it is critical that the government allow patients to obtain a 30-day emergency reserve supply of their prescription medications, temporarily waive requirements for patients to attend in-person doctor visits and urinalysis tests, and require that both government and private health care payers cover the cost of a small emergency supply of all prescription medications.",human
South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation,"(CNN) South Africans in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, have expressed frustration about their government's lack of evacuation plans from the city.

Nearly 60 million people are under partial or full lockdowns in cities in China as the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread across Asia and the rest of the world . At least 170 people are dead, and more than 7,700 cases have been confirmed in mainland China since the outbreak began in December.

Several countries, including the US and Japan, have flown hundreds of their citizens out of the city.

South African Pieter Viljoen, who traveled with a colleague to Wuhan for a business conference before the city's transport lockdown began, said the authorities in South Africa and its embassy in Beijing have not provided support or information about plans to repatriate them.

South Africa's embassy in Beijing also declined to help when his company made private arrangements to secure a flight to get them out of the country and requested assistance and documentation to begin their evacuation process, he says.

Viljoen said dozens of South Africans caught in the city's lockdown have also complained about the South African government's lack of communication in a WeChat group created to share information about the situation.

""We are not getting any real assistance. The only information from the South African embassy is that we must comply with local authorities. In terms of leaving Wuhan, there has been no effort or communication about evacuation,"" Viljoen said.

Viljoen said he has remained in his hotel, which has shut down operations partially since the movement restriction put in place to help check the spread of the deadly virus.

Supermarkets and grocery stores around his hotel in Wuhan's Optics Valley area are running out of supplies, he said.

""You have only these small supermarkets where you can get food right now because of the complete lockdown. You can't move around from one district to another, so supplies are not readily available,"" Viljoen told CNN on telephone.

South Africa's embassy in Beijing declined to comment on Viljoen's allegations and directed CNN's request for comment to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO).

The embassy had closed on January 26 for the Lunar New Year holiday and full operations only resumed Thursday, according to DIRCO . Emergency contact numbers manned by embassy staff were available for citizens in need of assistance to call during the holiday, the department added.

DIRCO spokesman Clayson Monyela told CNN on Thursday that the South African government and its health ministry was working on all requests. However, they must also consider travel and quarantine measures imposed by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of the virus.

""We are not ignoring their plight, and we are quite aware of the need for speed to assist our citizens in Wuhan. We are liaising with the mission in Beijing to see how we can respond to the situation within the present context,"" Monyela said.

South Africa's opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which said it was in touch with more than 100 South Africans in China, called on the foreign ministry to address the ""dysfunction"" at the county's embassy in China, which it said had affected efforts to help stranded citizens.

""The Department needs to ensure that its mission is able to communicate and allay fears by providing clear and helpful communication and assistance at the same standard of other countries that have heeded the call,"" it said in a statement Wednesday.

Uncertain future

Despite growing calls for repatriation, South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday said there were no plans to fly its citizens out as Chinese authorities have the outbreak under control.

""The Chinese government has assured us that there is no evidence to necessitate the evacuation of foreign nationals living in Wuhan city, and they have called for calm in this respect,"" Mkhize said.

He added that they have been assured by the Chinese government that foreign nationals who fall sick will be treated in the same way as Chinese citizens.

South African Jessika Bailing says she feels neglected by her country's government.

The 23-year-old English teacher, who moved from South Africa to Wuhan last year, said while many countries are racing to get their citizens out of the city, authorities in South Africa were reluctant to make such arrangements.

""I've watched other countries' governments go above and beyond to evacuate their citizens and then we are faced with that kind of response from our government, how can one not feel abandoned?"" Bailing said.

""The South African government may be putting things into place or trying to find some solutions to get the South Africans in Wuhan evacuated but neither me nor any other South African I have been in contact with feels that they are,"" she added.

Dustin Emslie says he's disappointed by the South African government's response to the situation.

""I didn't really expect the government to evacuate us, I just hoped there would be more concern for South African citizens abroad,"" he said.

Emslie, who has lived in Wuhan for six years, said he would leave with his Chinese wife and 3-year-old daughter, only if the whole family will go.

""If I had to leave, it would only be if they could come with me to South Africa. There is no way I'm just going to abandon them here,"" he said.

He says while locals and expatriates have been trying to cope with the restrictions. The uncertainty about when the lockdown will end has been the hardest to bear.

""We have no idea when this epidemic will end. It could be months that we are under lockdown here in Wuhan,"" he wrote in a text message.

#KenyansinWuhan

Many Kenyans trapped in Wuhan have also taken to social media under the hashtag #KenyansinWuhan asking their government to evacuate them from the city.

A Kenyan student at the Wuhan University of Technology, who wanted to stay anonymous due to his status as a foreign student, said he now fears for his safety as the coronavirus death toll continues to rise.

""Imagine not being able to open the door to a friend because you don't know if they are infected; it is freaking me out,"" he said.

He also said that buses, taxis, and ride-hailing apps were not working, and the only way to get around was on foot or by bicycle.

Antony Waigwa, a Kenyan student at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan told CNN that Chinese authorities have been providing free food and electricity for many students at the institute since the lockdown.

State-owned telecoms company China Unicom has also given access to free internet services so that students can communicate and inform authorities about any development while the movement restriction lasts.

""Insurance companies have also removed limits to our cover so we can get treated till we fully recover if we contract the disease,"" Waigwa told CNN.

In a statement sent to its citizens living in China on Tuesday, the Kenyan embassy in Beijing said that the Chinese authorities had assured foreign governments not to panic and evacuation was not necessary at this stage.

The repatriation process could also take two weeks as Chinese authorities will only facilitate evacuation when foreign nationals have met all quarantine processes, including 14 days of no contact with the virus, the statement said.

It added that though the coronavirus outbreak is ""severe"", the embassy was confident in the Chinese government's efforts to contain it.

The spread of the virus has prompted some airlines to cancel flights to China , and several countries have placed people traveling from Wuhan under quarantine.

The Ivory Coast put a student who had returned from Beijing with coronavirus symptoms under observation on Saturday pending her test results.

The Nigerian government on Thursday said it will begin screening Chinese nationals traveling to the West African nation for the virus. Ethiopia and Kenya have placed passengers returning from areas hit by the virus under isolation. The World Health Organization on Tuesday said there had been no confirmed cases on the continent.",human
Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin vowed on Friday that the United States government would do whatever was necessary to ensure that markets have Ã¢ÂÂalmost unlimitedÃ¢ÂÂ liquidity. He said that the economic relief package being negotiated with Congress was just the beginning of efforts to stimulate the economy in the wake of the coronavirus.

Ã¢ÂÂI think weÃ¢ÂÂre like in the second inning of getting things done,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC.

The Trump administration is considering additional relief measures, including a payroll tax holiday. Mr. Mnuchin also said that the administration is working on exemptions from tariffs imposed by President Trump that are affecting businesses, and that he would be open to waiving restrictions on withdrawals for 401(k) investments so that people can more readily access their savings.

The Treasury secretary dismissed rumors that markets could shut down because of the recent volatility, and he encouraged banks to turn to the Federal ReserveÃ¢ÂÂs discount window for funding if needed.

Mr. Mnuchin expressed optimism that the current Ã¢ÂÂblack swanÃ¢ÂÂ period would be over in a matter of months, and pent-up demand would jump-start the economy.

A split in Congress: Who should be paid not to work?

A fundamental divide over how many Americans should be paid to stay home from work amid the coronavirus outbreak has emerged as one snag in negotiations over a multibillion-dollar federal response to the mounting health and economic damage from the virus.

House Democrats are set to vote Friday on a bill, negotiated with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that includes several measures meant to combat the spread of the virus and cushion its economic shock to the economy. One of those is a plan to provide paid leave to workers affected by the virus.

A key question is how many workers should be covered by that leave plan, which would ensure compensation for people who do not go to work during the outbreak. Many Republicans want to keep it focused narrowly to workers who have contracted the virus or are forced to care for sick family members or children whose schools have closed Ã¢ÂÂ and they are concerned that the bill, more broadly written, could also encourage healthy people to stay home, thus chilling economic activity.",human
Asking yourself 'What's the meaning of life?' may extend it,"This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .

It's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- both philosophically and practically, in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we rarely, if ever, stop to really think about the answer.

Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous.

And having an answer may even improve your health and help you live longer.

After studying 1,300 subjects from ages 21 to more than 100, the authors found that older people were more likely to have found their life's purpose, while younger people were more likely still searching. That's logical, given that wisdom is often born from experience. According to research by Stanford education professor William Damon, the author of ""The Path to Purpose,"" only 20% of young adults have a fully realized sense of their life's meaning.

And according to the new study, the presence of meaning in one's life showed a positive correlation to one's health, including improved cognitive function, while searching for it may have a slight negative effect. Mental and physical well-being was self-reported, and having a sense of purpose tended to peak around age 60, the study found.

than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered. According to two other studies published in 2014 -- one among 9,000 participants over age 65 and another among 6,000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives lived longerthan those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.

The connection to longevity could be causal -- having purpose may help one cope with daily stress , as other research has shown -- but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.

Or as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is quoted as saying, ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how,"" nicely summing up the connection between having purpose and forbearance in one's life.

Starting an annual meaning of life resolution

The easiest but perhaps healthiest resolution you could make in the New Year may be to simply ask yourself what the meaning of life is for you. What gives you purpose? Why are we all here?

Every January for more than two decades, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question.

The reason I ask it annually is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time.

Great thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is ""to serve others and to do good,"" and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, ""The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity."" And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, ""if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.""

Scottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, ""The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit."" And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to ""throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.""

""Love"" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, ""The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.""

My favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, ""The purpose of life is a life of purpose.""

Some have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. ""There is not one big cosmic meaning for all,"" AnaÃÂ¯s Nin wrote in her diary. ""There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.""

I agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. ""Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded,"" wrote Antoine de Saint-ExupÃÂ©ry, well-known for his book ""The Little Prince.""

Taking a few moments to record your answer to the question ""what is the meaning of life?"" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life.

And then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding.

In 1997, my answer was ""the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss,"" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make ""the world a better place."" In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply ""Love."" And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic ""continuation of one's DNA to the next generation."" But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others.

Subscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.

As a practical matter, if you want to do the annual ""Meaning"" exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.

The last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If ""love,"" is the answer, then love more. If it's ""find your bliss,"" then get searching for it.

This is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful, and longer, life.",human
New packaging and plant-based fish: How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback,"New York (CNN Business) It may not seem like the best time to be in charge of Bumble Bee.

The canned tuna industry has faced all manner of scandals over the past several years. Along with its competitors, Bumble Bee was implicated in a price-fixing scheme four years ago. Bumble Bee agreed to plead guilty for its role in the conspiracy and to pay a $25 million criminal fine. And last year, the company filed for bankruptcy , blaming its ""recent and significant legal challenges."" It has since been acquired by FCF, a Taiwanese fishing company.

The industry has also been plagued by criticism over its fishing practices, which have unintentionally netted dolphins and other marine life. It has also faced claims of human rights violations along its supply chains.

Bumble Bee is coming out with new packaging and new products this year. Its old logo, seen here, will get a makeover.

And Americans are eating less canned tuna. According to a 2018 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, annual per capita consumption of canned tuna has been falling steadily for decades, from 3.7 pounds in 1990 to 2.1 pounds in 2018.

But Jan Tharp, Bumble Bee's CEO since 2018, says things are looking up.

""We are super excited about our future,"" she told CNN Business.

Over the past year and a half, she said, Bumble Bee has been working behind the scenes to revitalize its business. Now, the company is ready to reveal some of its efforts, including new products, a sleek, updated design and a partnership with a plant-based tuna company.

New products and a new look

Bumble Bee is chasing customers by revamping its own image.

For too long, Bumble Bee failed to keep up with the times. New products and new packaging can help, said Tharp.

Tuna should be on-trend, she argued. It's a good source of protein that is low in calories and free of sugar. ""There's absolutely no reason why the category should be down,"" she said. Overall, she said ""the industry can do a better job"" of selling its product.

Younger eaters ""don't like status quo,"" said Brian Choi, managing partner and CEO at the Food Institute, a food industry news and market research company. ""They're looking for bolder flavors,"" he added.

To better connect with today's consumers, Bumble Bee spoke to about 10,000 customers over the course of a year, Tharp said, to get a better sense of what they're looking for. They kept those insights in mind when developing new products and packaging.

Bumble Bee is rolling out new products, and bringing a version of its ""Bistro Bowl,"" now sold in Canada under the Clover Leaf label, to the United States.

This year, Bumble Bee plans to start selling new microwavable ""bistro bowls,"" low-calorie meals containing tuna, vegetables, and rice or pasta. It is also rolling out new ""protein-on-the-run"" snack packs, with crackers, a sea salt caramel chew and tuna in olive oil and zesty lemon, black pepper or sweet jalapeno. And it's launching nine flavors of tuna in pouches, equipped with a spork so people can eat on the run, as well as a similar product in an easy-to-open can with a clear lid.

The company has already been selling tuna in pouches, and the format is performing well. Sales of the product popped 40% by volume in 2019, according to the company.

In addition to launching new flavors and packages, Bumble Bee is rolling out a new, nautical look. Gone is the chef-bee mascot, which can be found peeking over labels on some cans and pouches.

The new packaging calls out the amount of protein per container, features images of the ingredients lending flavor (like onions and chili pepper) and has new messaging. One pack reads ""bee well for life,"" positioning the product as a health food.

In addition to revamping its own image, Bumble Bee is partnering with a plant-based tuna company to attract new customers.

Moving in on plant-based tuna

Beyond Meat BYND Interest in plant-based alternatives to animal products has exploded. The trend kicked off with dairy substitutes, like soy and almond milk, and has been gaining steam with meat substitutes popularized by Impossible Foods and

Many expect plant-based seafood to be the next big thing. Tharp agrees.

""Seafood is coming,"" she said. ""Our customers are looking for that type of option.""

Bumble Bee had been looking for ways to get into the plant-based space for years, said Tharp. But it was having a hard time developing plant-based seafood on its own. So it decided to go into business with Gathered Foods Corporation, which owns plant-based seafood company Good Catch.

Bumble Bee plans to help with Good Catch's sales and distribution through the joint venture.

Good Catch makes plant-based tuna out of legumes.

The partnership is a ""win-win,"" said Tharp. It should help Good Catch scale, and give Bumble Bee a way into a potentially lucrative market. Barclays has predicted that the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion in sales within the next ten years. And the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports plant-based businesses, wrote in a 2019 report that plant-based seafood could ""potentially exceed growth rates in the broader plant-based meat category.""

The Good Catch deal may also help convince customers that Bumble Bee is serious about sustainability.

People who are concerned about meat's environmental impact may have similar concerns over fish. Lost or discarded fishing equipment contributes to plastic waste in the ocean and poses a threat to marine life. Plastic pollution could be dangerous for people, too, if microplastics end up in our food supply. Sustainability is a concern among young people especially, noted Choi.

""We do understand and share the concern regarding the impact of plastic in the ocean, especially as it relates to the pollution aspect of it as well as human health,"" said Tharp. ""We do take that subject extremely seriously, and we know that there's a lot of work and research that still has to be done.""

Bumble Bee is working with the National Fisheries Institute and Michigan State University to support research in the area, she said, adding that it has also joined the Global Ghost Gear Initiative, which aims to remove fishing debris from the ocean.

The company is also working to mitigate its impact on the ocean and marine life by tracing where its products come from. It is also is working with third-party auditors to try to enforce better conditions on fishing boats and in factories, Tharp said.",human
Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

For the last decade, Thomas Sauvin has been purchasing discarded color negatives by the kilogram from a recycling plant outside Beijing. The old 35-millimeter films capture family outings, weddings, birthdays, vacations -- anonymous, everyday memories that would otherwise be lost.

The trader he buys them from, Xiao Ma, usually dissolves the negatives in acid, alongside hospital X-rays and old CD-ROMs, in order to extract the small amount of silver within. But instead, Sauvin takes them away in big rice sacks to find out what else they contain.

Quite how the negatives found their way into people's trash remains a mystery to the French collector and artist. But with the help of a local technician, he scans them in batches before adding the images to his archive.

His ongoing ""Beijing Silvermine"" project paints a compelling picture of a country undergoing profound change. The collection -- which comprises 850,000 photos -- offers an ordinary perspective on life in China that is often overlooked, said Sauvin, who lived in Beijing for over 12 years.

""The way China was depicted through contemporary photography, propaganda and journalism (offered) a portrait far from the one I was witnessing,"" he said in a phone interview. ""There was something more universal, something about collective memories, that started emerging. The photos show a side of China that was never really exported to the West.""

While the resulting images can be, at times, inexplicably surreal (an old man standing in a cacti bush, or a woman posing next to a fake shark), they are often mundane. Yet, after spending a year and half ""looking for gems,"" Sauvin realized that the strength of his archive lay not in occasional humorous discoveries, but in the bigger picture that emerged.

Most of the images were taken between 1985 and the mid-2000s, when the widespread adoption of digital cameras made film largely obsolete. It was a time of rapid economic development, and the photos show how this played out in people's lives: families posing with new household appliances or standing with statues of Ronald McDonald after fast food arrived in China in the early 1990s.

The pictures also document people's changing relationship with the medium of photography, as cameras went from expensive luxuries to everyday items.

""I have one (roll of) film -- 36 images -- that was shot over three-and-a-half years,"" Sauvin said. ""You have three consecutive birthdays of the same person. You can imagine, on very important occasions, the parents would bring out this analog camera, take one photo and then wait six months before taking another one.

""But by 2005, as analog photography becomes (more affordable), you notice that people would go to somewhere like the Summer Palace and take 36 photos in 30 minutes.""

Recurring themes

What remains consistent throughout this period, however, is the pictures' composition and what Sauvin calls ""the ritual"" of photography. Almost all of the images show subjects standing at the center and looking out to the camera.

Some common themes also emerge: women posing with flowers, twins dressed in identical clothing and people interacting with statues or public sculptures. Indeed, the collector found so many photos of people smoking at weddings (Chinese brides would often light cigarettes for male guests as thanks for their attendance) that he was able to publish an entire book of them.

New ideas constantly emerge from the collection. Sauvin's latest exhibition brings together photos from a Beijing amusement park filled with miniature replicas of famous world monuments, from the Kremlin to the Eiffel Tower. Opened in 1993, Beijing World Park encouraged visitors to collect a stamp from each landmark in a mock passport (""Go around the world in just one day,"" its catalog boasted).

What initially appears as a vintage oddity, however, tells a wider story about the country's rise. The exhibition juxtaposes photos of people next to replica landmarks with those of Chinese tourists in front of the real thing. In doing so, he explores how an evident curiosity about the outside world was satiated by the newfound income to holiday around the world.

""It seems to be quite a meaningful place,"" Sauvin said of Beijing World Park, which remains open to this day. ""It was like an educational place for people to start understanding what traveling and tourism was all about.""

Fading memories

Sauvin has become adept at deciphering where, and in what circumstances, old photos may have been taken. But it took seven years for a subject to ever identify themselves in one of his pictures.

The image in question depicts a middle-aged man laid out on rocks beside a lake (""like a mermaid,"" as the collector put it). It was a personal favorite of Sauvin's, and thus had appeared in exhibitions, posters, flyers and even as a sticker. Indeed, he had spent so much time looking at the man's image that he ""knew the guy like he was my grandfather.""

After Sauvin posted the photo on China's Twitter-like microblogging platform, Weibo, a user recognized the subject as his ex-girlfriend's father. Some messages later, the artist met the man at a Beijing restaurant in 2016 -- almost 30 years after the photo was taken by colleagues at an engineering conference.

""He was very happy, and we had a very good time,"" Sauvin said. ""In the end, I offered him a framed copy of the photo and he asked me to sign it. He looked at his wife and said, 'In a couple of years that's going to be worth a lot of money!'""

Although now based in Paris, Sauvin still visits Beijing four or five times a year. The recycler Xiao Ma calls whenever he has recovered enough negatives for a 50-kilogram bag. The price has almost tripled in the decade since the project began, rising from 28 yuan ($4) a kilogram to a ""still very reasonable"" 75 yuan (just under $11).

""It's always a bit of a gamble, because sometimes a 50-kilo bag only comes from one source -- and if that source isn't interesting, then I've just spent 400 Euros,"" he said. ""But that's part of the game, I suppose.""

The supply of negatives may soon run dry. Xiao extracts the most silver from X-rays, but Sauvin said that Chinese hospitals have gone digital, making the trade far less lucrative. But Sauvin also sources negatives from eBay-like websites and visits flea markets, which is where he stumbled across his latest project: old prints hidden in a plastic bag.

""I asked the vendor if I could open it and check inside,"" Sauvin recalled. ""And he said, 'No, you have to buy it.'""

He took the risk. After parting with around 450 yuan ($64), Sauvin looked inside to reveal a series of black-and-white photos depicting athletes mid-leap, their gravity-defying poses assuming an almost sculptural quality.

Sauvin's latest project brings together found photos of athletes from a single day in 1960. Credit: Courtesy Thomas Sauvin

Further investigation revealed that the pictures had been taken by the photography department at Xi'an Physical Education University, in China's Shaanxi province. All had been shot in a single day in June 1960 -- at the height of Mao's Great Leap Forward, the disastrous modernization campaign that plunged the country into economic chaos and famine.

""I've never managed to find a significant number of photos from this era. People were obviously not going to photo studios, because it was a very hard time,"" said Sauvin, who has compiled the images into a new book, ""Great Leaps Forward.""

""The photos were simply beautiful -- very calm, very poetic. The athletes seemed to overcome gravity,""",human

Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"In this weekly column ""Cross-exam,"" Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on ""CNN Newsroom"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.

(CNN) With Tuesday's announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Pelosi has finally put constitutional duty above perceived political expediency.

House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently slow-played the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding Ukraine scandal

Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's own admissions and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump suspended $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.

Trump and his defenders claim his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump stated Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it."" But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection? Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries?

Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was ""very friendly."" That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid.

Trump also claims he exerted ""no pressure"" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could.

And Trump claimed, ""NO quid pro quo."" But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the ""this for that"" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own original statement, made clear he equates ""corruption in Ukraine"" with ""investigate Biden"" and little else: ""All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son.""

So, what crimes could Trump be violation of?

Foreign election aid -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to ""solicit, accept or receive"" a ""thing of value"" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged (""solicited"") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.

While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a ""thing of value."" And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a leading contender to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?

Bribery -- it is illegal for a public official ""directly or indirectly"" to demand, seek, receive or accept any ""thing of value"" in return for ""being influenced in the performance of any official act."" Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding ""influence in the performance of an official act"" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself has drawn that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out ""corruption."" Trump has made clear that he equates ""corruption"" with the Biden investigation.

Extortion is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially ""I'll help you, if you help me,"" while extortion is ""I'll harm you, if you don't help me."" The suspension of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.

Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office.

But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.

Impeachment need not be based on a crime. The Constitution prescribes impeachment for ""treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be drawn from English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.

The Constitution separates impeachment from criminal prosecution. Draft articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to abuse of power for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine).

This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.

Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi is now changing course on impeachment.

By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

Now, your questions

Lee, California: Does the House Intel Committee have a legal right to see the intelligence community whistleblower complaint about Trump?

On its face, the law is straightforward . If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of ""urgent concern"" and (2) ""credible,"" then he or she ""shall submit"" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- reviewed the complaint and found that it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.

But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI concluded that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not ""a member of the Intelligence Community"" and the conduct did not ""involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision."" In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President.

That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.

That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.

Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?

Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution explicitly grants the House the ""sole power of impeachment"" and the Senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments,"" with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.

In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus was impeached and convicted on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.

Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?

As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have openly contemplated utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact, nobody has ever been fined by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama convincingly argues that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.

While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will ""fight all the subpoenas,"" he likely would fight all the fines. Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up.

Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, ""Make me."" Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.

Three questions to watch

1) Will Pelosi finally see the light and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment?

The real terror threat in America is homegrown,"Story highlights Orlando mass killing fits grim pattern of homegrown terrorism, writes Peter Bergen

Since 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes

Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book ""United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.""

(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.

Because 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.

But Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.

In fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.

In other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.

The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"Costa Mesa, California (CNN) David Daleiden wanted to show exactly what a 19-week-old aborted fetus, being held in the hands of a medical technician, looked like. The problem was he didn't have that picture. So he went to the Internet, found something close and inserted it into his documentary.

The photo, two cupped hands holding a tiny male fetus, appeared on screen as dramatic music played. Against this backdrop, a medical technician detailed how she was present when an intact 19-week gestated fetus was aborted at a Planned Parenthood clinic and, she says, harvested for tissue samples.

Daleiden's video failed to mention that the photo and the story do not match.

Abortion photo actually stillborn child

The photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic. It was the stillborn child of Alexis Fretz, whose son was stillborn in 2013. Fretz took the photo and posted it on the Internet to memorialize the son she named Walter.

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

Without Fretz's knowledge, Daleiden and his two-man documentary group called the Center for Medical Progress plucked that photo from her web page and dropped it into his anti-Planned Parenthood documentary.

""Was it clear?"" Fretz asks herself in a CNN interview, ""No it was not clear. Was it deceitful? I don't know that.""

Daleiden told CNN the fact that the photo is not an actual photo of an aborted fetus makes no difference. He insists the fetus is the same age as the one referred to in his film, and he used it only as an illustration.

Misleading video cited in Republican debate

Daleiden also is being criticized for a second, potentially misleading use of video that has found its way into the Republican presidential campaign. GOP candidate Carly Fiorina cited a portion of the Center for Medical Progress videos in which an intact fetus kicks its left leg and moves an arm shortly after being aborted.

Fiorina described the video during CNN's Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential library on September 16, using the horrific image in her call for an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

In an interview in Southern California earlier this month, Daleiden now admits he has no information on where the video was actually taken. There is no evidence it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

Daleiden says the image came from an outside source, an anti-abortion group called the Center For Bioethical Reform and he doesn't know its origin beyond that. A spokesman for the group tells CNN it won't disclose the location either, only that the video in question was paid for. Despite its source, Daleiden again insists the video is only used as an illustration of what an intact aborted fetus would look like, not the actual fetus referred to in his film.

Critics call videos heavily edited, discredited

The two examples of misleading pictures and video have allowed Planned Parenthood and its supporters to label the Center for Medical Progress's entire production a fraud.

Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president with Planned Parenthood, repeated the defense the women's health group and its many supporters have been trying to convey since the first of the Center for Medical Progress's nine videos began to be released online.

""All of the tapes and footage David Daleiden has released out into the world has been heavily edited,"" Laguens told CNN. ""And I think pretty thoroughly discredited.""

Daleiden insists the two uses of video and photos are not misleading, and says the entire controversy has been manufactured by Planned Parenthood and its ""allies in the mainstream media"" in order to divert attention from the main point of his documentary: that Planned Parenthood uses aborted fetal tissue as a revenue source.

Planned Parenthood ends payments

The Center for Medical Progress spent several years taping Planned Parenthood employees, medical directors and some of its affiliate partners discussing the technique, costs and reimbursement payments for the harvesting of fetal tissue samples for scientific research.

The filming was done without knowledge of those speaking. In several instances, CMP argues that Planned Parenthood representatives appear to be bargaining, negotiating and detailing the best ways to collect or ""harvest"" aborted fetuses for maximum financial gain.

In one episode, Dr. Mary Gatter, a medical director for Planed Parenthood, is filmed during a meal discussing her proposal that each tissue sample harvested should fetch a $75 charge.

JUST WATCHED The fight to defund Planned Parenthood Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The fight to defund Planned Parenthood 05:29

Since selling fetal tissue samples is illegal, Planned Parenthood has been quick to label the transactions as reimbursement costs and that they were made only at a tiny fraction of the organization's 700 clinics and affiliates. Planned Parenthood executives continue to claim the videos are heavily edited, taken out of context and deceptive.

But last week Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement costs at any of its clinics for the transfer of fetal tissue-samples. In a letter to the National Institutes of Health, Planned Parenthood's president defended her organization and insisted all transactions in the past were legal. But says the new change in policy was being taken ""...in order to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.""

Contacted after the announcement, Daleiden says the sudden change in policy is an admission that he and his videos were right.

""If the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts were truly legitimate 'reimbursement,' why cancel it?"" Daleiden wrote in a statement to CNN. ""This proves what the Center for Medical Progress has been saying all along -- Planned Parenthood incurs no actual costs, and the payments for harvested fetal parts have always been an extra profit margin.""",human

Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

Vertical farming is an indoor farming method in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases.

While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk , who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming.

""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email.

Kimbal Musk teaches students how to plant a vegetable garden in California.

""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center.

Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" Ã¢ÂÂ with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale Ã¢ÂÂ in less than three months.

Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries.

The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space.

""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report.

It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.

As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University.

Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.

Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable.

Basil growing at the Square Roots farm in Brooklyn.

""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.

At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly.

Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy.""

Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks.""",human
Which generation has it worse? (Opinion),"Jeff Yang: Generation X is bitter

I belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over Ã¢ÂÂ the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.

Yet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution. In return, the world called us slackers. Is there any wonder we're bitter?

Paul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever

Sixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , ""The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history.""

Nearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever

Paul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.

In the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)

I'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.

Dasha Burns: Millennials have an existential crisis

Don't hate us -- we're just confused. We've seemingly made "" changing the world "" with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).

Dasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.

But in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.

This is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.

Of course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.

We're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.

So, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.

We're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.

Dasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.

Pepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation

For me, it's a tale of two cities.

One city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.

Pepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.

Most of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.

But there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a ""cocktail,"" general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.

Our generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.

John Sutter: Hmm, identity crisis...

At 33, I'm a young-ish-but-sorta-old person with a generational identify crisis. I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X. I can quote ""Reality Bites,"" a staple of the 30s to 40s set, but I also use Snapchat.

I'm both and neither. Generation-adjacent. Floating in time.

John Sutter's selfie at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2013, after he finished a reporting trip down the San Joaquin River in California.

I think people in my situation -- the youngish-sorta-getting-older set -- define ourselves mostly in terms of what we're not. Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of ""trend piece"" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment. We millennial-adjacents may seem wayward and indecisive -- but we're light years ahead on all those issues.

It's the boomers holding us back. I mean -- it is, right?

Donna Brazile: We got Steve Jobs and Oprah Winfrey

I'm a proud baby boomer. That's my generation, marked by the proliferating of our parents or grandparents after they returned from World War II.

Donna Brazile at the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington in 1983, which she helped organize.

From the beginning of the 1900s to about the mid-'60s, generations had romantic names: the lost generation, the greatest generation, the silent generation, the baby boomers. Then someone hiccuped and historians went generic: gen X, gen Y and gen Z.

If I were a member of generations X, Y or Z, I'd be miffed. Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all ""me, me, me,"" and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.

For all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Ã¢ÂÂ has to be considered the best. But I am sure some of my friends in the millennial generation would likely say the best is yet to come. Go ahead. Prove me wrong.

Paul Callan: Gen Ys and millennials, stop whining

We baby boomers grew up watching small black and white TVs that carried only four networks that went off the air at midnight. Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.

In school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't ""helicopter"" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.

Paul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.

In 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.

At work, there were ""typewriters,"" ""carbon paper"" for making copies and ""white out"" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented. You had to get it right the first time or you would look like an idiot to the judge because of all the white out on your document. Public telephone calls were made from ""phone booths"": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.

Cigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.

People who owned cars put ""No Radio"" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.

In 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting. A serial killer called ""Son of Sam"" was still on the loose that night. But we survived.

We boomers are tough, resilient, hardworking and creative. Instead of whining, we invented rock 'n' roll.

Matthew Segal: What's holding us back?

Debating which generation is better or cooler is a popular but futile exercise. It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.

Matthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.

To a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.

The cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.

Maybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.

Sarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress

The real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.

Millennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.

Sarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.

We are the most diverse generation in American history. We are also incredibly progressive.

We are creative and have used our ideas to make new things. Boomers invented the Internet, generation X improved it, and millennials found how to bring people closer through it. Even though we join all other generations in hating the nonsense that is the U.S. Congress, we remain optimistic that government can be used as a tool to help people, or, if you're a ""Daily Show"" fan, something to laugh at.

Like those who came before us we're neither better nor worse, good nor bad. We're different, and we bring different experiences and understanding to the table. There's no competition. We're in the same boat trying to do what we can with what we've got to make a better world.

Far from the jewelry workshops of Paris and the showrooms of the world's most rarefied auction houses, a capital of sparkle has developed in the American southwest.

Each winter, some 65,000 visitors descend on Arizona for the Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase to admire and acquire shiny new pieces to brighten up their lives. With thousands of vendors setting up shop and 50 separate shows around the city, it's less an exclusive experience than a cosmic jumble sale where nothing is too large or too ostentatious to catch somebody's eye; and nothing is too unusual to lure in curious passers-by.

While diamonds and precious stones hold a place of honor, there's no shortage of oddities for sale, from animal pelts and skulls to personalized rubber ducks. Over the course of a single day of this year's showcase, which ran from January 30 to February 14, photographer Daniel Arnold saw a $70,000 geode ""the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,"" a baby goat being led around a parking lot by a cowboy, and enough tie-dye to rival a Grateful Dead concert.

""A proper, polished gem show takes over the convention center, and the rest of the city becomes Its swap meet parking lot,"" Arnold said. ""It's an idyllic post-apocalyptic scene, like a very fun version of the end of the world.""

Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout,"WASHINGTON Ã¢ÂÂ Financial markets plunged on Thursday in the biggest one-day drop since the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987, and Congress neared a deal with the White House on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the colossal effect of the coronavirus pandemic.

After a day of intense negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂve resolved most of our differencesÃ¢ÂÂ and the House would vote on Friday on the measure Ã¢ÂÂone way or another.Ã¢ÂÂ It would then go to the Senate, which called off a recess that had been scheduled for next week in anticipation of a compromise.

The legislation, according to a letter Ms. Pelosi sent to her members, will include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, aid for food assistance programs and federal funds for Medicaid. The package also ensures 14 days of paid sick leave, as well as tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses fulfill that mandate. Language was still being drafted for provisions related to family and medical leave, according to a Democratic aide, as staff members worked through the night to prepare the bill.

Ms. Pelosi, in her letter to lawmakers, also said that the House would soon pursue another package Ã¢ÂÂthat will take further effective action that protects the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.Ã¢ÂÂ",human

More than 7,300 coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout South Korea, killing more than 50. It is one of the largest outbreaks outside mainland China, where the deadly virus was first identified. However, the number of new daily infections in South Korea has declined in recent days.

Park said that while he believes the aggregate number of infections is high, he is confident in the job South Korea did to combat the virus' spread and would advise other governments who are dealing with outbreaks to focus efforts on early testing and global cooperation.

The South Korean government has been among the most ambitious when it comes to providing the public with free and easy testing options. It has the ability run about 15,000 diagnostic test per day and has conducted 196,000 tests to date nationwide, free of charge. Authorities in the city of Goyang even set up drive-thru testing booths.

These cases are pending confirmatory testing from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the release said.

The three other cases were identified in Santa Clara County, according to the county's health department. The total number of cases in the county is now seven, the release said.

One of the cases in Santa Clara is a woman with chronic health issues who is hospitalized, the release said. Officials have not said how this person contracted the virus.

The other two cases are a husband and wife, the release said. Both are hospitalized and the husband has chronic health conditions. Both recently traveled to Egypt, the release said.",human
How NBA led in the sports world shutdown,"Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has been a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of ""Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete."" She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia's 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.

He's pleased that his protege and close friend Adam Silver, the current NBA commissioner, on Wednesday night showed the world what bold, intelligent leadership looks like when he announced the league would suspend the NBA season, after one and then two players -- Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz and later teammate Donovan Mitchel l -- said they tested positive for the coronavirus.

After the players' diagnosis, Silver didn't hesitate to make the right call for the NBA, and the right call for America. For me, Silver's decision is a sobering but inspiring reminder that true commitment to social responsibility means that capitalism doesn't always have to mean profits over people.

Within hours of the NBA's decision, other sports leagues followed suit . Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League all took action. MLB called off spring training and delayed its season, MLS suspended play for 30 days, and the NHL suspended its season. The NBA announcement caught many in the sports world by surprise, including a few NBA players -- among them Lakers star LeBron James, who tweeted

""Man we cancelling sporting events, school, office work, etc etc. What we really need to cancel is 2020! Damn it's been a rough 3 months. God bless and stay safe""

But shocking or not, the NBA Ã¢ÂÂ where the average team is valued at more than $2 billion Ã¢ÂÂ showed America a commanding leadership that sadly has been absent as we watch our President Donald Trump, pundits and politicians (on both sides of the aisle) send citizens dangerously confusing messages about the virus and how we can protect ourselves.

Under Commissioner Stern, the league was never afraid to confront important social issues , especially about inequality and injustice in America. Long before it was trendy, Stern initiated a nearly two-month long campaign that included television segments, short Black History Month specials, school and community events with NBA players to celebrate the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr. And that leadership continued under Silver, who has been vocal on LGBTQ issues, going as far as moving the 2017 NBA All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina , after that state's opposition over the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" -- a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people that was widely criticized as discriminatory.

And in stark contrast to the NFL and how it handled Colin Kaepernick's police brutality protests, Commissioner Silver offered unconditional support to NBA players who protested and spoke out against the police killings of unarmed black men and women along with the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

""Part of the reason NBA players are more active is that it's been part of the culture of this league for generations and passed down to them,"" Silver told CNN in 2018.

It was disappointing, but not surprising , that the often-maligned National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hesitated to suspend the college basketball season. But you see, it's March Madness Tournament time in college. And March Madness is a cash cow for just about everyone associated with college sports, except the players, who get paid zilch.

There's no doubt the NCAA Ã¢ÂÂ with more than 1,200 member schools that have student populations that range from the hundreds to the tens of thousands Ã¢ÂÂ is responsible for a much larger population than the NBA (30 teams with 15 to 20 players). But for me, that doesn't preclude the organization from taking a clear leadership role to try to protect its players in the best possible way from the coronavirus health crisis. And ultimately agreeing to cancel March Madness and other winter and spring sports is a good decision.

While athletes are paid nothing, in 2019 alone, the NCAA earned $933 million from media rights fees, ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and advertising sales around the three-week-long tournament.

Off the court, fans filled out tournament brackets and wagered $8.5 billion on March Madness.

The highly watched March Madness games are a boon for television networks, who all compete for broadcasting rights. In 2016, CBS and Turner Sports paid the NCAA an additional $8.8 billion to extend their March Madness rights through 2032. Their original deal, from 2011-2024, had cost over $10.8 billion. (Turner Sports is owned by CNN's parent company.)

Initially on Wednesday, the organization announced an eyebrow-raising plan to confront the pandemic health crisis. It said the tournament would go on as scheduled, but fans would not be allowed to attend the games. Instead, the games would go on with select family members, staff and game officials allowed in the arena. To many observers, it was as if NCAA officials hadn't been paying full attention at all to the warnings and safety measures put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I mean exactly what did the NCAA envision happening? Players would use a Clorox wipe to disinfect the ball every time it was passed to them? Or, that no one would touch their face to swipe sweat from their eyes? Good grief. Anyone who's ever bounced a basketball will tell you that's impossible.

But unlike professional sports leagues, where highly paid athletes are protected by players unions and sports agents, especially when issues of player safety are concerned, college athletes must do as the NCAA demands.

So most sports fans know to give the side-eye to any and all NCAA decisions, when it comes to issues of player safety and profits. And sadly, the NCAA's stumbling toward a decision to cancel March Madness on Thursday only served as a reminder that the organization cannot be trusted to protect players.

Regardless of what many fans believe, student-athlete life is not easy. It's often not even fun -- the missed holidays and summer vacations with friends and family, the nearly impossible demands of trying to keep grades up while spending most of your days in the gym, or on the road going to games. It's exhausting.

No doubt, millions of college athletes are disappointed by the way the season has ended -- in basketball and many other spring sports now being canceled as campuses close or move instruction online. I know many are crushed that all their sacrifices to play sports have come to this sad ending and I am sad for them. It feels incredibly unfair. We teach our kids about self-sacrifice and being good citizens, but it's a bitter pill to swallow when we are called upon to make those sacrifices in such stark terms as the ones unfolding right now.

March Madness is my favorite time of year. Call me sappy but the tournaments remind me of the power of the human spirit to rise to our greatest challenges. We dream of Cinderella teams winning out over big-moneyed programs. We look for David and Goliath epic battles and stories of redemption. Watching March Madness makes me feel like a kid again.

Sports has been my sanctuary. The place I go to forget my worries and beat back my fears for a few hours. As a student-athlete, a fan, and later a sports journalist, I have had sports as my constant joy. But today, it feels like there is no sanctuary from the chaos. We awake each day to renewed fears of the coronavirus and toxic political talk.

Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"Image copyright La Voix du Nord Image caption Toilet queues spurred Nathalie Des Isnards to start her company making women's urinals

A few years ago, Nathalie Des Isnards was attending a music festival with her husband David, and planning to watch her favourite group.

Before the show, they headed to the toilets. ""I spent 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pee,"" she recalls. Much to her frustration, she missed the first part of the concert.

Meanwhile David took just ""two minutes"", and saw the whole show.

""I was upset. I told myself, 'We're in the 21st century, something should be done about that.'""

She set about creating a women's urinal. The simple seatless basin she devised is housed in a cubicle with roof and door, designed for faster use but also privacy. ""I was not a designer. I was a user first,"" says the 46-year-old.

Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

However, thanks to social media, and growing competition between event organisers, she thinks the issue is getting more attention.

""[It] forces them to offer better services,"" she explains. Also, organisers now realise, when women are queuing, they're not spending money.

Des Isnards says 100,000 women used madamePee last year, at 15 events across France, including the Women's World Cup. ""It fits all women, not only young ones open to innovation.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption MadamePee hopes women's urinals will lead to shorter queues at events such as festivals and marathons

Two units have been also been installed in Paris as public amenities, she says. This year the loo will be in several other countries.

""The ambition is very clear. It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,"" says the French entrepreneur.

Even newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.

Copenhagen-based architects, Gina PÃÂ©rier and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.

""It's just insanely more efficient,"" says Ms PÃÂ©rier, 25.

The idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival. ""I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,"" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. ""There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.""

Image copyright Eric Delafosse Image caption Lapee is 'insanely more efficient' say its creators

According to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate.

The team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.

Getting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. ""We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,"" she tells me.

Lapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.

Ms PÃÂ©rier says Lapee is also targeting, ""public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.""

The start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year.

They're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.

More Technology of Business

Other urinal products have launched with varying success.

Perhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up.

Sam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.

""The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,"" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further.

Mr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.

Gail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.

""It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,"" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.

""Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption Research suggests women take up to twice as long to use toilets

Women typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned.

""We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,"" Ms Ramster says.

""Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.""

Researchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times.

But the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women.

""For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,"" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. ""This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].""

It could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them.",human
Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak,"Zunar and Fahmi Reza's art was a boon to protesters sick of the alleged corruption of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it nearly landed the two men in prison.

A humongous pink gemstone perches on a woman's finger, matched only in extravagance by her hair, which is half the height of her body. A pendulous necklace and HermÃÂ¨s handbag hang from her other arm.

For Malaysians, the figure pictured is instantly recognizable as Rosmah Mansor, wife of disgraced former Prime Minister Najib Razak and -- according to prosecutors in the US and Malaysia -- a modern day Imelda Marcos who accrued luxury goods worth millions of dollars using money embezzled from the state investment fund, 1MDB.

Also instantly recognizable is the artist behind the picture, which has pride of place at an exhibition in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur. Political cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Haque, better known as Zunar, has spent most of the last decade lampooning Najib and Rosmah, even as the risks for doing so grow ever greater.

Zunar's work welcomes visitors to ""Democracy in Action,"" a recent exhibition that would have been impossible to stage only a year ago. In one cartoon, a hand holding chopsticks marked ""China"" reaches over to pluck Malaysia off a platter marked ""1MDB scandal."" In another, a huge diamond ring, a handbag and a bag of cash come together, Transformers-style, to form an image of Rosmah.

At the center sits Zunar's motto: ""How can I be neutral ... even my pen has a stand.""

That motto has been severely tested in recent times. Just last year, it seemed almost certain that Zunar would end up in prison. A number of his books had been banned, and while his work was still widely shared online, the artist faced multiple charges of sedition and committing acts deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy."" Unknown assailants attacked him at a gallery show, police seized his works and he was banned from leaving the country.

Then, in a shock election result, a coalition of opposition parties turfed Najib out of office, promising to clamp down on corruption and reverse the country's turn toward authoritarianism.

Now Zunar is watching as his the political figures who were once his nemeses and muses face decades behind bars themselves -- in part because artists like him helped bring attention to their alleged corruption and disdain for the rule of law.

Zunar tells CNN that it's his mission to save Malaysia. Credit: James Griffiths/CNN

""The medium of cartooning is (a) very powerful medium,"" Zunar told CNN at his small studio in a Kuala Lumpur suburb. ""Everywhere, in any country you go, (cartoonists) get killed. Cartoonists, get arrested, put in jail everywhere because of the medium.""

Fellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.

""Using satire and humor is effective because it breaks the fear barrier,"" he said in a phone interview.

""People had always been afraid to speak out. The culture of fear is always there; the culture of self-censorship is always there. That's where satire and humor can be the most effective tool, it makes people less afraid.""

Cartoonist's muse

After a number of false starts, Zunar's career as a political cartoonist was flagging when his nemesis emerged on the political scene in the 1990s.

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Najoib's wife Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Credit: Zunar

In many ways, the artist's career trajectory rose in tandem with that of Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers who climbed quickly through the ranks of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, initially as deputy prime minister and then to the premiership itself in 2009.

As Najib's star grew, so did the frustration of his critics. Detractors delighted in seeing him brought back down to Earth by Zunar's increasingly exaggerated, grotesque portrayals.

More even than Najib however, Zunar found his muse in Rosmah. He did, however, face more difficulty publishing cartoons of her, versus those of the Prime Minister.

""When my book came out with Najib on the cover, I could at least release it,"" Zunar said. When Rosmah was the subject however, ""the police came and stopped the launch ... (from this) we can understand that maybe that she is more powerful.""

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When police raided the couple's properties in Kuala Lumpur last year, they seized jewelry and gemstones worth over $109 million. Around $13 million worth of HermÃÂ¨s handbags were also confiscated, along with cash and other goods totaling over $100 million.

Many of the items were, allegedly, purchased with money embezzled from the 1MDB state investment fund, set up by Najib. Rosmah has pleaded not guilty, and due to numerous delays in the legal system, has yet to end up in court.

The 1MDB scandal -- and Rosmah's spending -- became a central theme of Zunar's work. In particular, the artist sought to make a connection between the allegedly embezzled funds and the Malaysian people: One cartoon showed Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal's waste.

""Zunar has such a finely developed sense of what is right and what is fair,"" said Robert Russell, executive director of the Cartoonists Rights Network International. ""Like any good political cartoonist he has this well-developed sense of righteous indignation.""

Russell said Zunar's cartoons were so effective, in part, because they undercut concerted efforts by the government to present itself, particularly overseas, as a legitimate and clean administration. Using a combination of journalism and art, Zunar highlighted the instances where this was not the case.

But doing so would ultimately endanger his freedom, as Najib's government took a hard authoritarian turn in an attempt to stifle criticism.

Clowning around

Beginning in 2010, Zunar was questioned multiple times under the Sedition Act , a colonial-era law widely denounced by human rights groups as draconian.

In 2016, he was charged with taking actions deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy"" over a series of cartoons depicting government corruption. Police seized hundreds of his books, and unknown assailants attacked him at an exhibition.

Later that year, Zunar was slapped with a travel ban after he visited Geneva to accept the Cartooning for Peace Award. The ban, according to free-speech group IFEX, ""appear(ed) to be an attempt to damp down the growing international publicity (surrounding) Zunar and his work.""

Zunar was not the only artist to face blowback for satirizing Najib. In June 2016, Fahmi Reza was charged with two counts of violating section 233(1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, which forbids disseminating online content deemed to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass others.

Fahmi had depicted Najib as a clown with big red lips and arched, thick eyebrows. The image quickly caught on with Malaysians sick of the widespread allegations of corruption, and it soon became a common sight at anti-government protests.

Like Zunar, Fahmi had a record of trouble with the authorities. In 2004 , he designed a poster for a demonstration against police brutality, and volunteered to help print and distribute leaflets and other materials.

Unfortunately for him, Fahmi's conscientiousness was his downfall. Arriving ahead of most other protesters, police saw him with a large number of posters and banners. He was quickly arrested.

""I panicked and I was afraid,"" Fahmi told CNN. ""But I think surviving that made me bolder, knowing that the poster I made was having an effect on these people who abused their power.""

When he was arrested again in 2016, Fahmi was ""fully prepared,"" he said.

""One sign that whatever you're doing is effective is when the authorities and people in power react,"" he added. ""If they ignore it, then there's no impact. That's how the whole clown thing became a symbol of protest -- because of the overreaction by the authorities.""

Satire as a weapon

Both cartoonists' arrests made international headlines, helping to highlight Najib's growing authoritarianism to the outside world. Protesters also delighted in using the caricatures of Najib and Rosmah on posters and placards after it was revealed how much the artists had irritated them.

As Malaysia's opposition grew ever more determined to oust Najib -- with many observers warning that 2016's general election might be their last chance to do so -- the government passed new legislation to control what people could say about it.

In early 2018, it introduced a new law to crack down on ""fake news"" that critics said was so broadly defined that it could easily be used to shut down and criminalize criticism of Najib.

Eventually however, the wave of dissent was too great for Najib to overcome. Even though the electoral map was redrawn in his favor, he lost heavily. With an 82.32% turnout, an opposition coalition led by current Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad took 121 of 222 seats. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition won just 79.

Uncertain future

Since Najib's downfall, charges against Zunar and Fahmi have been dropped, though the latter is still fighting to have an earlier conviction overturned.

Both men said that, while they felt considerably freer under the new government, true reform has yet to be delivered.

""(The government is) more tolerant toward online dissent and criticism -- and even insults,"" Fahmi said, despite the fact that the ""online content"" law used to prosecute him is still on the books.

""People know it's still there, so I think some people are still afraid to voice their criticism openly,"" Fahmi said.

Zunar said the new government's most important task is to ""repair the damage"" done by previous regimes. He is willing to give them time to do so, but as for the future, ""we don't know yet.""

Russell, of Cartoonists Rights Network International, said Zunar faces a situation similar to that of other dissident cartoonists when their former oppressors leave office.

In the last year of Najib's rule, Zunar was banned from leaving the country. Credit: Zunar

""Even with Zunar's heroes ... now in a new government, he's going to start drawing the same cartoons about them,"" he said. ""This is not necessarily a happy ending. If Zunar is true to his roots, he will be as ruthless with the new government as any (other) government.

In the short term, Zunar is facing a more pressing concern: the loss of his muse, Rosmah.

While she has largely disappeared from Malaysia's political scene while her husband attempts to reinvent himself as a man-of-the-people government critic, the former prime minister's wife remains present inside Zunar's studio, her cartoon face staring up from numerous books and picture frames.

""I miss Rosmah,"" the artist said. ""For me, she was a god send. Very easy to draw, very cartoonable. Her character is very cartoonable.

""As a cartoonist, I miss her. When Trump goes one day, American cartoonists will miss him too.""",human

(CNN) To date, over 125,000 cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported worldwide -- with more than 4,000 fatalities. Over 1,400 cases have been reported in the US alone, a number that will surely grow in the coming weeks. Miraculously, though, our country's prisons and jails, many of them unsanitary environments, have yet to experience an outbreak.

But that will likely change, and soon. ""We know that at some point we're going to have a case,"" said Patty Hayes , director of public health for Seattle and King County, Washington, this week, referring to a potential coronavirus case in local jails.

It isn't a matter of if, but when. And when the inevitable takes place, it could have a deadly impact.

Of the 2.3 million incarcerated people in the US, roughly 165,000 are over the age of 55. And compared to the general population, people in jail and prison are more likely to have preexisting health conditions such as high blood pressure, asthma, cancer, arthritis and infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C and HIV. We're still learning about the coronavirus, but what we do know so far is that these two populations are most at risk of falling ill or dying from it.

SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of "" SE Cupp Unfiltered ."" The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.

This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.

And a third party that makes it its raison d'etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.

Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up -- and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we're usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren't good enough.

The immigration disconnect

Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders --that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.

As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.

Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted : ""Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it's time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.""

What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters -- or who had read recent polls -- was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.

According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.

But this was a Democratic primary -- the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?

No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn't. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.

Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.

What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?

The politics of extremes

This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.

On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.

Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in ""the Squad"" -- Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley -- get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.

A so-called "" alterna-squad ,"" a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I've heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, ""Well I can't vote for Trump, but I'm not with those guys, either.""

In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that ""finding common ground"" is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence ""a decent guy."")

Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most ""divisive.""

The silent middle majority

Take abortion. ""[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,"" according to Pew . Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us -- the majority -- agree it should be legal but with restrictions.

Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.

A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn't those voters feel betrayed by that?

Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties' willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.

While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don't , what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.

Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally -- a path to legal status -- if they meet some requirements over time.

And as it turns out, that's what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we're to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.

So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?

Legislative solutions aren't profitable

Here's the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn't as politically profitable as keeping them broken.

Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.

Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.

As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to ""own the Libs,"" and Democratic voters are happy being ""the resistance,"" it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.

Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.

Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.

All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That's likely only going to get worse.

A party by the middle and for the middle

A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn't be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn't take this position or that one, and it wouldn't have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.

For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican -- a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew , a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.

That third party would also lean pro-abortion -- keeping Roe v. Wade in place -- but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.

It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn't, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.

It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.

In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn't on either extreme. There wouldn't be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn't have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.

One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can't, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.

Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.

There's also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.

So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.

Finally, whether an alternative party in today's age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn't swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn't designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one's blood pressure almost instantly.

Because let's face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America's future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we'll all be politically homeless eventually.",human
'We are not alone': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy,"(CNN) The whole of Italy has been put on lockdown , as the government desperately tries to gain control of the coronavirus spread.

On Tuesday, thriving cities like Rome, Milan and Venice became ghost towns . Italians are facing a new reality of life with a curfew, travel restrictions and enforced space between people in public places, as the country reports more than 9,000 infections and more than 630 deaths.

CNN spoke to Beniamino Pagliaro , a journalist for national newspaper la Repubblica, who described the measures as unprecedented.

What are you seeing on the streets?

I'm in Rome, and the streets are basically empty. Rome is pretty famous for traffic jams, but there are none at the moment, there is very little traffic.

Like in many offices, most people (at Repubblica) are working from home. Many of our colleagues have children and schools are closed. People were told to work from home for health reasons first, but there just isn't anywhere for children to go.

I live in the Trastevere, and there is a joke about the area, that one in two people are tourists. On a normal day, you can hear lots of people talking in English or Russian. These days, you don't see tourists at all.

In the past week, I've been to Milan, and also there you can feel the city is half-closed. Restaurants are empty.

But don't get me wrong, I think the government was right to choose these rules.

Journalist Beniamino Pagliaro warns other countries may face a similar situation to Italy's soon.

How are people responding to the measures?

They are listening. If you watch how less crowded the cities are, you can tell that something has changed,

Most people are trying to cancel travel. Many friends are canceling trips back to their families' homes. Some friends of mine who live in Rome or Milan, they often go home to stay with family, but their parents are older, so they're canceling because the risk is higher for older people.

People are communicating a lot on social media, sharing what TV shows they're watching, what books they're reading.

People are mostly staying at home with their children. They can go for a run outside while gyms are closed, and some people are meeting in small groups.

I'm not proud to say this, but when (Prime Minister) Conte announced the new measures -- the lockdown of the entire country, bringing the whole country to the same level as Lombardy -- at that moment, some people panicked and there were hundreds of people running to supermarkets in the night to buy things. I'm afraid we are still very irrational in these kind of things.

But this happens in London, Berlin and New York, it's not just Italians.

What is it like looking from the inside to the outer world?

This is a really tough situation. I wrote a story this morning about how it's very worrying and scary to me, that most capitals around the world seem not to have understood how deep a change we need.

Reading news of the UK and United States, what they are doing is what we were doing two weeks ago. The pattern is very, very clear, like you are in denial because you think you can act in another way, but then facts and scientists tell us the only way is to slow down -- you cant stop it -- but slowing down the virus will mean a lot less problems in your hospitals.

In Italy, we were lucky to experience the outbreak in an area with plenty of hospitals like Milan, because if you had this spread of the virus in southern Italy, for example, it really could be a mess.

I know that some parts of the UK and some parts of the US especially are not very well-equipped. In the US, there's also a known situation about healthcare costs.

How do you describe this moment?

So it's a tough moment but also it may force everyone to do the right thing.

Of course, it could be boring to postpone events or travel, but then the good thing in this spread of the virus is that people will understand that we are used to thinking about ourselves. While this spread is happening, it's very clear we are not alone, and so you have to think about the whole of society.

If you put together all the populist movements in the recent years, it was all about ""me wanting this"" and ""me wanting that."" British people who want to be isolated, or to remain -- this makes very clear that the world we live in, we cannot just count just on ourselves, we are together.

Fraudsters get hefty prison terms for impersonating French minister,"(CNN) Criminals who impersonated French government minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to con wealthy individuals out of 80 million euros as part of an elaborate scam were handed lengthy sentences Thursday.

A court in Paris sentenced Gilbert Chikli to 11 years in jail for fraud in an organized gang, criminal association, and taking the name of a third party, Le Drian's lawyer Delphine Meillet told CNN. Anthony Lasarevitsch received seven years for fraud in an organized gang and criminal association. The pair will also have to pay 2 million euros and 1 million euros in fines respectively.

The fraudsters tried to pull off what some in France are calling the scam of the century by impersonating Le Drian, Minister for Europe and foreign affairs, and conning wealthy individuals out of 80 million euros purportedly to help pay ransoms to free French hostages being held by Islamist terrorists.

A third defendant, Sebastian Zawadzki, was sentenced in absentia to five years' imprisonment and handed a 1 million euro fine for acts of fraud in an organized gang. He remains at large but a warrant has been issued for his arrest.

Meillet hailed the ""very heavy"" sentences.

(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ There's no shortage of reasons to fall in love with Japan

Whether you're hunting down top eats in Tokyo and Osaka or basking in the country's stunning landscapes , it's impossible to take it all in in one visit. But you'll certainly have a good time trying.

We've built the ultimate cheat sheet of top Japan experiences to help you plan your next visit. Also, be sure to click through the gallery on the top of this story of beautiful Japan destinations for more travel inspo.

THE GREAT OUTDOORS

Though Japan might be most famous for its dazzlingly modern cities, you'll want to spend at least a few days exploring its stunning natural offerings. This is a nation that truly has it all, from rocky mountain peaks to white-sand beaches.

Here are few Japan experiences that will allow for both relaxation and adventure.

Winter sports

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

Nagano, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998, has long been a snowy escape for global travelers. But in recent years, Niseko on the northern island of Hokkaido has become another leading destination for powder hunters thanks to its fresh, quality snow and amazing food scene.

Down on the island of Honshu, meanwhile, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture offers skiing, onsen (more on that later) and ""snow monsters.""

For something completely different, the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route , dubbed the ""Roof of Japan,"" offers travelers a chance to drive down a highway framed by massive walls of snow that tower as high as 17 meters over the road.

Beach hopping

It's easy to see why this stunning Iwate prefecture beach was named ""Jodogahama,"" or Pure Land. JNTO

Being an island nation, Japan's beach offerings are just as impressive as its skyscrapers and bullet trains.

In the north of Japan's main island, Jodogahama Beach (Pure Land in English) is a tranquil hidden beach with crystal-clear water and stark white rocks.

If you prefer softer (and darker) sand, Ibusuki Beach is your dream destination. The subtropical beach is famed for a unique activity -- sand bathing, or suna-mushi.

For island hoppers, you can check out a series of 260 tiny pine tree-covered islands in Matsushima.

Onsen soaking

For anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm. It's the rule.

The word ""onsen"" refers to Japan's natural hot springs but it also can represent facilities like spas and inns that pipe the waters into their own bathing areas.

Though thousands of onsen exist throughout the country, Beppu is Japan's hot spring capital -- and for good reason. It's home to more than 2,500 hot springs and is the world's second-largest source of thermal spring water.

For travelers with ink, however, stripping down at a Japanese onsen can get tricky as many ban tattoos, which have been associated with yakuza gangs.

Fortunately, there's Tattoo-Friendly , a website featuring properties that allow ink. Users can narrow down the search by choosing the type of facility they want to visit -- gym, pool, hotel-and-ryokan (inn) or sento (public baths).

Each listed property includes a brief description of the place and its amenities, as well its specific policies on tattoos.

Hanami

For just a few weeks every spring, Japan celebrates an annual ritual known as hanami: stopping to view and appreciate the beautiful spring blossoms.

It's so popular the Japan Weather Association's annual sakura (cherry blossom) forecast is broadcast live on TV, while the Japan National Tourism Organization has a regularly updated timetable of cherry blossoms predictions on their website.

Hiking

Being a mountainous nation, trekking is an extremely popular Japan activity.

For a spiritual journey, try Kumano Kodo , a multiday pilgrimage across Wakayama prefecture -- fueled by great food, cute rural villages and rich culture along the way.

More than a thousand years ago, imperial leaders and aristocrats made their way to the main Kumano Kodo shrines through a network of hikes across the island. At the end of the hike we recommend spending the night at a temple in the mountaintop town of Koyasan , the center of Shingon Buddhism.

Here, ancient cedar forests share space with historic pagodas, paved roads, restaurants, schools, cafes and souvenir shops.

The enchanting Yakushima forest (the setting for Hayao Miyazaki's epic film Princess Mononoke) on Kyushu island and the Sagano bamboo forest on the outskirts of Kyoto are other family-friendly places to enjoy a quiet walk in Japan.

TRADITION

Japan excels at striking the right balance between tradition and modernity, leading the way in technological advances while also embracing its past, whether it's architecture, art, fashion, food or sports.

Here are a few experiences that will give you a taste for Japan's traditional side.

Stay in a ryokan

Looking for that classic Japanese inn experience, complete with tatami floors, onsen and sliding doors?

Staying in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese guesthouse, is the way to go. Catering to all budgets, they can be found throughout Japan -- most commonly in the countryside outside of urban centers.

Guests are encouraged to wear yukata (house kimonos) and socks, while traditional Japanese meals are prepared in-house.

Tea ceremonies

CNN's Paula Newton travels to Fukuoka and the surrounding tea-rich lands to experience the traditional winter tea ceremony.

The Japanese tea ceremony, or chado , is a traditional way of preparing and serving matcha (top quality green tea).

To make it, green tea leaves, grown in the shade, are dried and ground into a fine powder. This allows the tea to retain its nutrients. During the ceremony, which focuses on the rituals and mental states achieved in the process, the powder is whisked with hot water in a small bowl until a slight foam appears.

The top place to experience Japan's matcha tea ceremony -- or just enjoy a few cups of the precious drink -- is Kyoto. There are plenty of tea making classes and demonstrations available in English and other languages.

Kimonos

Japan's most beautiful traditional attire, kimonos are undeniably an expensive souvenir to bring home. One reason for their hefty price tag is the painstakingly detailed process that goes into making them.

Another reputable kimono-making company is Okaju in Kyoto, founded in 1855 and now helmed by the fourth generation Shigeo Okajima.

If you'd simply like to don one during your Japan visit, there are a number of rental companies throughout Kyoto.

Prefer to appreciate these beautiful garments from afar? Kyoto's Gion district is where travelers can view graceful geishas, traditional Japanese entertainers, walking down the street in their kimonos.

Sumo watching

Sumo is as ancient as it is quintessentially Japanese. Historians agree that the sport dates back at least 2,000 years, and in its current form has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period.

But scoring a seat at one of Japan's six major sumo tournaments per year might as tough as getting into the ring and wrestling yourself, though with a little advance planning you can make it happen. Tickets are available through Japan's official sumo website

There are other ways to get close to a sumo wrestler.

When they're not competing, sumo wrestlers train year round in designated sumo stables, or beya.

These stables, which are mostly based in Tokyo's Ryogoku neighborhood, are where the city's wrestlers live, eat, sleep and practice on a near daily basis. In recent years, it's become more common for foreigners to visit the morning practice, which begins at about 5 a.m. and lasts three to four hours.

CUISINE

Sushi

l e v a r t

Chances are, sushi is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think ""Japanese food.""

More than just a slice of fish over vinegar rice -- that is only one type, called nigiri -- mastering the art of sushi can easily take a lifetime. Luckily, there's Sushi University , where travelers can learn to distinguish nigiri from nori-maki.

Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.

Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.

If you're up for a splurge, Sushisho Masa (106-0031 Tokyo, Minato City,Nishiazabu, 4 ChomeÃ¢ÂÂ1Ã¢ÂÂ15) in Tokyo's Roppongi neighborhood is nothing short of perfection.

And then of course there's Sukiyabashi Jiro , the fabled restaurant in Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world. Hidden in a basement attached to the Ginza Metro Station, Sukiyabashi Jiro earned global fame following the 2012 documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi.""

Kobe beef

Only 3,000 cattle are classified as Kobe grade each year. ÃÂ©JNTO

Known for its pervasive marbling and melt-on-your-tongue texture, Kobe beef is one of Japan's most prized meats.

A type of Wagyu beef named after the region in which the cattle are raised, Kobe is relatively rare -- only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade.

This has caused a fair bit of confusion but here's an easy way to remember it. Wagyu (which literally means ""Japanese cow"") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline.

The Kansai region, where Osaka is based, produces the three ""king"" varieties of Wagyu: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty.

Soba

Want a seat at Kyourakutei? You'll have to wait in line. CNN meets up with the man behind this popular Michelin-starred Tokyo soba restaurant.

Soba, or Japanese buckwheat noodles, are usually served cold with dipping sauce (called zaru soba) or served hot in dashi broth.

Triumphing over them all is te-uchi, which means ""handmade,"" soba in Japanese. The hand-kneaded and cut soba offers the best firmness and, hence, is more much tastier than the mass-produced variety.

For a truly unique soba experience, head to Iwate, a prefecture in Japan's northeast where you can enjoy a 400-year-old all-you-can-eat noodle tradition called "" wanko soba .""

One wanko soba restaurant claims a diner ate 570 bowls in one sitting.

Yakitori

One of the best reasons to visit a pub in Japan? Yakitori, Japanese style chicken skewers. ÃÂ©JNTO

A yakitori restaurant is where you can sample every part of the chicken -- from chicken breast to skins to gizzards -- all presented on skewers, Japanese style.

Tokyo's Torikado is one of the best places to enjoy them. A high-end omakase yakitori restaurant, Torikado's diners will leave it up to the chef to decide what they eat.

Another popular way to chow down a few chicken skewers is with a beer at an izakaya, or casual Japanese pub. Here's our selection of the best (and affordable) izakaya in Tokyo

Kaiseki

Kaiseki meals were originally intended to be enjoyed before a tea ceremony.

Japan travelers researching a trip to Kyoto will inevitably come across the word ""kaiseki.""

To the outsider, it appears to simply be a multicourse Japanese dinner made up of beautifully plated dishes. But there's so much more to this meticulously prepared, exquisitely served and, usually, very expensive meal.

To practitioners of this haute cuisine, kaiseki is the embodiment of ""omotenashi,"" which means wholehearted hospitality.

Ramen

Ramen is the ultimate Japanese comfort food. ÃÂ©Hiroshima Prefecture/ÃÂ©JNTO

Nothing's more comforting than slurping back a bowl of ramen on a cold rainy day.

There are four basic styles of the world-famous soup-based dish: Shoyu (soy sauce seasoning); shio (a light soy sauce version of shoryu); miso (made with fermented soy beans); and tonkotsu (a creamy-white pork bone broth).

CNN Travel asked Brian Mac, founder of the blog Ramen Adventures , to share some of his favorite ramen varieties in Tokyo and beyond, which include Hokkaido's miso ramen, Kyushu's Kumamoto ramen and all kinds of shoyu variations. Read more about them here

Sake

A one-minute tour of Japan's northern Tohoku region, which produces some of the country's best bottles of sake.

Japanese rice wine, sake has a long-standing history dating back to the third century.

It's produced all over the country -- and many brewers are open to tours -- but Japan's Tohoku region in the northeast is where you'll find some of the best bottles.

Part of what makes Tohoku's sakes so different is geography: The winters are severe with heavy snowfalls and historically, because of its remoteness, agriculture has been the mainstay in Tohoku.

For visitors making the trip north, several breweries offer tours in English, as well as tastings -- but you will need to book in advance via their websites.",human
"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","How do you feel?

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a simple question, right? And unless youÃ¢ÂÂre talking to a doctor, you probably have a simple answer.

And if thatÃ¢ÂÂs the case, the odds are that youÃ¢ÂÂre lying.

Such, anyway, is always my view of the human race after listening to a cast recording of a Stephen Sondheim musical, or even to just one of his ballads. And when it comes to emotions, Sondheim Ã¢ÂÂ more than any other composer from the Broadway songbook Ã¢ÂÂ is the one I trust to tell me the truth.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because in the world of Sondheim, feelings never come singly but in battalions. Even his simplest, most assertive melodies usually sound as if theyÃ¢ÂÂre being pulled in contradictory directions.

Of course, his ever-nimble lyrics Ã¢ÂÂ which have made his name a byword for verbal cosmopolitanism Ã¢ÂÂ abound in paradoxes, puns and declarations of uncertainty, all etched into deep-burrowing grooves. But the music adds yet another layer, which often both confirms and battles with the words.",human
Indian MP: Our nation's glorious tradition of religious tolerance is being shredded,"Manish Tewari is a Member of Parliament representing Shri Anandpur Sahib Lok Sabha Constituency. He is a ranking member of the opposition party, the Indian National Congress and was a former Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) India witnessed one of the most melancholy moments in its recent past when the eminent historian Ramachandra Guha was dragged away by the Bengaluru police during the anti Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

His apparent offense? Participating in the right of dissent that is the holy grail of any constitutional democracy. Guha and others have rightfully taken a stand against the Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by the upper and lower houses of India's Parliament, which is vague and unconstitutional because it makes fast-tracked citizenship dependent on one's religion.

Watching Ramachandra Guha being taken away reminded me of his riveting exposition on why India is the most fascinating country in the world. The central thesis being how India had emerged as a religiously pluralistic society when most nations have defined themselves through a monotheist lens.

Indeed, India can be said to be a utopia that defines itself by the phrase ""unity in diversity."" I wrote in an earlier op-ed that ""out of a bloodstained Partition there emerged two ideas of nationhood -- a progressive, pluralistic and inclusive impulse that became the idea of the Republic of India and a theocratic template that became the idea of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."" Sadly the events playing out through the actions of the government depict a trajectory that is distinct from the vision of a pluralistic society.

India has been the birthplace of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, which add to its cultural smorgasbord. Even the Abrahamic religions have a unique history in India. Syriac Christians in India emerged shortly after Christ died and 600 years before Islam came into being. History records that Thomas the first, one of Jesus' 12 apostles, landed in Kerala to spread Christianity and today, he is buried in Tamil Nadu. The country today is host to a significant population of the Christian faith.

Islam came peacefully to the south and has a slightly more complicated history up north. Today, India has the second largest Muslim population in the world, despite not being an Islamic country. India is one of the few countries which houses members of the Jewish diaspora who have never faced any form of state-led persecution.

More interesting is the story of the Parsi community and their arrival in India. While fleeing religious persecution in Persia, they docked on Indian shores, in modern day Gujarat. Apocryphal tales have it that the King Jadhav Rana sent a bowl of milk filled to the brim, implying that he would not be able to accommodate them. The Parsis returned the same bowl of milk with sugar in it to convey that, just as the sugar had seamlessly mixed with the milk, they too would integrate effortlessly.

For centuries, India has assimilated, internalized, accommodated and embraced waves of immigrants, invaders, traders and preachers among others. The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 (CAB), coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) -- a register of all Indian citizens whose creation is mandated by the citizenship act of 1955, subsequently amended in 2003 -- is an assault on India's pluralistic ethos. It is an affront to the first principles of constitutionalism. It violates Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 25 and 26 and the basic structure doctrine now cast in stone in the 1973 Indian Supreme Court case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, which, by a slender majority, mandated that certain articles that form the core of the Constitution are beyond even the amending powers of Parliament.

In a secular nation like India, religion cannot be the basis of citizenship, whether territorial or extra-territorial. It also militates against the first principle of reasonable classification under Article 14 -- equals cannot be treated as unequals. You cannot make religion the determinant for granting refuge, asylum or citizenship.

The act seems to be testing the waters for a pan-India NRC that would make the citizenship of billions subject to the whimsical biases and ideological predilections of those in government today in New Delhi. Moreover, the Citizenship Amendment Act adopts different benchmarks for Bangladesh and Bhutan. The government's defense is that it is meant to protect persecuted minorities in its pan-Islamic neighborhood, specifically, non-Muslim minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

However, Maldives too is Islamic as per Article 10 of its Constitution. Yet, the bill does not extend the same privileges to minorities in the island nation as it does to those of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country, where the Tamil minority (largely Hindu) have long faced persecution at the hands of pro-Sinhalese nationalists. Why does the act exclude them then? What about Ahmadis, Shias, and Baloch in Pakistan? Yes, they're Muslim, but they have been under the shoe of Sunni hardliners, and hardships have been further exacerbated by the military establishment and the constitution in Pakistan that refuses to recognize Ahmadis as Muslims. There is also the case of persecuted Christians in Bhutan.

What would have been more magnanimous on the part of the government would have been comprehensive legislation that is holistic and welcomes all individuals fleeing persecution and not drawing arbitrary lines to gauge persecution based on religious denominations.

There are many shades of grey here and hence we need nuances separating illegal migrants from refugees and granting citizenship on a case-by-case basis in a non-discriminatory manner.

India is in uproar, in protest, in ennui, in disenfranchisement, in pain, in anger, in suffering. If this government cares about its image globally, then it knows that at this rate, it is in trouble. Good governments listen to the pulse of the nation and can diagnose pain points expeditiously. It's one thing for this government to have won an election decisively but today it's ability to govern is seriously in question.

India has stood the test of democracy, when all others around it became tin pot dictatorships run by the military.

The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.Ã¢ÂÂs Digital Henchman,"The companies say they market only to governments to fight terrorism and crime and follow strict protocols to ensure the correct use of their products. But critics argue that commercial spyware has been a boon for authoritarian rulers, who use it to spy on citizens, journalists, political rivals and nonviolent dissidents. No longer must the authorities deploy secret police to shadow opposition figures or plant bugs in their phones. Now they dispatch links via text message that can put them inside peopleÃ¢ÂÂs devices, allowing them to see contacts, read chats and eavesdrop on calls in real time.

The proliferation of hacking technologies has led to a spike in reports of their use across the globe, from Mexico to Ethiopia to Tibet, and they have proven to be especially popular in the Middle East. Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab at the University of TorontoÃ¢ÂÂs Munk School of Global Affairs who tracks commercial spyware, said evidence has emerged of such products being used by Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other countries Ã¢ÂÂ most of them not known for their tolerance of critical views. The lack of outside regulation and the huge sums the companies charge leave the door open for abuse by oppressive states, he said.

Mr. al-QahtaniÃ¢ÂÂs trajectory provides an object lesson in the rise of hacking technologies in an authoritarian state that is also a United States ally. Mr. al-Qahtani earned a law degree and a masterÃ¢ÂÂs degree in criminal justice before joining the royal court as a media monitor in 2008 under King Abdullah.

The next year, he appeared on Hack Forums, an online space for aspiring hackers and cybercriminals Ã¢ÂÂ and he was almost immediately hacked. He bought malware from another user and soon realized it had infected his computer. He was shocked that a hacker had hacked him.

Ã¢ÂÂi think he is a very good man and look trusted!!!Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote.

He was tricked at least three more times by the hackers whose services he sought, and three times acknowledged posting while drunk, according to a report on his online footprint by the research group Bellingcat.

Ã¢ÂÂim on party and drunk and now im really happy,Ã¢ÂÂ he wrote. Ã¢ÂÂwill go to drink tackila and dance lol.Ã¢ÂÂ

Over his six years on the forum, he made hundreds of posts and donated more than $10,000 to the site, while often inquiring about surveillance technologies, offering high sums for simple services and requesting help with specific targets.",human
AT&T tells employees to work from home,"New York (CNN Business) Wireless giant AT&T (T), the owner of CNN, is directing employees to work from home if they can, joining some of the country's other biggest employers in action against the coronavirus pandemic.

Employees who work in AT&T stores, install equipment for customers, and broadcast live on CNN are not affected. But many tens of thousands of other employees are subject to the new guidance, which was released on Friday.

""I realize that many of you are directly serving and interacting with our customers and that work can't be done from home,"" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said in a message to employees. ""What you do is vital to a highly connected society like ours. And it is even more critical in times like these. So, we will be taking additional safeguards and implementing new procedures and policies to help protect you from the virus.""

AT&T has more than 245,000 employees across all of its divisions, and it is unclear how many will work remotely . But the guidance is similar to what other major companies like Google and Amazon have said: stay home if you can.

One of AT&T's divisions is WarnerMedia, which includes CNN, HBO, TNT, TBS, Warner Bros and numerous other media brands.

Online sales of hand sanitizer and other 'virus protectors' spiked over 800% this year in the US,"New York (CNN Business) American shoppers have been racing to stock up on hand sanitizer and other supplies as the coronavirus outbreak spreads.

Online sales of ""virus protection"" items like hand sanitizers, gloves, masks and anti-bacterial sprays soared 817% in January and February compared to the same period last year, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks sales at 80 of the top 100 online retailers in the United States.

US online shoppers are also buying more drugs and non-perishable items, according to Adobe. In those same months, sales of cold, cough and flu products went up 198%, pain relievers jumped 152%, toilet paper grew 186% and non-perishable goods such as canned goods went up 69%, all compared to the same period last year.

Hand sanitizer sales have been spiking.

Adobe didn't ask consumers why they were buying the products, but the sales period lines up with the acceleration of news surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus. There are now about about 125,000 reported cases globally

Other research firms have reported similar upticks in hand sanitizer sales.",human
Coronavirus test: confusion over availability and criteria is leaving sick people wondering if they're infected,"(CNN) A group of first responders in Washington state, a scientist in California, a woman at an assisted living facility in Florida -- all worried because they believe they might have novel coronavirus but say they can't get tested.

They and many others tell CNN they're suffering symptoms associated with what's officially known as Covid-19, and are worried they may have come into contact with someone who has the virus. They are angry and frustrated after trying to get tested, only to be turned away. Their stories came into CNN's tip line even as Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday told CNN's morning show, ""New Day,"" that anyone with a doctor's order could get tested.

""There's no barrier ..."" Pence said. ""Make no mistake about it, we're making steady progress.""

Anxiety and confusion over the availability and criteria for testing were dominant themes Thursday as the nation continued to grapple with the pandemic.

A primary care doctor in Massachusetts said Pence's assertion that anyone with doctor's orders for testing can get it is ""totally false.""

Doctor describes ""insanity"" of coronavirus testing

Aside from critically ill patients who are hospitalized, the physician said the Massachusetts Department of Public Health is only approving testing for people who have been exposed to someone who has already tested positive or who has traveled to one of the five heavily impacted countries outside the US in the past 14 days, which mirrors CDC guidelines.

""It's insanity,"" said the physician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

There are not even tests on hand to use if a patient was approved for testing, the doctor said.

""Even if the patient were around and exposed to someone coughing, sick, sneezing, I cannot give them a coronavirus test,"" the doctor said. ""We are being crippled by our department of public health and the CDC on our ability to combat this pandemic.""

The doctor said state and federal health officials ""need to loosen the criteria on testing"" and ""allow us doctors to use our discretion to decide who should be tested.""

As of Wednesday only 11,079 specimens had been tested in the US, paling in comparison to the more than 230,000 people tested in South Korea, which has about one sixth the US population.

As of 10 a.m. Thursday, there were 81 public health labs that are verified and offering testing for coronavirus, including at least one in all 50 states and Washington, DC, said Michelle Forman, a spokesperson for the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Forman said her association estimates the nation's public labs could run up to 10,000 tests a day.

A big jump in testing is needed to get through crisis, experts say

Infectious disease experts say more testing is critical to prevent the spread of the disease.

Dr. Rod Hochman, CEO of Providence St. Joseph Health, an organization of 51 hospitals and about 1,000 clinics, described testing capacity in the US as highly deficient.

""We're still not at levels where we need to be. This has been really slow to get started,"" said Hochman, who said his organization is currently relying on public lab testing but added that he's been in close contact with commercial diagnostic companies, which he believes will begin testing soon.

Hochman said the turnaround time on testing results has ranged from 24 hours to four days, which he called ""unacceptable.""

""Testing is so critically important because it helps us as clinicians figure out the extent of the spread. It has implications for how we care for patients and where we put them,"" Hochman said. ""It's unraveling the detective story of how the virus spreads but we are trying to do it now with no data.""

If cases of the disease are not identified quickly and community spread continues unchecked, it could soon overwhelm the nation's medical system, just as it did in Wuhan, China, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.

""Now, we're at the critical point where we have to have a big jump in testing and then quarantining and isolating individuals,"" in order to slow the spread of the virus, he said.

But the reality for many Americans is that they are asking for tests and being turned away.

Anger, frustration, fear: Patients describe testing rejection

Hilal Bayrak of Santa Clara, California, was among those who said he couldn't get the peace-of-mind a test might bring. He came down with a 104 degree fever and started coughing and wheezing about a week ago. He had been working alongside a co-worker who had just returned from Italy. The two shared a keyboard, he said.

His 4-year-old daughter first developed a fever and then a few days later, he and his wife came down with one. Last Saturday, they all went to the emergency room. Each tested negative for flu. Their chests were X-rayed. Same thing -- nothing alarming. Bayrak asked if they could be tested for coronavirus and he says was told that was impossible.

In order to be prioritized for testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that one must have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing as well as have been in close contact with a person known to have coronavirus. Or, they had to ""have a history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of their symptom onset.""

Bayrak appealed to ER workers, telling them about his co-worker's recent visit to Italy, a country that has all but shut down while authorities attempt to contain the fast-spreading virus.

It didn't work.

""I was angry. I was frustrated,"" he said. ""What's more surprising is that after we left the ER on Saturday they told me to follow up with them if my symptoms got worse. They did. My fever was persistent. I took Motrin, Tylenol every 4 hours. I started having continuous headaches. I had no energy. At the moment, I have a rash on my body.""

So the 40-year-old called the ER Wednesday and reported that. ""They told me the same thing. I cannot get tested.""

In Washington state, as many as 18 firefighters and paramedics who believe they were exposed to people who tested positive for the virus cannot themselves get tested because they have shown no signs of illness, several firefighters and public information officers told CNN.

""That's very concerning,"" said Gabe DeBay, a firefighter and paramedic in King County.

Dawn Clements has been sick since March 6. The 49-year-old lives in a Largo, Florida, assisted living facility because she suffers from health problems, including a compromised immune system.

Clements said her daughter, 16, suffered from a 103-degree fever and a burning sensation in her lungs two weeks ago, but tested negative for flu. Clements said she began experiencing similar symptoms after taking care of her daughter, and also got a negative flu test.

She says while her daughter has recovered, she has not. Neither has been able to be tested for coronavirus.

""I was told I didn't meet the criteria because I did not travel out of the United States to one of the countries (with spreading coronavirus). I don't know what virus I have. I'm running a fever and I have chest congestion, and nobody can test us here.""

You need to 'advocate for yourself'

Pinellas County, where Clements resides, is ""prioritizing testing,"" according to the state health department.

""It's a situation where the most likely to have Covid-19 are being prioritized for testing, and those are people who have been travelling overseas to an affected area or in close contact with a known Covid-19 patient,"" said health department spokesman Tom Iovino. ""We have lots of 'worried well' people who are just wanting to be tested. We are following the CDC advice, prioritizing testing.""

In some cases it's not the infected person who wants testing done, but the loved ones around them.

Shelby Koser, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mom from Minnesota, said she's worried about her dad, who suffers from asthma and has been battling a cough and fever. She said her 60-year-old father was diagnosed with bronchitis, but that she's skeptical.

""My dad does not normally get this type of sick,"" she said.

Koser said her father is ""too stubborn"" to ask to be tested for Covid-19, and that she and her mom are worried for his health and that of those around him.

""I've got two young kids,"" Koser said. ""My concern is that the government isn't testing enough people and that a lot of people already have it.""

""You need to be an advocate for yourself,"" she added.

Where testing issues started

The struggle some faced in getting tested in the US contrasts sharply with the experiences of patients elsewhere in the world.

In Australia, where testing is free and easily available, actors Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, learned they had come down with the virus.

Some of the people contacting CNN complained of symptoms and circumstances more severe than the ones publicly shared by the actors and said they were still denied tests.

The ability for public health labs to test for the virus was hindered last month when the CDC announced that some test kits shipped to labs were not working properly. The CDC announced it was remaking parts of them.

Lab directors and workers are upset by what they say is a lack of follow-up information from the CDC, said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He's spoken to lab directors and workers.

""From a morale and readiness perspective, labs were frustrated by the delays and the silence from the CDC,"" he said.

The Centers' rollout of lab testing ""didn't go as quickly and smoothly as we usually see,"" acknowledged Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director in an interview that aired Thursday with CNN's Sanjay Gupta.

She described the effort to get tests to public labs as ""a bit delayed"" but also blamed commercial labs, saying they were ""really slow to take this on and scale up.""

Now, weeks into the crisis, Schuchat said ""the jury's out on what exactly is the best way to roll out testing.""

""I've heard from colleagues in other countries about concern that there was so much testing going on that people with no symptoms and people who were not at risk clogged up the healthcare systems,"" she added.

Asked how easy it would be for someone to get tested who is showing symptoms, Shuchat told Gupta, ""Well I think an important thing is to be connected to the healthcare system to figure out if you need testing. You know, it may not be the best thing to go into a clinic and ask about that. It may be better to call.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was more direct in his remarks to Congress Thursday.

""The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it -- we are not set up for that,"" he said. ""Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not.""",human

Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"Suzanne Nossel is executive director of PEN America. She was formerly executive director of Amnesty International USA and deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations at the State Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) RT -- the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as ""Russia Today,"" frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot , publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.

Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the ""Foreign Agents Registration Act,"" or FARA , a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.

Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.

The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the ""About Us"" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.

News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.

Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, ""The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda.""

In late October Twitter announced that it would ""off-board"" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.

Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.

While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.

In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.

With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.

If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.

In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.

Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.

It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself.",human

How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger,"Written by Neo Maditla, CNN

For Niger-born architect Mariam Kamara, the 2018 Rolex Mentor and ProtÃÂ©gÃÂ© Arts Initiative presented her with a tremendous opportunity. The two-year program, which pairs emerging creative talents with masters in their field, saw her working under the guidance of British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye, and allowed her to realize her dream of designing an arts center in Niger's capital city, Niamey. But it also exposed her to her most formidable and outspoken critics yet: a group of high school students.

Though the West African country has one of the youngest populations in the world, literacy rates are low, so Kamara, who founded sustainable design practice Atelier Masomi in 2014, felt it was necessary to create a center that responded to their needs.

""What I had the privilege to do is to really allow (the students) to guide what this project becomes,"" she said over the phone. ""So before Rolex even saw a glimpse of it, I went through the much scarier task of showing it to them. I was nervous because I wanted to make sure that the things we talked about found their way into the design.""

The students told her they wanted a place to read and participate in the arts that reflect their identities as Nigeriens, while also looking to their future. To meet that request, Kamara unveiled her plans for an arts center that also houses an auditorium, a gallery and the city's first public library last year. Once completed (construction begins this summer), the Niamey Cultural Center will be a place for learning, creativity and community-building.

Like her previous projects in the city, the cultural center will be built using compressed earth bricks -- a breathable material responsive to Niger's desert climate and a reflection of local vernacular architecture. The design encompasses four 155-foot curved towers that not only help to cool the interior of the main building by creating facilitating natural ventilation, but also create shaded public courtyards and passages that are accessible to all.

""I know there are people who may not feel that they can enter this large structure because it's very intimidating. So I asked what it means to create space for everyone,"" she said. ""My answer is that it can't be just one big building... I am interested in a structure where you can have a promenade that allows you to be in the space without having to go in.""

The center's location along a valley -- between the French colonial part of the city where the wealthy reside and the side where the less well-off live -- is also significant. Kamara hopes the center will encourage disparate societal groups to come together.

Kamara left Niger to attend university in the United States in 1997. Originally qualifying as a computer scientist, in her 30s she decide to follow her passion for architecture and retrain at the University of Washington.

Though Kamara now splits her time between Niger and Providence, Rhode Island, it's her projects in her home country, blending contemporary and traditional influences, that have earned her the most acclaim and accolades, including the prestigious Prince Claus Award last year.

Her design for a market in the remote village of Dandaji, which includes colorful recycled metal canopies surrounding a sacred tree, has become a vital space for vendors in the region to do trade. And Hikma, the religious and secular complex she designed for the same village in 2018, saw Kamara transforming a derelict Hausa mosque into a library with the help of the adobe masons who originally built it, and created a new, larger mosque alongside it from materials sourced within a three-mile radius. The project was made in collaboration with Iranian architect Yasaman Esmaili, with whom she co-founded the global collective united4design in 2013. The two also co-designed the Niamey 2000 low-cost residential project in 2016.

Kamara said the limitations of working in a country with so few resources has forced her to hone her approach. ""There is something very useful about that scarcity. It clarifies your thinking. It really makes it about space rather than bells and whistles.""

""You cannot hide a bad space when you don't have access to shiny things,"" she continued. ""It becomes more about what the space is doing and how it is bringing people together. That for me is what architecture is about.""

She feels this is especially important at a time when construction has become a significant contributor to pollution in large cities. ""It's impossible to ignore all the climate-related issues,"" she said. ""We need to figure out what progress looks like when it's not fed by exploitation, and recognize our mistakes in terms of construction, material and resource-depletion. Now Asia, South America and Africa can be trailblazers. For me that means there is an opportunity to make a real contribution.""",human
Crawling in a 'polio-free' country,"Story highlights In March of last year, it was announced that polio had been eradicated in India

Photographer Elena del Estal couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the disease

(CNN) Imagine sitting on a dusty, busy street in New Delhi, crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market. A woman's lapis-colored sari swishes past you in the golden-colored dusk. You've been here since morning.

A tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill. You try to lift your hand to accept, but you can't. The muscles are paralyzed, and your mind can't command them to move. You use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee. Then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day.

This is everyday life for Bipin Kumar. Kumar, known as BK, contracted polio as a child, and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives. Kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him, so he moved to New Delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could -- begging on the streets.

Photographer Elena del Estal was in India last year when the World Health Organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country. It had been exactly three years since the last contracted case. Del Estal was fascinated by this. She couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the crippling effects of this horrible disease.

How to prepare for ex-President Trump,"Joshua A. Geltzer is executive director and visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a fellow at New America. He previously was senior director for counterterrorism and deputy legal adviser at the National Security Council. The views expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion articles at CNN.

(CNN) Someday, Donald Trump will become ex-President Trump. After a guilty plea from his longtime ""fixer,"" Michael Cohen, alleging that Trump directed the commission of federal crimes, perhaps that day will arrive sooner rather than later. But whether it's a week, 18 months or more than six years away, we need to start preparing now. That's because, for all of the threat to our democracy Trump poses as president, he may pose an even bigger one as an ex-president.

No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he'll resign. Maybe he'll be impeached. Maybe he'll be voted out in November 2020 -- or maybe he'll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.

But, however he becomes an ex-president, it's impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon's post-presidency footsteps -- ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.

Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused , even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that's careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there's been one constant: a thirst for more attention.

So imagine ex-President Trump tweeting out real-time commentary on every move his successor makes. Imagine him continuing to fire up crowds at the campaign-style rallies he hasn't stopped doing even as a sitting president. Imagine him starting his own news media empire -- just as he apparently planned to do if he lost in 2016. He will be loud.

And he will be dangerous. Already, Trump is casting doubt on the validity of the upcoming midterm elections, suggesting that Moscow is intervening to favor the Democrats and predicting violence if Democrats reverse Republican gains. Already, Trump is indulging the voices of white supremacism and paranoia, finding moral equivalence ""on both sides"" in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, and criticizing tech companies for removing the hate-filled conspiracy theories of Alex Jones and his Infowars. Already, Trump is baselessly attacking other presidents, accusing Barack Obama of surveilling him and planting a spy in his campaign.

Now imagine what Trump will be without White House advisers surrounding him and at least trying to rein him in. Imagine how he might cast doubt on election results, especially ones that have landed him out of office. Imagine how he might seek to rally support wherever he can find it, even among the most extreme voices in our society. Imagine what he might accuse a successor of doing -- especially one who's just beaten him -- given what Trump has said about a predecessor against whom he didn't even run and who went out of his way to be cordial in the transition between them.

And think about Trump's supporters. For many who felt that they didn't have a voice in Washington, Trump was, at last, that voice. They won't want that voice to go silent. That's particularly true if they feel that, just as Trump told them , the system proves ""rigged."" They'll surely feel that way if Trump's impeached or effectively forced to resign. But, even if he's voted out -- or even if he serves for eight years but claims to have been hamstrung for much of it by a purported ""witch hunt"" led by special counsel Robert Mueller -- Trump's supporters will feel that they and he never really got a fair shake. And, as he always does, Trump will indulge that view -- indeed, he'll stoke it.

Our nation's thought leaders need to develop and agree to principles now to mitigate the looming threat posed by ex-President Trump. One might apply to the next president, whether Democratic or Republican: Simply do not engage with ex-President Trump, no matter how vicious his attacks become; isolate him by ignoring him.

Another might govern both sides of the aisle in Congress: Speak up loudly for the norm of ex-presidents treating their successors -- and the office itself -- with respect, even if they disagree with particular policies. And a third might guide the media: Make a pact (whether or not the likes of Breitbart and Fox News agree to it) not to give ex-President Trump more than perfunctory coverage, whatever invective he hurls and however the public remains fascinated by his norm-shattering behavior.

From the White House to the Capitol to the media, the dangers posed by ex-President Trump put a premium on electing leaders and supporting commentators who can make a compelling -- even passionate -- case for why fundamental norms of American governance and political dialogue need to be restored and protected.

There will, of course, be more to Trump's post-presidency than the man himself: He has introduced ideas that will not simply vanish when he leaves the White House. Some of those ideas concern how presidents (and even presidential candidates) communicate, such as by interrupting and talking over debate opponents as well as by using language -- like Trump's reference to ""s**thole countries"" -- previously unacceptable in mainstream politics or even society.

Some of those ideas relate to particular policies, from Trump's brand of economic nationalism to his insistence that immigration is predominantly a liability for the United States, its security and its identity. No matter how Trump leaves office, those ideas have now been normalized in ways that defy instant reversal. They will need to be addressed by deliberate norm-restoring behavior by future presidents and by the articulation of superior policies by politicians able to make those policies resonate with the public.

Whatever traction Trump's ideas have, Trump himself will surely cling to the spotlight -- if he can. We were, as a nation, largely blindsided by the assault on longstanding norms that Trump has personified. That's allowed a lot of damage to be done that we'll spend decades repairing. We can't afford to be blindsided, yet again, by the potential for ex-President Trump to shatter more norms and continue to shake the foundations of our democracy. That's what those ousted from power do in banana republics. Let's get the principles in place to ensure it doesn't happen here.",human
TV shows to help you find your happy place right now,"(CNN) Having already admitted that I'm the type of person who prefers to feed my anxiety, I respect those who desire escapism from their television.

True story: I still haven't finished watching the Japan edition of ""Queer Eye"" because I'm trying to make it last since I don't know how long it's going to be until I get a brand new season. When you find something that's pure goodness, you don't want to waste it.

Why watch it? Henny, why not?

""Modern Family""

'Modern Family'

With this acclaimed ABC comedy coming to an end this year, I've been feeling nostalgic and started watching old episodes. It holds up beautifully.

Why watch it? If you, like me, fell off the ""Modern Family"" wagon a few seasons back, it's the perfect time to revisit this lovely family while staying in with yours.

""Gentefied""

'Gentefied'

A write-in submission from CNN Entertainment Editor Megan Thomas: ""This show is a deliciously fresh dramedy about a multi-generational family working to reinvigorate their Boyle Heights taco shop. It explores themes of gentrification, cultural identity, love and loss with a nuanced lens and a humorous, full heart. Created by Marvin Lemus and Linda Yvette ChÃÂ¡vez, with America Ferrera among the show's producers, the 10-episode first season left me asking for seconds.""

Why watch it? 'Gentefied' will leave you satisfied.

""RuPaul's Drag Race""

'RuPaul's Drag Race'

Another write-in submission. This one comes from CNN Digital's SEO manager Philip Ross:

""What happens when you mix a sewing challenge, a runway, a lip-sync battle and a whole lot of sequins together? You get 'RuPaul's Drag Race,' a reality competition show that pits drag queens from across the US (and occasionally from overseas) against one another in a test of 'charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent.' RuPaul hosts the competition, now in its 12th season, alongside his 'best squirrel friend' Michelle Visage and a slew of celebrity guest judges. The show will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and if you find yourself questioning society's standards of gender expression in the process, then that's the bow on this 3-foot-tall wig.""

Why watch it? ""Because drag queens are hilarious. And that's the tea, sis,"" Ross adds.",human
Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters,"Areva Martin is a CNN legal analyst, a civil rights attorney and St. Louis native. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Many of us vividly recall the hotly contested 2016 primary race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, whom I strongly supported. Sanders' message of fighting income inequality and pushing for Medicare for all resonated with many Democratic voters, as it does now, and after winning the New Hampshire primary he seemed to have momentum on his side. But the race inevitably shifted to the South and its heavy contingent of black voters.

Clinton benefited from her husband's popularity with black voters and pulverized Sanders in South Carolina by 47 percentage points. Sanders next got crushed on Super Tuesday, losing the southern and southwest states of Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Texas.

In 2020, Sanders was determined to avoid repeating that history.

He tried to increase his percentage of the black vote by blanketing Facebook with ads that highlighted his long-standing commitment to civil rights. He also talked up issues of paramount importance to the black community -- criminal justice reform and social-economic injustice. Sanders enlisted the help of influential black surrogates such as Harvard Professor Cornel West and rapper Killer Mike . He began airing a TV ad that features former President Barack Obama's past praise of him, even though he has positioned himself as the anti-establishment candidate. Former Obama aides like David Axelrod questioned the ad given that Sanders and the former President were not particularly close. In Mississippi , his campaign funded an ad campaign on black radio.

But despite all this, Sanders once again failed miserably with black voters. He got crushed, again, in South Carolina and then suffered a blowout loss on Super Tuesday.

And Tuesday night, he suffered perhaps a fatal blow by losing the three Ms -- Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan.

So, what did Sanders do wrong this time? Well, it didn't help that on the Sunday before Super Tuesday he failed to appear at a Bloody Sunday ceremonial event in Selma , Alabama, that honors the civil rights leaders who marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

Sanders compounded that mistake by canceling a rally in Mississippi . Perhaps unknown to him is that many African Americans from my hometown of St. Louis hail from the South and have deep ties to blacks in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. Sanders' actions were an affront not just to those southerners, but to blacks in Missouri.

Another crucial mistake by the presidential hopeful was his failure to control the vitriol coming from his ""Bernie Bro"" supporters. One example: After Joe Biden trounced Sanders in South Carolina by garnering 61% of the black vote, one Sanders supporter explained Biden's victory on Twitter, saying, ""People won't say it but the truth is that many voters in SC are low information voters. Which is a nice way to put it.""

Since South Carolina's Democratic electorate is more than 60% African American, the perception is that the Sanders supporter was equating ""low information voters"" to black voters who support Biden.

In fact, exit polling shows that white voters favored Biden to Sanders by a margin of 33% to 23% and that those with advanced degrees preferred Biden over Sanders 51% to 15%.

Sanders' relentless attacks on millionaires and billionaires didn't resonate with a large segment of the black community that takes pride in the successes of black billionaires such as Robert Smith , who paid off the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class at Morehouse College. Sanders doesn't seem to understand that although many African Americans suffer from an economic system stacked against them, we are economically aspirational.

Many African Americans applaud the high achievement and success of billionaires like Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z and Michael Jordan.

But Sanders' biggest mistake, undoubtedly, was his failure to understand the mindset of middle-aged and older African Americans.

For many of these voters, Trump's relentless attempts to dismantle Obamacare and destroy the entire legacy of the first black president -- Barack Obama -- has been an unending nightmare. The unyielding assault and systematic attack on other prominent African American leaders, like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and the dismantling of safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for seniors made removing Trump from office a pivotal issue for many black voters.

Joe Biden is not the perfect candidate. I take issue with many of the votes he cast as a senator and I wish his candidacy resonated more with younger voters. But Biden understands the importance of black voters and he has his pulse on the electorate. He had a regular presence in African American churches and gained the support of 100 black faith leaders in South Carolina leading up to the state's primary.

Many African Americans feel his concern for the problems plaguing our community is genuine, which is why he has scored overwhelming victories over Sanders in every state with a sizable number of black voters.

Why we can't find hand sanitizer,"Ford Vox is a physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine and a journalist who contributes frequently to CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Alcohol has many uses in a time of pandemic. One of them even comes recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 60% or higher alcohol by volume hand sanitizer (70% for cleaning surfaces) can help. Under the threat of coronavirus, just about any form of hand sanitizer or hand wipes are in short supply. Price gouging has begun in some quarters.

Ford Vox

I work in a hospital, and I prefer hand washing (you should too) but I've started liberally supplementing my daily routines with alcohol-based hand sanitizers as well. I haven't seen a line form yet at these stations dotted throughout the building, but the usage is going up.

In Britain Washington State and Oregon the desperation for the stuff is rising to the level of thievery. Store shelves are empty here in Atlanta.

Washing your hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water is your most important protective measure, both for yourself and your community. Make it a regular and frequent practice throughout the day.

But we can't carry a faucet with us , and that's where the alcohol comes in. Alcohol destabilizes the outer layers of coronaviruses, potentially damaging and breaking them down enough so that they're less likely to infect you when you later rub your eye (you know you want to).",human
Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination,"GarzÃÂ³n, Uruguay (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Terraced vines and spindly olive trees form a patchwork quilt over gently rolling hills, which are themselves covered by a maze of powdery dirt roads. Follow one of these bumpy paths far enough and you'll find an olive oil mill, a farm-to-table restaurant and a hilltop winery.

In fact, if you squint a bit, this place could pass for the famed Italian wine region of Tuscany -- that is, if you can overlook the wild capybaras (the world's largest rodents) and ostrich-like rheas running through the vines. These creatures, of course, are telltale signs you're in a totally different hemisphere on a completely different continent: South America.

It's not that South American wines aren't well known. When experts in California, France or Italy discuss fine wines from South America they typically reference two countries: Chile and Argentina.

Chile revived the lost French grape of CarmÃÂ©nÃÂ¨re and with it, fashioned Bordeaux blends that now rival those from the Old World. Meanwhile, Argentina spearheaded a global craze for Malbec that gave the varietal a permanent home on wine shelves the planet over.

Yet, there's another player that's slowly built up momentum in recent years, thanks, in no small part, to a pioneering new winery that's experimenting with grape varietals and dismantling regional stereotypes.

The country is Uruguay, and the winery is Bodega GarzÃÂ³n

This really is wine country

GarzÃÂ³n lies inland from the fashionable beach town of JosÃÂ© Ignacio, about three hours east of the capital Montevideo. The vines here are barely a decade old, but that hasn't stopped GarzÃÂ³n from racking up an impressive list of accolades.

Suddenly, the world is beginning to give South America's neglected stepchild a closer look.

Uruguay has a 150-year-long history of winemaking, but it's always struggled to get the kind of attention that its neighbors have received for decades.

Size may play a part. South America's second-smallest nation has historically had a wine industry that's slight in scale, miniscule in exports and iffy on quality.

Bodega GarzÃÂ³n is out to change that -- but it hasn't always been easy.

It's on South America's Atlantic Coast

Christian Wylie, the winery's managing director, says one of the biggest hurdles is its location: Many consumers don't even know where Uruguay is. (Hint: it's between Argentina and Brazil on South America's Atlantic Coast.)

""When we have tastings of GarzÃÂ³n wine around the world, one of the first things we do is show them a map,"" he says. ""We explain that Uruguay is at the same latitude as wine regions in Chile, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.""

In other words, the conditions are there to make great wine.

What makes Bodega GarzÃÂ³n so different from nearly every other winery in its own country is that it's located just 11 miles (18 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean.

Not only that, it's in an area that was, historically, little more than pasture for cows. (Uruguayans eat more beef, per capita, than any other country on Earth. Take that Argentina.)

Owner Alejandro Bulgheroni, a billionaire businessman from Argentina, planned to use this land for a wind farm thanks to its cool Atlantic breezes. His wife, Bettina, was concerned about the aesthetics (they have a house nearby) and convinced him to try grapes instead.

Local ocean-influenced wines

That's why Bulgheroni hired the renowned Italian oenologist Alberto Antonini to survey the rolling granitic hills and assess if they might be suitable for vines.

Just over a decade later, the pair has almost single-handedly created a 524-acre wine region while inspiring a local movement in ocean-influenced wines.

Uruguay has about 22,250 acres (about 9,000 hectares) under vine.

Most vineyards face the River Plate in Canelones Department, ""but I don't believe that's the best location,"" says Antonini. ""It's just the closest to Montevideo, where the first European immigrants arrived.""

In GarzÃÂ³n, Antonini and Bulgheroni believe they've stumbled across a new frontier for South American wines.

And Bulgheroni still figured out a way to use wind power.

Making wine the green way

Although his renewable energy project here might never have materialized, he's helped turn this place into the first winery in the world to achieve LEED silver certification for its entire facility, in part, thanks to the way it harnesses wind power. (Developed by the non-profit US Green Building Council, LEED assesses the potential environmental impacts and human benefits of a project.)

The winery's sustainable design includes headline-making features such as the largest green roof with native species in Latin America. The structure, conceived by Mendoza-based architecture firm BÃÂ³rmida & YanzÃÂ³n, was also built into hills and over natural terraces to utilize a gravity flow system for the production of its wines.

Though the winery itself didn't open until 2016, it now lures 20,000 visitors a year to the tiny town of Pueblo GarzÃÂ³n (population 200).

Most come for tours that dip underground into caves filled with barrels, steel tanks and concrete ""eggs"" (the ovular cement tanks that are suddenly all the rage with winemakers). You can also skirt past the abstract sculptural pieces of Uruguayan artist Pablo Atchugarry to tour the production line, which is capable of turning out 200,000 cases annually (though current production is around 110,000 cases).

A posh private club, commercial olive oil mill and 120-seat restaurant led by celebrity chef Francis Mallmann (whose primal technique of open-fire cooking featured on the Netflix series ""Chef's Table"") keep visitors lingering far longer than they might expect.

Part of Bodega GarzÃÂ³n's success in producing fine wine has been selecting varietals that will grow well in Uruguay's hot and humid climate.

Tannat, a highly tannic red wine varietal from the south of France, was already Uruguay's signature grape long before GarzÃÂ³n arrived on the scene. It was a given.

However, the Galician white wine varietal of AlbariÃÂ±o has proved to be one of GarzÃÂ³n's biggest surprises, winning awards for its freshness, minerality and round finish. The winery also gives the Bordeaux blending grape Cabernet Franc a starring turn as a single varietal, highlighting its soft tannins and peppery punch.

The icon wine, Balasto, is a blend of Tannat, Cabernet Frac, Merlot and Marselan. Its name is an homage to the weathered granite found in the soil at GarzÃÂ³n, which allows for drainage during the area's wetter months and keeps the wines here lively, rather than heavy.

Balasto spends 20 months in untoasted French oak barrels and retails for around $100 in the US, reaching a price point few Uruguayan wines could demand a decade ago. It is, perhaps, the most obvious sign that Uruguay has finally broken-down historic barriers that have kept it from becoming a major player in the wine world.",human
How non-alcoholic cocktails are shaking up the bar scene,"London (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Up until relatively recently, non-alcoholic cocktails seemed like merely an afterthought for most bars.

As a result, teetotalers were often left with little choice but to guzzle juice, soda or water all night.

Those booze-free cocktails that did feature on drinks menus tended to be made up of popular cocktails minus the alcohol, which often left those buying them feeling shortchanged.

But the demand for non-alcoholic drinks has risen rapidly since then, as has the amount of high quality low and zero proof alcohol products available.

Now it seems mixologists are finally devoting as much time and effort into creating booze-free cocktails as alcoholic ones.

The spirit is usually replaced with something like Seedlip, a non-alcoholic botanical spirit, or Everleaf, an alcohol-free aperitif drink, although some bars have gone as far as to make their own hydrosols, or ""flower waters,"" using a rotovap, a device used for distilling.

Hamish Smith, Bars Editor of Drinks International , a revered global drinks journal, says this is a much welcome change.

""[It's] not an apologetic few lines at the back,"" says Smith. ""We're talking crafted cocktails that just so happen to not contain alcohol.""

Burgeoning market

Will Meredith, head bartender at Lyaness, says non-alcoholic cocktails are better than ever nowadays. CNN

The success of Dry January, which encourages participants to forgo alcohol for the first month of the year, has also had an impact -- 21% of US drinkers took part last year according to market research firm Nielsen.

Unsurprisingly, non-alcoholic cocktail sales are usually at their highest during this time, which means bars are having to up their game to ensure they can attract and cater for every type of customer.

""I definitely think we're moving away from a world where syrup topped up with a soft drink constitutes a non-alcoholic cocktail,"" says Will Meredith, head bartender for Lyaness, a popular London cocktail bar.

At Lyaness, the reincarnation of World's Best Bar 2018 winner Dandelyan, the commitment to non-alcoholic cocktails is clear.

When dreaming up their drinks menu, the team went to great pains to ensure there was a booze-free version of as many cocktails as possible.

""Non-alcoholic drinks are massively important to us. It's something we've always put a lot of love and time into,"" adds Meredith.

""Consumers who come into this bar, come for the whole experience. The experience isn't [and shouldn't be] dependent on what they're consuming.""

While the numbers vary from country to country, alcohol consumption is declining globally on the whole.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a nearly 5% point decrease, from 47.6% to 43%, in the number of drinkers across the world since 2000.

Inclusivity factor

Although there doesn't seem to be a definitive explanation for this -- health consciousness is thought to among the contributing factors -- it's clear there's been a shift in attitudes towards alcohol.

According to Meredith, the customers who opt for non-alcoholic cocktails at Lyaness range from bankers to new mothers, while some choose to switch between booze-free cocktails and alcoholic ones.

""Non-alcoholic serves aren't anything new, but what is new is that they are taken seriously -- by bartenders and their customers,"" says Smith.

""Millennials and (drinking age) Generation Zs are drinking less, but don't want to be left out -- they want to experience cocktail bars in the same way drinkers do.

""The bar world has reacted -- it has to. After all, bartenders' raw material is liquid -- it doesn't always have to be alcoholic.""

The cocktails at Lyaness consist of seven core ingredients -- infinite banana, purple pineapple, king monkey nut, ONYX, aromatized milk wine, old fashioned whiskey and ultra raspberry.

Related content This bar got famous not serving alcohol

Meredith says the mixologists always have a non-alcoholic version in mind when choosing a base spirit to compliment the main ingredient, and will keep looking for a suitable booze-free option until they've exhausted all avenues.

He makes a point of referring to the drinks as non-alcoholic cocktails rather than ""mocktails,"" as they're often called, explaining the label has negative connotations.

""The word 'mock' in itself means a bit of a lighthearted joke,"" Meredith points out.

Of the 20-plus cocktails on the menu here, there are seven non-alcoholic versions.

Among the most popular is Tattie Milk Punch, made up of vegan honey, ""potato cream"" and Aecorn (a non-alcoholic aperitif) and Seedlip Spice.

Pina Leaf High Ball, consisting of purple pineapple, gooseberry, salted pineapple leaf, soda and Seedlip Grove is also a favorite.

Costly experience?

The non-alcoholic version of the Pina Leaf High Ball is one of the most popular boozeless cocktails. CNN

One of the most surprising elements about the rise in non-alcoholic cocktails is the amount customers are prepared to pay for them -- although some may argue waking up without a hangover after a night out drinking is utterly priceless.

A standard cocktail at Lyaness, costs between ÃÂ£10 to ÃÂ£15 ($13 to $19) while a non-alcoholic cocktail is priced at around ÃÂ£7 (around $10).

Although the booze-free versions are significantly cheaper, $10 still feels like a sizable amount for a non-alcoholic drink.

So why are customers seemingly happy to splash the cash?

""I think the driving force has been this transition away from putting the value of a drink on the alcoholic content,"" says Meredith, stressing that bartenders have to put a lot of effort into crafting great tasting non-alcoholic cocktails ""without the luxury of booze.""

He also emphasizes Lyaness' non-alcoholic cocktails are made with high end products such as vegan honey and homemade cordials, which are factors in the total cost.

""Non-alcoholic cocktails are becoming so much more in depth, intricate and balanced than they've ever been,"" he adds.

""So the people who weren't drinking [before] now finally see something of value they can consume, and they're willing to pay the money that's required to enjoy it.""

The ever-growing number of non-alcohol products entering the drinks market has allowed bars like Lyaness to be even more creative with its non-alcoholic additions.

These include Stryyk, a non-alcoholic rum made of cane sugar, vanilla and oak and CaleÃÂ±o, a distilled spirit with botanicals, as well as Seedlip and Everclear.

And with more and more similar products launching every year, as well as the emergence of new alcohol-free bars such as New York's Getaway bar and Redemption Bar in London, it's likely demand will continue to grow.

""There are a lot of people who are doing amazing things in the non-alcoholic industry at the moment,"" says Meredith.

""As long as we put our foot on the gas and don't let up, it's only going to get better.""

In fact, the non-alcoholic beverage market is expected to reach a record value of $1,650.28 billion globally by 2024, according to a report by Zion Market Research

""This isn't a trend,"" says Smith. ""It's how things will be from now on in.""",human
"Coronavirus threat to Tokyo 2020 is 'heartbreaking,' says surfer Kanoa Igarashi","(CNN) It is less than 150 days until Tokyo 2020's opening ceremony and as the landmark approaches there is mounting speculation on how and whether the Olympics will be affected by the growing coronavirus threat.

(CNN) ""We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus ... I will always put the well-being of America first."" After weeks of downplaying the outbreak, US President Donald Trump addressed the nation last night, announcing a suspension of travel from Europe and emergency action to help Americans affected by the virus.

Yet the speech -- in which he described the disease as a ""foreign virus"" and blamed Europe for its spread to the US -- brought more confusion to an already rattled nation. Trump's administration was later forced to clarify that the ban would apply to ""people, not goods,"" and only to foreign nationals, not Americans who had been screened before entering the country.

But as infections in the US soar past 1,200 , communal spread appears to be more of a threat than foreign transmission. States are demanding more test kits amid a continued shortage, begging the question of whether the number of reported cases reflects the reality of the crisis.

Trump spoke to the nation at a fearful moment, Stephen Collinson writes . Schools across the country are closing, the NBA basketball league has been suspended, and hospitals are on high alert.

Around the same time Trump was speaking, actor Tom Hanks , known affectionately as ""America's dad,"" announced in an Instagram post from Australia that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the disease.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Airlines and passengers scrambling

""If the leader of the free world is telling you that, you know, your travel is being affected, I would think that we have to give you your money back."" That was the advice of an airline worker at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to passengers waiting to board a flight to Dublin moments after Trump announced his new travel ban. Airlines are scrambling to understand and implement the restrictions, as travelers race back to the US before the deadline or weigh canceling trips, Madeline Holcombe writes

The 30-day ban, which starts at 11:59 p.m. Friday, applies to 26 European countries; it doesn't apply to the UK, despite a spike in cases there. Americans and US permanent residents will still be allowed to fly to Europe and return to the US, but will be screened upon re-entry and face quarantine or restrictions on movement for 14 days. It's not clear whether airlines will still fly the routes if passenger demand from European nationals dries up.

In a strongly-worded statement, the European Union said it disapproved of the ban, which was imposed ""without consultation.""

The UK said today that it would not introduce US-style travel bans, but others are. The Czech Republic will enforce controls on its borders with Germany and Austria; India has suspended all visas until April, effectively barring all foreigners from visiting; and Australia has extended its travel ban for Italy, Iran, China and South Korea.

US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""

""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"Written by Aric Chen

Aric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.

Upon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.

As a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery's hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London's Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.

We should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum

But mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as ""low-tech,"" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.

Serpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. The temporary pavilion will be open to the public from May 30 to October 31, 2018. Credit: WF Central

""His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,"" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.

Liu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural ""realism."" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.

Centered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.

But as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them "" Rebirth Bricks "") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.

Shifting attitudes

A stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.

Even the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.

Often small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.

""He's the right architect at the right time,"" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.

According to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of ""junzi,"" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.

""I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,"" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. ""It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.""

Put another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).

Nonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing's inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.

The country's architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come.",human
Dunkin' will give out free donuts every Friday this month,"New York (CNN Business) What's a better counterattack against the savory breakfast items sold by Wendy's and McDonald's? Dunkin' thinks it's something sweet.

Dunkin' is giving away a free classic donut with a purchase of any drink every Friday in March, signaling the latest escalation among fast food rivals for the breakfast battle . Customers have to order through the Dunkin' app or with a linked credit or debit card to access the deal, which is only available in the United States.

Dunkin's rewards program, DD Perks, gives customers points for purchases that can be redeemed for free drinks. It's a focal point for the company this year, which is looking to grow the program because it drives loyalty and return customers.

Mmm, donuts.

Starbucks SBUX DD Perks grew its membership base 38% last year to 13.6 million members, the company revealed in its most earnings call last month. Around 13% of sales were completed in the app. But that pales in comparison to its closest rival,, which has 19 million members and gets around 40% of its sales through its app.

Dunkin' Vice President Stephanie Lilak said in the earnings call the brand will is going to be ""very aggressive"" in growing the membership with new promotions, like Free Donut Friday. It also frequently offers point bonuses on its breakfast items, like its Beyond Sausage Sandwich , to entice people to order through the app.",human
The other gun lobby,"They are, sadly, growing in number: Americans devastated by gun violence. The connections they've forged are strong. But can they defeat the NRA?

Their personal families are shrinking, while their ranks are growing: Families whose loved ones have been killed or wounded by guns.

They vow this time is different. They're no longer a loose patchwork of grass-roots groups that emerge after the latest mass shooting -- only to get outspent by the NRA's war chest, their hopes for ""common sense"" gun measures dashed.

The Loneliest Club They are survivors of gun violence. But they have more than that in common. They share a conviction: to use the worst days of their lives to make America a safer place. READ MORE

This time, they have the backing of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his $50 million donation. They are Everytown for Gun Safety, which in 2014 brought under one umbrella Bloomberg's two previous gun groups, Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.

Their focus is on field operations, to mobilize their 3 million members on this single issue and then get supporters to the polls. They steal tactics from the National Rifle Association and study other groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving that have won victories against massive industries.

They gather in cities around the country to learn how to target policymakers and stay unified. They plan rallies and organize on social media. They circle states where change is most possible. They work with the Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords' organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, on federal legislation. They've found an ally in the White House.

They are the ""other"" gun lobby, unafraid of the NRA and its fervent backers.

Andy Parker took on the NRA after his daughter was killed on live TV.

The most powerful message lies within its survivors' network -- some 800 people who've had a loved one killed or wounded by a gun.

This determined crowd turns the conversation around on the most stridently pro-life conservatives: What are you doing to save the lives of America's children from gun violence?

They make lobbying one click away:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Call your senators and demand a vote on universal background checks

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Send your condolences to those affected by the mass shooting in Oregon

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Join your local Moms Demand Action chapter

Everytown's efforts have already scored some victories. In Washington state, nearly 60% of voters supported mandatory background checks on private gun sales, closing a loophole that advocates say will keep guns from falling into the wrong hands. Oregon voters earlier this year passed a similar measure -- the sixth state to do so since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Everytown is next turning to background check ballot initiatives in Nevada and Maine.

Victories have taken shape in other forms, too.

Just this year, they defeated bills across 23 states that would have either let people carry guns in public schools or college campuses or would have let them carry concealed, loaded handguns in public with no permit and no training. They also defeated attempts to repeal universal background checks for all gun buyers in Colorado, and for all handgun buyers in Iowa and North Carolina.

Reporter Alison Parker and her cameraman were shot to death in August.

Eight states also passed laws to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.

The voices of these mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters have joined forces with the likes of Amy Schumer, Julianne Moore, Yoko Ono, Rosanne Cash and Don Cheadle. Those celebrities have formed an 80-person council to advocate for awareness of gun violence.

There seems to be a renewed urgency like never before -- that enough is enough.

For those within the survivors' group, their message is punctuated by that chilling, awful day when they got the news of a slain loved one. Reliving those memories has become a permanent part of their lives. A message, they say, America must hear.

This time, they won't be silenced. They don't want to ban guns. Many pack heat themselves. They just want to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, the seriously mentally ill and others who may pose a danger. If enacting universal background checks saves just one life, they ask, then isn't it worth it?

And so it is through these bonds of determination they unite. Friendships are formed.

""If we have to outspend the NRA, then that's what we'll do,"" Andy Parker says. ""We have dough behind us.""

Parker was thrust into the spotlight when his daughter, Alison, a TV reporter in Roanoke, Virginia, was killed along with her cameraman, Adam Ward, on live television in August. Ever since, her father has pushed for new measures to reduce gun violence.

Lori Haas has fought for tighter gun laws since the Virginia Tech massacre.

""I have the moral high ground here,"" he says.

But even he's been turned away by some of the nation's political leaders, politicians, he says, who take their ""cues from the NRA [rather] than trying to save lives.""

""They're pro-life, but after you're born all bets are off,"" Parker says. ""It doesn't make you feel really good.""

Parker has been aided in his fight by Lori Haas, who has advocated for changes to America's gun laws since her daughter, Emily, was shot and wounded in the Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 people dead.

Parker reached out to Haas shortly after his daughter was killed when he read a quote of hers about the power of the current movement. ""Our elected leaders will be booted out of office if they don't do something,"" she said.

The two now meet regularly. They stay at each other's homes. They've targeted Virginia lawmakers who they believe are vulnerable in November and are working to get their message out in those districts. They write op-eds. They speak on TV and radio. They share posts over Facebook and Twitter. Anything to spread the word.

""The connection is purposeful, but it's also very, very personal,"" says Haas.

Just this week, Parker and another survivor posed questions on Facebook for the Democratic candidates debating on CNN in Las Vegas.

""As president, will you commit to working towards requiring background checks for ALL gun sales?"" Parker asked. Erica Lafferty Smegielski, whose mother was killed at Sandy Hook, wanted to know what three things the candidates would do as president to keep other families from experiencing her pain.

Emily Haas was shot and wounded during the 2007 attack that killed 32.

""The NRA has a 30-year head start on us, but we're catching up now,"" says Parker. ""That's why I have reason for hope.""

Haas says there was little in the way of support after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. At times, she felt alone in her despair to take on the gun industry. Those days are over: ""We now have a platform.""

""Everything about the movement has just grown and grown and grown,"" she says.

Don't mistake their grief as a pity party. Their determination remains unwavering. Undying.

""We are pissed off and we want to do something about this,"" Parker says.

The war for them starts in their home state of Virginia. They've begun drawing up proposals to strengthen what they say are loose gun measures. They've earned the backing of Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

Winning in the state where the NRA is headquartered, they say, would be monumental.

""The fun is about to start,"" Parker says.

Erica Lafferty Smegielski and Jenna Yuille

Tale of two daughters

Erica Lafferty Smegielski, left, and Jenna Yuille lost their mothers to gun violence.

Their mothers were killed three days apart, in shootings that made national news. Not long after, they both began working to change gun laws.

But it was more than two years before they finally met, during an advocacy training program for survivors in New York.

Participants were gathered for an informal dinner, sitting in a circle and telling their stories. When it was Jenna Yuille's turn, she wept as she spoke.

As she did, Erica Lafferty Smegielski broke down -- ""those big ugly sobs,"" she says, which continued as she hugged Yuille later.

""I didn't know this at the time, but apparently [Erica] was known for being very strong, never crying and just amazingly always holding it together,"" says Yuille.

""I'd never met someone who'd been so impacted in such a similar way,"" says Smegielski. ""It hit too close to home for me.""

Their connection has only grown since then.

""There's a certain drive between us,"" says Yuille. ""We so want to change things for our moms.""

It was December 11, 2012, when Yuille lost her mother to gun violence.

A masked gunman armed with a stolen AR-15 semi-automatic rifle entered a Clackamas, Oregon, mall and fired off more than 60 rounds. Cindy Yuille, a hospice nurse who'd spent her life caring for others, was killed -- along with another man. The shooter then took his own life.

Sandy Hook principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung was killed in the 2012 rampage.

Three days later, on the opposite side of the country, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed six adults and 20 children. Among them was Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the school's principal and Smegielski's mother.

Just that morning, Smegielski had been texting with her mother about her upcoming wedding. They'd picked out the strapless white, long-tiered taffeta gown Smegielski would wear. Now she sent her mother a photo of custom teal-colored Converse sneakers with the words, ""Wedding shoes!""

""You're not going to really wear those, are you?"" her mother typed.

No stranger to her daughter's nontraditional ways, she must have already known the answer. She added a smiley face, one with a wink and a tongue sticking out.

""Yeah. Yeah I am,"" Smegielski, 30, remembers replying. ""I never heard back.""

Seven months later, as Smegielski prepared to walk down the aisle on her wedding day, she rushed off to the nearby cemetery with her grandmother, sister and cousin. She needed a picture with her mother.

Wearing a veil, the dress they'd selected together and those Converse sneakers, she bowed down to kiss her mother's headstone, a moment that was photographed and stays with her always.

""If the closest thing I could get was a piece of granite in the ground, that's what I was going to do,"" Smegielski says.

Yuille, too, treasures an image with her mother.

She holds tight to a photo from her college graduation, taken a year and a half before her mom's death. Around Yuille's neck, and atop her green University of Oregon gown, is a collection of cords, each one representing an honor she'd earned. Her mother stands beside her beaming.

""I miss her every day,"" says Yuille, 26, who works in communications for Nike in Portland. ""I think about how proud she'd be of everything I'm doing.""

Yuille's commitment to reducing gun violence kicked in early. A friend in politics began making connections for her. She testified at hearings. She wrote op-eds and did media interviews. She got involved in statewide elections and helped start Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership. And from the moment she was introduced to Everytown for Gun Safety, she was on board with the cause.

Cindy Yuille was murdered by a gunman who opened fire at an Oregon mall.

Smegielski couldn't return to the job she had before the Newtown shooting. Growing up with a mother who was a special ed teacher, then an administrator, schools had always been her safe place. So she gravitated to that world and worked as a college admissions counselor. After the massacre at Sandy Hook, that sense of safety was gone.

The more involved she got in gun violence issues, her comfort in other places disappeared, too. She won't go to movies and will only rent them. She avoids grocery shopping at all costs. That's what online delivery services are for, if her husband doesn't do it. She's not sure she can bring children into this world -- not just because her mom, who was her best friend, won't meet them but because the staggering statistics of gun violence terrify her.

""I have to make accommodations in my life because people are killed every day,"" Smegielski says. ""It's not a matter of if it will happen again, it's what town will it be? I have too much life left to take chances.""

For two years she's made this cause her profession. Smegielski, who lives in Prospect, Connecticut, is a senior outreach associate for Everytown for Gun Safety. She was in New York training survivor advocates when she and Yuille met.

The commonalities extend beyond losing their mothers to gun violence just days apart and being so close in age. Neither of them had close relationships to fathers or stepfathers. Their mothers were their parents, and their family support systems are small.

Though Yuille has a stepbrother 10 years younger, she was raised an only child. Smegielski has just one sibling, an older sister, who is married with kids. Besides her, her grandmother, her husband and his family, that's it for Smegielski.

They've discussed spending the holidays together. They also think about coming together around the anniversaries of their mothers' deaths so they can celebrate the women who raised them.

They can talk without judgment. They can discuss the merits of antidepressants or anti-anxiety pills without shame. They can lean on each other when new shootings make headlines and, as Yuille puts it, ""It feels like it's happening all over again.""

In spite of the miles that separate them, they vow to be there for each other as life goes on without their mothers.

Lucy McBath and Sharon Risher

The mother and the minister

Lucy McBath, left, reached out to the Rev. Sharon Risher after the Charleston shooting.

She weeps whenever she hears of another shooting, but the news out of Charleston, South Carolina, this summer brought Lucia ""Lucy"" McBath to her knees.

Learning that a gunman's rampage at a Bible study left nine dead made this woman of God crumble.

""I was devastated, as if it had happened to me,"" McBath says. ""I cried myself to sleep.""

The Rev. Sharon Risher was struggling, too. Details were trickling in, but the trauma chaplain was at work in a Dallas hospital, far from the city where she grew up. She had to pull it together to tend to a grieving family before she could focus on her own fears.

She hoped the early reports were wrong and that her momma, Ethel Lance, was OK. Her mother was a faithful member of the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

Calls to Lance's cell phone went unanswered, though, and she understood.

""I knew she was gone because there would have been no other place in the world she would have been,"" says Risher, who also lost two cousins, Susie Jackson and Tywanza Sanders, in the attack.

Risher at her seminary graduation with her mother, Ethel Lance, who was killed in Charleston.

In Atlanta, McBath picked up her pen and got to work. She's a faith and community outreach leader for Everytown for Gun Safety, and writing letters to survivors of gun violence -- including relatives of victims -- is a role she embraces.

She knows the importance because she's been on the other side. In 2012, McBath's only child, 17-year-old Jordan Davis, was shot and killed at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station during a dispute over loud music. She was flooded with cards, emails and Facebook messages -- and she's saved them all.

""That's part of Jordan's legacy,"" she says.

But no one who wrote had suffered as she had. For Risher, she could be that person.

""Nobody can understand what you're feeling and thinking other than someone who's really been through it,"" says McBath, 55. ""I, as a victim, understand completely.""

Risher's mother was the first victim buried after the Charleston shooting. Risher stayed in her hometown for the funeral of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a state senator and Emanuel's pastor. Thousands attended, and President Barack Obama gave the eulogy.

After that, she'd had all she could take of funerals. Back home in Dallas a few days later, she was greeted with a pile of letters and cards, forwarded to her by the Charleston church fondly known as Mother Emanuel. One envelope stuck out because Risher's name was written along the side. Inside she found what she didn't yet know she needed: a two-page handwritten letter with words of sympathy, the story of McBath's own heartache, an outstretched hand in support -- and a personal phone number.

Risher wasn't the only one in need. For McBath, the work she does for Everytown for Gun Safety -- and as a national spokeswoman for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America -- is a source of comfort for herself as well. She's helped promote two documentary films that feature her and her son's stories -- ""3ÃÂ½ minutes, 10 bullets"" and ""The Armor of Light."" She's testified at hearings, spoken at summits, lobbied legislators, created a foundation in her son's name and more.

""We're trying to sort of shove the pain away a bit and work through the pain,"" she says of survivors like herself. ""But then, when I slow down, it comes crashing down on me. ... Two weeks ago, I had a day when I was weeping all day because I missed my boy so much.""

Jordan Davis was killed in Jacksonville, Florida, in a dispute over loud music.

After reading McBath's letter, Risher didn't hesitate. She grabbed her phone and began to dial. That first conversation was more tears than talk.

""She was just pouring out her heart,"" says McBath. ""And I was crying because I hate the fact that she has to go through this.""

In one another, they say they've found a kindred spirit. They relate not just because they've endured similar sorts of shock and pain but because they are both African-American, God-fearing women.

And while race played a part in the shootings that robbed them of loved ones -- in Charleston the gunman wanted ""to start a race war,"" while in Jacksonville the shooter claimed self-defense and reportedly described Davis and his friends as ""thugs"" and ""gangsters"" -- they insist the problem is bigger than that. They want the conversations to be about gun safety, first and foremost.

Risher, 57, is just stepping into the role of activist. She's attended several Everytown for Gun Safety gatherings in Washington and has spoken to media. She thanks God for sending McBath her way. While her own children and others are there for her, McBath offers something no one else can.

""She's been a constant beacon,"" Risher says. ""She's just grabbed me into her bosom and said, 'I'll be here for you spiritually and emotionally, even if I can't be there for you physically.'""

Whether it's quick text messages, phone calls or face-to-face meetings, their connection endures. They've created a safe space for each other. Sometimes they talk about wanting to escape for a girls' weekend, a chance, as McBath puts it, to ""breathe the air outside the tragedy."" Risher imagines someplace warm, where they can ""sit on the beach and drink drinks with umbrellas in them.""

Someday they'll get there, but for now there's too much work to be done.

DeAndra Yates and Diana Alvarado Rodriguez

'From so much pain, there's triumph'

Diana Alvarado Rodriguez, left, was drawn to DeAndra Yates after reading about her son.

DeAndra Yates pounded on the hotel door next to hers. Diana Alvarado Rodriguez, the woman she considers a sister, answered. It was the middle of the night.

""Girl, what's going on?"" Rodriguez said.

""My son!"" Yates cried. ""He's sick and he's been rushed to the hospital.""

Yates had been awakened by a call that took her back to the moment she learned her boy had been shot at a birthday party.

That was more than 1ÃÂ½ years ago. The shooting left Dre a quadriplegic at 13.

Now, the voice on the other end of the line was telling her Dre had suffered two seizures, one lasting 20 minutes.

He needed to be taken from a hospital in Carbondale, Illinois, to a more specialized children's hospital in St. Louis.

His condition was critical.

Yates was hundreds of miles away in Denver, at a conference earlier this month with Rodriguez and other members of the Everytown for Gun Safety Survivor Network.

They had talked about the power of uniting, how to organize and spread their message. How to lean on each other when dark moments strike.

In Rodriguez's hotel room, Yates broke down. Consumed by self-doubt, she wondered: Why did I leave my son's side? How am I going to get back to him?

Dre Yates was shot at a birthday party; the bullet left him a quadriplegic.

Rodriguez immediately swung into action. She rounded up other members of what she calls Team Dre. ""We were able to put to practice what we were being taught,"" Rodriguez says.

Rodriguez knows pain. Her 18-year-old daughter, Samantha Guzman, was shot and killed as she walked home from a party with friends in the Bronx on Mother's Day 2006.

Soon, about six people were gathered in Rodriguez's hotel room. Rodriguez and another woman prayed, while others began booking flights. They weren't going to let Yates fly home by herself. Rodriguez would escort her to the hospital and stay until family arrived.

""I was scared to death. I didn't know what was going to happen to my son,"" Yates says. ""That's the power of the network and the power of the connection that she and I have on a personal level.""

""That was an honor,"" adds Rodriguez. ""It's about being compassionate, about being there for the person when they need you. That's what I wanted: I wanted to be there for her.""

The two women have been constant companions since meeting over Facebook about a year ago. Rodriguez was drawn to Yates after reading posts about caring for her son. A bullet had entered the back of Dre's head and left the former middle school football star using a wheelchair, unable to speak. Success these days is measured by incremental victories, like seeing him smile.

Rodriguez's daughter, Samantha Guzman, was killed walking home from a party.

""It was beautiful -- and it was somebody who had survived. Not too many of our children are surviving this mess that's going on,"" Rodriguez says. ""For me, that was something special because I have always thought: What would've happened if my daughter would have survived?""

When her daughter was killed in 2006, Rodriguez had to figure out how to grieve by herself. There were not many groups for people with loved ones killed by gun violence. Certainly, none reaching out to her at the height of her pain.

She knew the turmoil Yates was suffering. Ever since they connected, they've spoken by phone and texted daily. It's a shared camaraderie that only these families know, a pain so great it reaches into the depth of the soul.

""We share tears and we just talk, you know,"" Rodriguez says.

Yates felt that instant connection, too. When Rodriguez rests her hand on Yates' shoulder, you can see the love the two share. It radiates from their faces. When they speak, they finish each other's sentences. Yates wears a purple and black bracelet for Rodriguez's daughter Samantha. Rodriguez wears a beaded bracelet for Dre.

Just a week before Dre's recent hospitalization, the two shared monumental joy: Dre had walked on a treadmill for the first time since being shot. Now, he was struggling to live.

Yates couldn't have gone through the ordeal without her best friend and the others who support her.

""My son is still struggling with his disabilities, and everyone else has lost their children. People are like: 'Wow, her son is alive, but look at what she's having to go through.' It opens up other survivors' minds -- that this is an everyday battle.

""And for me, I look at them and say, 'I know it's hard for me, but it's even harder for them because they can't even touch or see their child.'""

Rodriguez and Yates vow nothing can break their bond. Don't tell them America's gun laws can't be changed. Because the fact is, Rodriguez says, ""Something's gotta be done. The violence needs to stop.""

But, Yates adds, ""We are learning that something greater is coming out of it. ... From so much pain, we have found triumph.""

Tom Sullivan and Jane Dougherty

'Superman' and the dressmaker

Tom Sullivan ""is our tough guy,"" says Jane Dougherty. ""I'm the heart.""

At home, Jane Dougherty is a mother, wife and bridal dress maker in Littleton, Colorado. But when she talks about the need for tighter gun laws, she speaks as a woman who lost her sister to gun violence.

Mary Sherlach, a school psychologist and Dougherty's older sister, was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut.

Dougherty is often joined in her activism by Tom Sullivan, who lost his son, Alex, in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre five months earlier.

A retired postal worker, Sullivan says he represents the fathers and ""lunch bucket guys"" who try to do everything right and keep their families out of harm's way, only to find that gun violence is random.

Together, they make a formidable pair when they call on Colorado lawmakers to support universal background checks and gun restraining orders for domestic abusers and the mentally ill.

""He's our tough guy. He's the one calling legislators out,"" Dougherty says. ""I'm the heart. I can make legislators cry.""

And they have each other's back.

The two were at the Colorado State Capitol in 2014, waiting outside a committee room to testify, when a man wearing a brown robe emblazoned with gun patches approached Dougherty and started ranting.

""Your sister should've had a gun,"" she remembers him saying. ""If she had a gun she could have shot that guy.""

Alex Sullivan was killed in the Aurora massacre while celebrating his birthday.

Sullivan stepped in and yelled for guards to let Dougherty enter the room and escape the confrontation.

""He was there for me,"" she says. ""He'll always be my Superman.""

Dougherty and Sullivan met at a rally in Denver on the first anniversary of the Aurora shooting. Her sister's death 2,000 miles away inspired Dougherty to work for stricter gun laws in her home state, and Sullivan knew of her activism. They became fast friends, joining Facebook groups for gun violence survivors and getting to know each other's families.

News stories often refer to Sullivan's ""superhero-like"" insistence on creating positive outcomes from shootings. It's part of his ""Irish DNA,"" Sullivan jokes. ""We're kind of built for death and problems in our lives.""

Sullivan and his son bonded over superheroes during regular trips to All C's Collectibles, a comic book store just down the road from where James Holmes killed Alex and 11 others at a midnight screening of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Alex was there with friends to celebrate his 27th birthday.

In the wake of the shooting, Sullivan joined forces with Jason Farnsworth, owner of All C's, to launch Aurora Rise -- a Batman-themed charity that provides financial and moral support to Aurora survivors.

Sullivan also uses his postal service past to reach out to labor unions, a group he says is ""not our friend on gun violence prevention issues.""

The son of Air Force parents, his family moved around before settling in Rochester, New York. He grew up playing sports instead of hunting and fishing. After he joined the Air Force, he picked up a firearm just once -- during basic training.

He married his childhood sweetheart, Terry, and they moved to Colorado in 1980. He got a union job delivering express mail so he could someday retire with a pension. He worked hard to provide for his wife and ""Irish twins,"" Alex and daughter Megan, born 15 months later.

He raised Alex to play by the same rules. Alex wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong time when he was killed, his father says. ""He was right where he was supposed to be, at the movies, celebrating his birthday with his friends.""

Sullivan thought he had done his part to protect his family, and he assumed the gun industry was doing theirs to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.

Then he sat through the trial of his son's killer and was alarmed to learn how easy it was for Holmes to assemble his artillery unnoticed: He had 4,000 rounds drop-shipped to the FedEx near the coffee shop where Megan worked; he periodically showed up at a shooting range with a trunk full of ammo for practice; he spent $11,000 in three months on firearms, tear gas, ammo and body armor.

Dougherty's sister and school psychologist Mary Sherlach was killed at Sandy Hook.

Nobody connected the dots.

""We have a whole section of the government that's supposed to be watching for terrorists coming, and it's pretty clear a terrorist could be sitting right here and order all the ammo he wants,"" Sullivan said.

""You come to learn that it's run by an industry whose only interest is to make money, sell more guns and keep the public scared.""

Before the shooting, Sullivan was a sports fan, another passion he shared with his son. After July 20, 2012, ""that stopped."" Now he's a news junkie, and fighting to change gun laws has become his life.

It's much the same for Dougherty. Like Sullivan, guns were not a part of her life growing up in Binghamton, New York, the fourth of five children. Now, she admits it's an obsession, a promise she made to her sister on the day of her funeral.

A graduate of New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, Dougherty built a successful business designing wedding dresses -- first by word of mouth in Westchester County, then again in Colorado. It's the other half of what she wryly calls her ""sad reality show"" life: ""guns and brides.""

The first time she thought about gun violence was December 8, 1980, when John Lennon was gunned down outside his Central Park West home. She was living in Manhattan at the time, and it felt close to home.

After she moved to Littleton with her first two children in 1992, gun violence continued to swirl around her, getting closer and closer.

First came Columbine, in 1999. She remembers filling up her car at a gas station on the road to Columbine High School when police cars zipped past, sirens screaming. Her children's two schools were locked down.

Then, in 2010, a gunman opened fire outside Deer Creek Middle School, where her youngest daughter, born in Colorado, once attended. Two students were injured before her daughter's former math teacher tackled the gunman.

Dougherty was in her workshop, sewing dresses for clients, when she learned about the shooting at Deer Creek. She was putting the final touches on her daughter's wedding dress in her workshop when she learned about Aurora on TV.

It's also where she was when she got the phone call from her husband saying there'd been a shooting in Connecticut.

She knew that gun violence had finally caught up with her family.

The last time she'd seen Mary alive was that August, at the wedding of Dougherty's daughter. Married for 31 years with two children of her own, Mary had flown in from Connecticut. Though the sisters spoke often by phone, it was a rare reunion, so Dougherty sat Mary at the family table.

""I was selfish and I wanted her at my table because I never get to see her,"" Dougherty says. ""I'll always remember her walking in my house and giving her a hug in my foyer.""

Dougherty has found solace and solidarity with the survivor community. They're like family, which is why she jumped at the chance to help Sullivan's daughter prepare for her own wedding. It would fall during the trial of Alex's killer. Perhaps she could make it easier on them.

After seeing Megan write on Facebook about problems find a wedding dress, Dougherty reached out, reminded her she worked in bridal and invited her to the shop.

Jane Dougherty with her sister on Mary's wedding day in 1981.

Megan came in with her mother, Terry, and chose an A-line strapless dress. Dougherty customized it with a netted neckline and added pearl buttons from Terry's wedding dress up the back.

While working on Megan's dress, she couldn't help but think of the first bridal gown she made. It had been in 1981, when she was still in New York. It was for her sister Mary.

""I was just so happy that Megan was smiling,"" Dougherty says. The dress was her gift -- from one surviving sister to another.

26 voices on why the free press matters,"(CNN) 2017 was a year when discussions of press freedom and the media's choices reached a new level of intensity.

White House briefings, presidential tweets and rallies critiqued the media.

Journalists pushed back, while engaging in lively debate about the ways they approach their work.

And, perhaps fittingly, the year is about to end with the release of ""The Post,"" a Steven Spielberg film, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, that retells the story of how an administration tried, and ultimately failed, to stop newspapers from printing a damning government report about the Vietnam War.

"'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert","Macao (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ You can smell it before you see it. The sweet smell of sugar, egg and custard, baking til it's cooked just right. Flaky pastry on the outside, soft custard on the inside, and crispy, burnt, sugar on top.

It's the signature smell of Margaret's CafÃÂ© e Nata -- one of the most popular places to eat in Macao, a former Portuguese colony.

The cafe is especially famous for one thing: the Macanese egg tart. It's a sweet pastry inspired by its Portuguese and Chinese counterparts, made fresh daily by owner Margaret Wong.

If visitors aren't there for a treat from the bakery, chances are they're there to see Wong.

After three decades in the food business, she's a colorful personality who still spends every day working hard at the cafe. She can be spotted working the cash register or bustling about in the kitchen.

A family affair

Few people know Macanese egg tarts better than Wong, who began making the dish 30 years ago with her late ex-husband Andrew Stow.

The couple founded their first bakery business, Lord Stow's, in 1989. Today, Lord Stow's is run by their daughter Audrey and Andrew's sister Eileen.

Margaret's CafÃÂ© e Nata, which she subsequently founded in 1992, is entirely run by Wong herself.

Some online reports suggest that Wong founded her cafe to compete with Lord Stow's -- which netizens claim was born as a result of a domestic feud following the couple's divorce.

She wouldn't comment on the rumors, though she spoke openly about the early days of their romance.

""We were married three times -- once in Hong Kong, once in England and once in a church,"" she says.

According to Wong, the couple met in a local church, where she played the organ.

""One day my foster mother was visiting from America, and we bumped into Andrew, who gave me a hug and a kiss and I went all red. He was friends with everybody so I didn't think I was anything special ... but my mother said 'Margaret, I think this is the right one for you.'""

The two were married in 1988.

Up to 10,000 tarts a day

Together, the couple created their signature egg tart dish, which is now an iconic Macao dish. Purists argue this egg tart tastes nothing like its Portuguese or Chinese counterparts.

According to Wong, that's the point.

""When we started our bakery, someone asked Andrew to make a pasteis de nata, because they were very popular in Portugal. The first tray came out burnt and wrong, and Andrew wanted to throw them away. I said, hold on, they're edible, so let people just try them. They tried one, and then two, and by the third I said, 'I have to charge you because clearly, it's good!' ""

It's this same recipe, three decades later, that continues to be sold across Macao.

Today, hundreds of tourists and locals alike line up at her cafe for a bite of this now famous pastry.

Wong's cafe alone can make up to 10,000 tarts a day -- all of which are bound to sell out.

""Sometimes people walk in and say -- can I have just one egg tart -- and I say, not even one bite.""

'Like the tart, I never change'

Visitors to Margaret's CafÃÂ© e Nata will usually find her in the kitchen or behind the till. CNN

Every single dish sold by the bakery is graced with Wong's magic touch. In addition to egg tarts, other items on the menu include brownies, cakes and croissants. There's also a salad and sandwich bar.

Despite long working hours, and the physically demanding nature of her work, she still spends almost every day bouncing back and forth between the kitchen and the shop.

""Some of my staff have been working with me for 15 years, they know everything, but still sometimes I have to make sure everything is good -- I'm the boss!"" she says.

She's the boss, but she's also a local celebrity. During our interview Wong is regularly interrupted by friends and fans dropping by to wish her well.

""I open the shop at 8:30 a.m., and I'm here until we close at 4:30 p.m., and I have an hour for lunch. My friend's say I'm crazy... and I'm exhausted,"" she says with a laugh. ""I say I'm getting old, that's why.""

Clearly young at heart, Wong abruptly cuts our interview short, informing us she needs to head to a rock 'n' roll dance class -- but leaves us with a taste of wisdom.

This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power,"London (CNN Business) Too much clean energy. It's an unusual problem to have, and one that's spurred a group of islands off the northern coast of Scotland to become an unlikely pioneer in hydrogen power .

Orkney, better known for its breathtaking coastal scenery and some of Britain's oldest heritage sites than for its cutting edge approach to energy , has been quietly pioneering hydrogen technology.

Abundant rainfall, strong winds and powerful waves mean the island chain's entire electricity demand is already met through renewable resources . But in recent years, Orkney's grid couldn't handle the amount of power being generated from its ever expanding wind farms, Megan McNeill, Orkney projects manager at Community Energy Scotland, told CNN Business.

Wind turbines needed to be switched off on a daily basis, as power cables reached capacity, leaving clean energy unused.

Rather than waste the excess electricity, the islands decided to harness it. It was here that in 2017 the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), in a world first, used tidal energy to split water and make hydrogen Ã¢ÂÂ a process known as electrolysis.

That was just the beginning. The success of that project spurred collaboration between EMEC, Community Energy Scotland and others to do the same with excess wind energy. Surf 'n' Turf, a project funded by the Scottish government, combined excess electricity from tidal and wind turbines to create hydrogen, another world first.

Hydrogen is viewed as an important part of the transition to a cleaner future because it emits no carbon. It can also be stored and is seen as a potential replacement to natural gas

But traditional hydrogen production relies almost entirely on fossil fuels and is responsible for 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. That is equivalent to the CO2 emissions of the United Kingdom and Indonesia combined, according to the International Energy Agency.

Producing hydrogen power remains expensive, but Orkney's success in creating hydrogen using clean energy demonstrates that it can be done at scale. The islands are already using hydrogen to power vehicles and a local primary school.

Now, Orkney is hoping to use hydrogen fuel cells to power a seagoing vessel able to transport both goods and passengers.

""We're hoping it can be the world first,"" said hydrogen manager at EMEC, Jon Clipshim, adding, ""there is a race on.""

"India identifies 29 coronavirus cases as global infections top 95,000","Hong Kong (CNN) A spike in novel coronavirus in India has prompted concerns that the world's second-most populous country could face a serious outbreak of the virus, which to date has infected more than 95,000 people and killed at least 3,300 worldwide.

Twenty-nine cases have been confirmed inside the country, including three who have recovered. Many of the cases are linked to a group of travelers from Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said.

Authorities in the country have advised caution, but have not raised the alarm. Vardhan told lawmakers in parliament Tuesday that public health authorities are focusing on India's ""core capacities for disease preparedness and response.""

The government has begun screening all passengers arriving in the country for coronavirus.

""The scale and extent of our interventions have increased in alignment the evolving situation of COVID-19 across the world, and India in particular,"" he said, referring to the disease by its formal name. ""With the increasing global spread of the disease, we are confronted with new challenges. The contact tracing of positive cases requires the tracing of hundreds of contacts in multiple locations and monitoring their health.""

Vardhan also said the government was preparing a ""containment plan"" for the city of Agra -- home to the Taj Mahal -- where a cluster of cases has been identified.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said ""there is no need to panic"" earlier this week on Twitter and advised the public that the government is ""working together"" to stop the virus from spreading further.

Modi said Wednesday he would not attend next week's Holi celebrations -- the Hindu festival that marks the start of spring in which revelers throwing bright-colored powdered paint -- because of advice from experts to avoid mass gatherings. Holi festivities at the presidential palace were also canceled.

Authorities around the globe are taking similar steps now that the virus has spread to more than 80 countries and territories across every continent except Antarctica. Since it was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, major self-sustaining clusters have formed in South Korea, Japan -- which recorded its biggest one-day increase of cases on Wednesday , with 33 new patients identified -- parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.

The vast majority of cases, however, are still in mainland China. The country's National Health Commission (NHC) reported that as of the end of the day Wednesday, 3,012 people had died and 80,409 cases had been confirmed. More than 52,000 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, per the NHC.

Economic woes

The virus' spread is also having significant knock-on effects on the global economy and daily life. Markets worldwide have reacted negatively, forcing finance officials and central banks to take action. Government agencies and private companies across the globe have canceled or postponed public functions.

Movie studios MGM and Universal have postponed the release of the latest James Bond movie ; authorities in Japan and Italy have closed major tourist hubs like the Tokyo Skytree or Milan's Teatro alla Scala; theme parks around the world have been shuttered; governments have shut schools; and sporting events in country's most affected areas are sometimes being played behind closed doors.

The outbreak could cost the Travel and tourism has been among the most affected industries.The outbreak could cost the airline industry as much as $113 billion in lost revenue, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

IATA said global passenger growth for January 2020 was the slowest in nearly a decade, climbing only 2.4% from a year earlier, because of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

""January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January,"" Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO, said in a statement.

United Airlines became the first airline to cut its US flight schedule on Wednesday, as passenger concerns about the coronavirus has caused a sharp drop in demand. UK airline Flybe collapsed Thursday as a slump in demand for flights due to the outbreak dealt the final blow to the struggling carrier.

Passenger uncertainty about travel has prompted major US airlines and some international ones to suspend or waive certain change and rebooking fees, which itself is hurting their revenue.

Executives from most of the major airlines, including United CEO Oscar Munoz, met with US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday to discuss the impact of the coronavirus on air travel and how to coordinate activity between the industry and the government.

In response to a question, President Trump said he did not believe that the airlines would need a bailout, similar to the one they received in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

""Don't ask that question please, because they haven't asked (for) that. I don't want you to give them any ideas,"" said Trump about the possibility of a bailout. He said the idea had not been discussed. He also said he believes flying is safe.

""Where these people are flying, it's safe to fly,"" he said.

US attempts to increase testing

On Wednesday , the Vice President said the Trump administration is prioritizing making it easier for Americans to be tested for the virus.

""Our objective is to make tests available broadly to the American public. We want to make sure the American people can go to their doctor, can go to the local MedCheck or CVS, and obtain access,"" said Pence, who Trump tasked with overseeing the federal government's coronavirus task force.

Speaking at a news conference, Pence highlighted the various steps the government is taking to stop the virus from spreading further.

""The risk to the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low. But at the President's direction, we are bringing the full resources, not just of the American government, but the American economy, to make sure that in our meeting with the pharmaceutical companies, that we have -- that we're developing vaccines, which may not be available for another year or year and a half, but we're also developing therapeutics that we believe could be available in fairly short order for people that are struggling with coronavirus,"" he said.

Nearly 160 cases have been identified in the United States and 11 people have been killed. Ten of the fatalities occurred in Washington state , where many of the patients and victims have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. A federal disaster medical assistance team is set to arrive in Kirkland Thursday to help staff at the facility.

The other fatality is in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. Those two states have so far been the hardest-hit, with Washington detecting at least 39 infections and California at least 36.

Newsom also said that one cruise ship off the coast of California, the Grand Princess, has been affected by the outbreak, with 10 crew members and 11 passengers showing virus symptoms. The ship is being held at sea while authorities test for the virus.

Cruise ships can be especially vulnerable to viral illnesses, like the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were infected while aboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise liner that was forced to quarantine most of its guests off the coast of Japan.

Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets,"Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mohammad Shareef began burying bodies after his son's death

Mohammad Shareef never got to bury his son. Instead, he has spent the last 27 years burying the unclaimed sons and daughters of thousands of other families.

It took a month for police to tell Mr Shareef that his son had died, and even then, they couldn't tell him where, or how.

All Mr Shareef knows is that his son, Mohammad Rais, was one of almost 2,000 people killed in the Hindu-Muslim riots which engulfed India following the destruction of a mosque on a disputed religious site in 1992.

Mr Shareef doesn't even know where the 25-year-old was buried.

""Police told me his body had decomposed,"" Mr Shareef recalled, almost three decades on. ""We didn't see his body. We only got his clothes.""

But a few months later, he would witness something which would change his life forever.

""One day I saw police officers throwing a body into a river. I was horrified,"" Mr Shareef says.

Along with the horror, came a realisation.

""I think my son's body might have been thrown into a river, just like other such dead bodies. That day I said to myself, from today I am the guardian of abandoned dead bodies and I will give them a proper funeral.""

Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mr Shareef says his wife Bibi never recovered from the death of their son

Unclaimed bodies pile up in India for a host of reasons: they could be people who lost their lives in road and rail accidents, or people who died far from home - pilgrims, migrants, old people abandoned by their children.

Some impoverished patients die in hospital with no-one to take care of the funeral.

But what to do with the bodies? Back in 1992, many districts in India didn't have a mortuary facility. It was fairly common practice to dispose of unclaimed bodies quickly.

Burial was the preferred method, but in some places in north India they dumped unclaimed human remains into rivers to save money, time and effort.

More stories from India

Mr Shareef's family have long suspected that Rais' body ended up in the Gomti river. It flows past Sultanpur, the city where the young man had been working as a chemist in December 1992 - the month when Hindu fundamentalists tore down the 16th Century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, Mr Shareef's home, 65km (40 miles) away.

Rais went missing amid the bloodshed which followed.

""After my son disappeared I searched for him everywhere for a month, like a mad man,"" his father says. ""I didn't find him anywhere. I even went to Sultanpur to look for him.""

Then came the news they had been dreading: their beloved son was dead. Mr Sharif and his wife Bibi were traumatised. His wife still struggles with periods of depression to this day.

The pain is aggravated by the fact they were not able to give their son a proper burial. It is a pain no one else should go through, Mr Shareef says.

""I decided that in my district, I wouldn't let any unidentified body be thrown away into a river,"" he says.

Image copyright Mohd Shabir Image caption Shareef says he takes care of the unknown dead persons as he would a family member

In India's caste-bound Hindu society, those who were at the bottom were historically forced to do the job of burial and cremations - and then treated as ""untouchables"" as a result.

But Mr Shareef - a bicycle mechanic by trade - was not to be deterred. He told the police about his desire to take up a task shunned by everyone else.

""When I got the first call, my heart was pounding. After the post-mortem, the police asked me to take away the body. I clearly remember that person's neck was slashed.""

Soon, his workload started to increase. He even bought a four-wheeled cart to transport the dead.

Predictably his family members, friends and neighbours were taken aback. Even as a Muslim, Mr Sharif began to experience the same social exclusion as his Hindu colleagues.

""No-one in my family was happy at that time. They said, 'you have gone mad'.

""Some people were afraid of me. They thought they would get infected with germs if they made physical contact with me.""

Yet Mr Shareef was resolute in his conviction. He had skipped family weddings, festivals and even prayers for the sake of unknown people. It gave him peace and solace: performing last rights is a moment to remember his son.

""It helped me to deal with the pain of my son's death. I think about him all the time. I miss him.""

It is not an easy job. Police often struggle to identify the body, which means they may have been dead for some time. Often it is not the bodies, Mr Shareef says, but the smell which is most off-putting.

""Whenever I see a badly mutilated or decomposed body it is difficult to sleep. I have nightmares and resort to sleeping tablets,"" he explains.

""Sometimes police officials come with me to the cemetery but even they stand far away.""

All the same, he always takes the time to ensure the person is given the proper treatment, usually bathing the body.

If he realises the dead person is Muslim, he wraps the body in a sheet of cloth and recites the final prayers. If the body belongs to a Hindu, he takes it to be cremated.

No-one know exactly how many bodies Mr Shareef has buried. The head of Ayodhya district administration, Anuj Kumar Jha, told the BBC that they don't have full records of the bodies handed over to Mr Shareef.

""Our rough estimate is we would have given about 2,500 bodies to him,"" he said. Mr Shareef's family say he has given last rites to more than 5,500 people.

Yet for years, he toiled without any financial support. To this day, he works in his bicycle shop, earning the equivalent of about $3 a day.

Image copyright Shabir Image caption Mr Shareef continues to run his roadside cycle repair shop to provide for himself and his wife

But things are changing. He has been recognised for his dedication. The government has given him one of India's highest civilian awards, while local shop owners now also help cover his expenses. At the age of 80, he is now able to have two paid assistants who are sharing his burden.

""Both Hindus and Muslims help me. People give me food and warm blankets. Recently I had to have an eye operation - a stranger called me and gave me 20,000 rupees [$290].""

But retirement is not something he is willing to consider. Neither his two surviving sons nor grandchildren want to follow in his footsteps, and he is acutely aware of what will happen if he stops doing this work.

""If I am not there, police will throw the bodies into rivers as they did before.""

For a man who some call the ""saviour of the dead"" that would be unbearable.

""I will continue doing this till my last breath,"" he says.

Senegal partners with UK lab to develop a hand-held coronavirus test kit,"(CNN) UK-based laboratory Mologic is working with scientists in Senegal to make a diagnostic test for coronavirus that can produce test results within 10 minutes, the company said.

The handheld device is the first diagnostic kit developed in the UK to be jointly-manufactured in Africa, according to Mologic in a statement announcing the UK-funded initiative.

The laboratory said it was working with the Pasteur Institute in Dakar and five other international research organizations to authenticate the test kits that will be produced by DiaTropix, a manufacturing facility also in the West African nation.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the lab last week and announced a ÃÂ£46 million fund (approximately $58 million US dolllars) for British experts to find vaccines and develop test kits to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent future outbreaks of the virus.

Boris Johnson visits the Mologic Laboratory on March.

Mologic said it received a ÃÂ£1 million (about $1.3 million USD) from the fund to make a rapid test kit that works without electricity and does not need a laboratory analysis to give results for coronavirus, paving the way for health workers to detect cases and place people under quarantine quickly.

Four women were serious candidates for president. What happened?,"Swanee Hunt, former US ambassador to Austria, is founder of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and founder of Seismic Shift, an initiative dedicated to increasing the number of women in high political office. She is also the author of ""Rwandan Women Rising."" The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) On Thursday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced the end of her presidential campaign after a disheartening performance in the primary elections. Now there is only one woman running for the highest office in the land -- a woman who, by any polling metric, has virtually no chance of winning.

In 2007, when Hillary Rodham Clinton first announced ""I'm in, and I'm in to win,"" she stoked hope in all who dream of political parity -- that a woman could soon be president of the United States. In the immediate aftermath of Clinton's 2016 candidacy, and her loss to a flagrant misogynist, countless women ran for public office.

So, it was promising to see six Democratic women step up to contend for president this time around. Even if two -- author Marianne Williamson and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- seemed to many like longshots, for a variety of reasons, that left four highly qualified women in the race: Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Now, the chance that a woman will win the 2020 presidential race has imploded.

What happened?

There's no question that sexism played a role in bringing us to this point. But social influences are wicked problems: they are diseases, hard to diagnose, even harder to cure.

As is often, perhaps always, the case, these female candidates seemed held to a higher standard when it came to being presidential, electable -- and even likeable. In fact, for women, those three characteristics war with one another. A woman who seems nurturing (likable) pays a steep price. Gillibrand, chose to take a soft approach by wearing dresses in contrast to the suits (with pants) that many female candidates wear. Yet beyond optics, she took on issues more overtly women-focused than those of her competitors.

And Harris. Did her strong show of boldness, as when she confronted Vice President Biden on race, make her unlikeable? Why was she, like Gillibrand, unsuccessful in garnering support? Beyond garden-variety campaign problems, what unseen forces stood in the way? Harris wasn't simply a black candidate; our former president blazed that trail. She was a black woman.

As the campaign continued, Warren and Klobuchar established themselves as powerful, and presidential -- far more, surely, than most men in the race. Hence The New York Times endorsement of not one, but both. But by then Warren had fallen in the polls. Some questioned her ability to take on President Donald Trump, fueling doubt about her electability. In Nevada, Warren called attention to the no-win situation she faced as a female politician: ""If you complain about it, then you are whining,"" she said . ""And if you don't complain about it, the rest of the women think, 'what planet are you living on?' And so, you get caught in between the two.""

Klobuchar had taken the approach of emphasizing that she was running on her merits, not her gender -- though she would nonetheless be proud to be the first female president.

Unabashedly, she called out sexism when she commented during one debate, in reference to former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, that no female mayor of a small city would be in his position in the race.

Was that whining? Questions like this, even when uttered in a seemingly neutral context, are potentially toxic. Women must work doubly hard to not only be tough, but do it in a way that's visibly appealing.

Likeability may be why Warren, in an Instagram video , pulled a Michelob Ultra out of her fridge as she was casually talking in her kitchen.

The irony is, of course, that the most detestable president in memory resides in a White House defiled by corruption, deception, greed, amorality -- in desperate need of a woman to shovel it all out.

Yes, we're seeing progress below the presidential level. Women make up about a quarter of the voting body of the 116th Congress, a record number (although the women in both chambers are predominantly Democrats).

Given that 100 long years ago American women gained the right to vote, it's hard for many of us to fathom the fact we have yet to take our seat behind the desk in the Oval Office. Perhaps in 2020 we'll see a woman vice president. That would be progress, but not the progress the nation needs for truly representative democracy.

In her book ""What Happened,"" Hillary Clinton recounts an apt story that David Foster Wallace told at a 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College. Two young fish are swimming along when an older fish coming toward them nods and says, ""Mornin', boys. How's the water?"" The young fish blithely swim on. Eventually, one looks at the other: ""What's water?""

In fact, the most important realities can be the hardest for voters to see and talk about. But see and talk we must. Sexism was a force in this year's Democratic primary.

Do I need a flu shot?,"Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez is a primary care pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

(CNN) The concerning scenario has played out in my office over and over again this season. ""Your child is due for the flu vaccine today"" is interrupted by, ""Oh, no, doctor -- we don't like to put unnecessary things in their body.""

The argument comes from parents who vaccinated their children against the flu at ages 1, 2, 3 and 4; parents of children who tolerated the vaccine well, who did not contract the flu, and yet at age 5 the flu shot suddenly became ""unnecessary."" I'm even hearing it from parents of siblings. For the child under age 5, parents agree to the flu shot; for the child over age 5, they decline it.

So, what changes at this magical age of 5? Schools in New York City, where I practice, stop requiring the flu shot . ""Not required"" has translated into ""not necessary.""

As dangerous as this misconception is, it's hard to blame parents when their reasoning is, after all, very logical: If the flu shot was truly necessary, wouldn't schools require it, like they require so many other childhood vaccinations? Not exactly.

In the United States, vaccine requirement laws are set by each state . Currently only a handful of states, New York included, require children to be vaccinated against the flu to enter daycare or pre-K. It is therefore not surprising that when researchers recently looked at the number of daycare centers around the country that required children to be vaccinated against the flu, they found only 24.5% did so. And once children turn 5, right as they enter elementary school, the flu shot requirement in these handful of states goes away altogether.",human
"Coronavirus outbreak worsens in Italy and Japan, as situation stabilizes in China","Hong Kong (CNN) The number of people infected with the novel coronavirus has surpassed 115,000, with the death toll reaching more than 4,200, as countries around the world continue to grapple with the challenges of containing the pandemic.

On Wednesday, China reported a slight increase in new daily cases, overturning several consecutive days of fewer new infections. The rise, from 19 on Monday to 24 on Tuesday, has been attributed to individuals returning from overseas, underscoring the difficulties faced by governments as the virus continues to spread rapidly across multiple continents.

Neighboring Japan and South Korea also saw an uptick in numbers Tuesday, with Japan reporting 54 more cases -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.

Authorities in South Korea, meanwhile, confirmed 242 new cases, bringing the national total to 7,755.

As with China, the infection rate in South Korea had slowed in recent days, bringing hope that the situation was beginning to stabilize. Though one of the world's worst hit countries, South Korea has been lauded for its widespread testing drive, which has so far seen around 200,000 people screened for the virus. However, new outbreaks linked to a call center in Seoul and the country's military are likely to alarm officials.

Western countries are also struggling with their own worsening outbreaks. The number of cases in the US has now reached at least 1,000, with numerous states declaring emergencies.

In Europe, cases have now been confirmed in every member nation of the European Union. Italy remains on total lockdown as its healthcare system struggles to cope, while nearby countries like Germany and France report alarming spikes in daily cases.

In a speech earlier this week, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated that different countries are facing ""different scenarios,"" with each requiring a tailored response. ""It's not about containment or mitigation -- which is a false dichotomy. It's about both,"" said Tedros.

Hubei aims to get back to business

China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, will allow businesses to gradually come back online and will resume some public transportation services, the provincial government said in a statement Wednesday.

Checkpoints will continue to be set up to screen anyone who wishes to enter or leave Hubei, while the government will also assist workers to return to their workplaces. Schools across the province will continue to be suspended until further notice, it added.

The decision comes as the number of cases in the province has declined significantly. Hubei was reporting thousands of infections a day just weeks ago. There were only 14 new infections reported in Hubei Tuesday, according to China's National Health Commission.

During a visit to Hubei's capital Wuhan on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that the country's control efforts had ""turned the tide."" Of the 80,778 people to have contacted the virus inside mainland China since the outbreak was first identified in December, 61,475 have recovered, according to the country's National Health Commission.

Japan sees a jump in cases

Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared to neighboring South Korea and China, however, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.

Japan now has 1,264 confirmed cases and 19 deaths. A total of 568 of the confirmed cases are on land and the remaining 696 cases are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

""In the past couple of days, for more than one week, we have been seeing an increase,"" said Yasuyuki Sahara, Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Health, on Tuesday night at a news conference.

Sahara cautioned that it was not yet ""an explosive outbreak,"" with the next one or two weeks likely to be crucial in the country's battle to contain the spread of the virus. ""That will determine whether there will be a rapid increase of spread, or whether the outbreak will be concluded,"" he added.

It's unclear whether the sudden spike in numbers is due to a genuine increase in infection, or whether it's due to factors like better detection.

Health experts in Japan have previously raised concerns over the country's approach to testing, which has seen only small numbers screened for the virus. Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the ""tip of the iceberg.""

If a bigger outbreak does arrive, it could serve a blow to the country's healthcare system. Sahara warned on Tuesday that hospitals are limited in capacity, and so the ministry is only encouraging those with severe symptoms to be tested.

Japan's outbreak, and the government's handling of it, has been under heightened scrutiny due to the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which organizers say are continuing as planned despite calls for cancellations.

In response to the outbreak, the country's cabinet has approved a bill that would enable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency. The draft bill, which would see the government given powers to to cancel public events and instruct people to stay indoors, is now heading to parliament, where it is expected to pass both chambers by Friday.

Italy is still under lockdown

The entire country of Italy was put under lockdown on Monday, extending drastic measures and restrictions that had previously only been in place in the north.

Since the outbreak arrived in Italy in late February, travelers have brought the virus from there to several European nations and to other regions of the world, including the US and Middle East.

Tuesday saw the biggest rise in coronavirus deaths since the outbreak began in the southern European nation. At least 168 people died in the past 24 hours, said Angelo Borrelli, head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency, on Tuesday.

That brings the national total to 10,149 cases and 631 deaths.

Italy's lockdown means residents' movements are restricted; military police, health officials, and other authorities are conducting checks at train stations, highways, and city roads to make sure people aren't traveling without permission. Schools are shut, public spaces like cinemas are closed, and typically bustling places like town squares are instead empty as people stay home.

Lydia Carelli, a 26-year-old intern at the Italian Supreme Court in Rome, told CNN: ""This is the strangest situation that I've ever lived, these restrictions are similar to times of war.""

The US reaches 1,000 cases

The situation appears to be worsening in the US , which reached 1,000 cases on Wednesday.

The number of patients identified has doubled since Sunday alone, indicating a dramatic exponential rise in infections. At least 31 people have died.

Washington state, where a nursing home in Kirkland was at the center of the outbreak, is still the hardest hit. California and New York aren't far behind, with more than 100 cases each, and Massachusetts is creeping toward the 100-case mark as well.

As these figures rise, communities are beginning to enact emergency measures. Numerous companies in virus-hit states are allowing employees to work from home; schools and universities are suspending classes, ending the semester early, or conducting online classes; states are declaring states of emergency, allowing them to access federal resources and funding; people are self-quarantining at home.

These measures echo the actions taken in countries across Asia just a month or two ago -- people in the US are even stocking up on face masks and hand sanitizer, reminiscent of the panic buying that swept Hong Kong in February.

But there are also drastic differences; countries like South Korea have rolled out widespread, aggressive testing, running thousands of tests every day. About one out of 250 people in South Korea have already been tested, said the vice minister of foreign affairs on Monday.

By comparison, the US -- with a population six times that of South Korea -- has only run about 3,700 tests in the federal CDC lab, and 4,800 in local public health labs across the country, according to the CDC.

But there could be confusion around these numbers, too -- Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday his department does not know exactly how many Americans have been tested.

""We don't know exactly how many, because hundreds of thousands of our tests have gone out to private labs and hospitals that currently do not report in"" to the CDC, Azar told CNN.",human

China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic,"BEIJING Ã¢ÂÂ China is pushing a new theory about the origins of the coronavirus: It is an American disease that might have been introduced by members of the United States Army who visited Wuhan in October.

There is not a shred of evidence to support that, but the notion received an official endorsement from ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose spokesman accused American officials of not coming clean about what they know about the disease.

The intentional spreading of an unfounded conspiracy theory Ã¢ÂÂ which recirculated on ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs tightly controlled internet on Friday Ã¢ÂÂ punctuated a downward spiral in relations between the two countries that has been fueled by the basest instinct of officials on both sides.

The insinuation came in a series of posts on Twitter by Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman who has made good use of the platform, which is blocked in China, to push a newly aggressive, and hawkish, diplomatic strategy. It is most likely intended to deflect attention from ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs own missteps in the early weeks of the epidemic by sowing confusion or, at least, uncertainty at home and abroad.",human
"The Catholic nun who made joyous, politically charged Pop Art","Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

At the end of the turbulent 1960s, the United States became enamored with Corita Kent, a nun who made joyous, politically charged and boldly colorful screen prints.

Featured on the cover of Newsweek in 1967 under the headline ""The nun: Going modern,"" she symbolized an evolving and more liberal Catholic Church. When she designed a stamp in 1985, the US Postal Service sold over 700 million of them.

""A lot of her works are about hope, and justice and love,"" said Nellie Scott, director of LA's Corita Art Center , which was set up after Kent's death to promote and preserve her legacy.

After Kent's death in 1986, her popularity steadily declined. That changed in 2007, when artist and curator Julie Ault reignited scholarly interest in her punchy, text-driven silk screens through the book ""Come Alive! The Spirited Art of Sister Corita.""

Like many other women artists , Kent's place in art history has been more thoroughly revisited through major exhibitions during the last decade, and her work is held in the collections of institutions including the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Last year, city authorities in Los Angeles, where she dedicated much of her life to teaching, named November 20 ""Corita Kent Day"" to mark what would have been her 101st birthday.

Most importantly, Kent has finally been credited for her contributions to Pop Art, a movement that male artists have long had a stronghold on.

""Not only were women discounted as producers of Pop, they were often hypersexualized as the represented objects of Pop Art,"" wrote curator Susan Dackerman in ""Corita Kent and the Language of Pop,"" a 2015 book accompanying an exhibition of the same name. Andy Warhol , for instance, was known for using stars like Marilyn Monroe and Edie Sedgwick as his muses and objects of desire.

""Stop the Bombing,"" (1967) by Corita Kent. Credit: Corita Art Center/Immaculate Heart Community

Kent's long-standing comparisons to Warhol can be traced back to a formative moment in 1962, when she saw his career-launching series of 32 Campbell's soup cans at Ferus Gallery in New York.

She began thinking about consumerism, branding and text, and how to incorporate them into her practice, which was largely figurative and spiritual. Yet she had been prescient in her approach: Believing in accessible art, she adopted silk-screening around a decade before Warhol popularized the medium.

""How do you get your message (...) into the world as fast as possible?"" Scott asked.

""(Printmaking) is really democratic. It's something that can be done fairly quickly, and you're able to put out multiples in the world.""

Born as Frances Elizabeth Kent in 1918, her creative spirit was encouraged by her father from a young age. She joined the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary aged 18, taking the name Mary Corita Kent. After earning degrees at what is now the California Institute of the Arts and the University of Southern California, she taught art at the Immaculate Heart College, and eventually became department head.

Kent was said to be an enthusiastic educator who demanded polished techniques from her students, though she did so using easy and approachable tools. She could often be found teaching on the streets of Los Angeles, her students armed with white cardstock that they cut holes into to form makeshift viewfinders.

With the world reduced to specific textures, colors and patterns, viewed through the cards' 1-inch by 1-inch cut-outs, she taught them to see their surroundings differently.

In the set of 10 rules that Kent made for art and life, number four guided her own practice and her teachings: ""Consider everything an experiment.""

Kent's own artistic progression began with layered, colorful compositions featuring biblical motifs and eventually evolved to incorporate typography and wordplay, including poetry, religious texts and protest slogans. After seeing the aforementioned Warhol show, she looked to mass media and pop culture, using Wonder Bread's branding to represent the holy body of Christ, or the General Mills logo as ""the big G,"" with theistic implications.

How do you fall in love with art?

She also grappled with racism and war. In 1965, following the Watts race riots in Los Angeles, Kent made ""My people,"" which combined front-page news of the deaths from the uprising with writings from Father Maurice Ouellet, a white Catholic priest and civil rights activist who demonstrated in Selma, Alabama.

""I think that's where you see her really look at what's happening in the world,"" Scott said. Two years later, Kent's red, white and blue plea ""stop the bombing,"" against American involvement in the Vietnam War, began appearing at anti-war demonstrations.

Though Pope John XXIII had begun radically modernizing the Catholic Church in the 1960s, and Kent's own progressive sect enthusiastically embraced change, she still faced pushback for her work. The Archbishop of Los Angeles at the time, Cardinal James McIntyre, was a staunchly traditional thorn in her side, and became incensed over her 1964 print that declared: ""Mary Mother is the juiciest tomato of them all"" -- a reference to Del Monte's tomato sauce slogan.

Kent ultimately left the church in 1968, with her entire order later following suit to become a nondenominational congregation. With Boston as her new home, her work became more secular.

In 1969, she produced the series ""Heroes + Sheroes,"" which asked critical questions such as, ""Why not give a damn about your fellow man?"" as well as more optimistic declarations like, ""Hope arouses as nothing else can arouse a passion for the possible.""

The 1964 print ""The Juiciest Tomato of All,"" proved controversial with some members of the Church. Credit: Corita Art Center/Immaculate Heart Community

""Thinking through the work that she made after she left and spent the rest of her life in a more secular environment, (I think) that was ready to bubble out of her,"" Scott said of Kent's political works. ""And that was probably something that she would not have been able to do while she was in habit.""

How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all,"(CNN) Completing an unbeaten Premier League campaign was always going to be a tall order for Liverpool, but few could have foreseen the league leader's undefeated streak ending in the manner it did.

Yet Watford, which stunned the Reds 3-0 at the end of last month , harbored quiet confidence ahead of the game, according to defender Christian Kabasele.

Watford has spent much of this season in the relegation zone, but the victory saw the Hornets take a step towards Premier League survival, on top of ending Liverpool's 44-game unbeaten run.

""We believed in ourselves the week before,"" Belgian international Kabasele, who joined Watford in 2016, told CNN Sport.

"The Clanwilliam cedar survived the last ice age, but its future hangs in the balance","Cederberg, South Africa (CNN) The rugged and beautiful Cederberg Mountains in South Africa's Western Cape are named after one of the rarest trees on the planet. The Clanwilliam cedar lives nowhere else in the world.

This iconic species originated up to 225 million years ago and survived the last ice age. But today it is critically endangered and its future hangs in the balance.

For the past 17 years, conservation manager Rika du Plessis has been committed to saving the Clanwilliam cedar. Historically, these trees were harvested for their wood but now they are facing another threat.

""Due to climate change ... the whole world is experiencing higher temperatures, lower rainfall,"" says du Plessis, who works for governmental conservation organization CapeNature.

Rika du Plessis, CapeNature.

Less rainfall prevents seeds from germinating naturally, she explains, and when they do germinate, the young trees struggle to survive without water. And she says increased temperatures are causing more fires. ""Once a tree is touched by fire, it dies,"" says du Plessis.

US conducts airstrikes against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq,"(CNN) The US carried out airstrikes on Thursday against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq, according to the US Defense Department.

The strikes come one day after the US assessed an Iranian-backed group was responsible for a rocket attack on a base where coalition forces are located, killing two American service members and one British service member.

The Defense Department on Friday identified the two US service members killed in the attack as Army Specialist Juan Miguel Mendez Covarrubias, 27, of Hanford, California and Air Force Staff Sgt. Marshal D. Roberts, 28, of Owasso, Oklahoma. The UK Ministry of Defense had earlier identified the slain UK service member as Lance Corporal Brodie Gillon.

The UK government expressed support for the US airstrikes, with the UK's Defense Secretary Ben Wallace saying ""We support the right of the United States to defend themselves, as they have done tonight.""

A US defense official told CNN that the strikes were carried out by manned fighter aircraft and targeted five weapons storage facilities.

In a written statement, the Defense Department stated the strike was aimed at harming the ability of Kata'ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored Shia militia group, to conduct future strikes against American troops. The weapons storage facilities included areas where weapons used to attack American and coalition troops were stored.

""These strikes were defensive, proportional, and in direct response to the threat posed by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups (SMG) who continue to attack bases hosting OIR coalition forces,"" the department statement read.

The statement added, ""These terror groups must cease their attacks on U.S. and coalition forces or face consequences at a time and place of our choosing. The US and the coalition remain committed to the lasting defeat of ISIS, and the long-term security, stability, and sovereignty of Iraq.""

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command which oversees US forces in the Middle East, told reporters Friday that the strikes had targeted storage sites housing ""advanced conventional weapons"" that he said had been provided to the militias by Iran, such as the 107mm rockets which were used in the deadly attack on Wednesday.

""We are confident that we have effectively destroyed these facilities and expect they will not longer be able to house the type of advanced Iranian-supplied weapons that were used in the Khatib Hezbollah attacks on the Iraqi base at Camp Taji,"" McKenzie said.

US Central Command also released images purporting to be the weapons storage facility targets hit in the airstrikes that took place near Baghdad.

The Iraqi government condemned the airstrikes in a statement Friday, saying that several Iraqi security force personnel were killed or wounded in the strikes.

Khatib Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia the US says was responsible for Wednesday's attack, is ostensibly part of the Iraqi security forces.

""These locations that we struck are clear locations of terrorist bases,"" McKenzie said Friday when asked about Iraq's opposition to the strike.

""If Iraqi military forces are there, I would say it's probably not a good idea to position yourself with Khatib Hezbollah in the wake of a strike that killed Americans and Coalition members,"" he added.

Tension with Iran

The strikes come months after the US and Iran were brought to the brink of war in early January. While the situation appeared to deescalate in the weeks following Iran's retaliatory strike on a base housing US troops in Iraq, tensions have flared up once again between Tehran and Washington.

There have been multiple rocket attacks in Iraq in recent weeks, but Wednesday's was the first to cause a US death since December, when a US contractor was killed. That death prompted retaliatory US airstrikes against Iranian-backed militia targets in Iraq and Syria. Trump administration officials pointed to the contractor's death as their justification for air strikes that killed Iran's second most powerful leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

The US was reviewing options as to how to respond, the US Defense secretary and top US general said earlier on Thursday.

""Yesterday's attack by Iranian backed Shia militia groups consisted of multiple indirect fires that originated from a stationary platform and was clearly targeting coalition and partner forces on Camp Taji,"" Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon while pledging that the US would take action to hold the attackers accountable.

""We're going to take this one step at a time. But we've got to hold the perpetrators accountable. You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it,"" Esper said.

President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he had been working on what to do about the attack on Wednesday night.

""They've sent a lot of rockets now. It hasn't been fully determined it was Iran,"" Trump said.

He added, ""It was a rebel group, but most likely it looks like it could be backed by Iran.""

Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the truck that fired the approximately 30 107mm rockets was captured by the Iraqi Security Forces and that forensics from that vehicle helped identify the attackers.

""We have pretty good confidence who did this. We were able to capture the truck, it was a modified truck with tubes, rocket tubes on the back, the Iraqi security forces did a good job in helping secure that truck. We have good indications based on forensics where it was fired from, who did the firing and so on and so forth,"" Milley said.

Milley said that 14 coalition personnel were also wounded in the attack, including five injuries that were considered ""urgent."" Those wounded included US, British, Polish and contractor personnel.

""The groups responsible will be held accountable appropriately,"" Milley said, adding, ""it was a significant attack and it resulted in the death and wounding of American (service members). So where we go from here as you would expect options are on the table and we are looking at everything and we will await final options and decisions from the President.""

Coronavirus effect

The series of strikes come as both Iran and the US struggle to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

McKenzie said Thursday he thinks the coronavirus outbreak in Iran ""is having an effect on how they make decisions,"" and that ""their inability to effectively respond to the coronavirus is I think inducing pressure on and inside the leadership.""

McKenzie said he thinks the coronavirus outbreak in Iran ""is having an effect on how they make decisions,"" and that ""their inability to effectively respond to the coronavirus is I think inducing pressure on and inside the leadership.""

""I think it probably makes them, in terms of decision making, more dangerous rather than less dangerous. But that's just my assessment,"" said McKenzie, adding that he believes ""the numbers are probably significantly underreported in terms of coronavirus victims in Iran.""

Asked why the Iranian groups chose to attack now, Milley said, ""There could be a lot of reasons, it could be coronavirus, it could be rogue Shia militia groups, it could be Soleimani's birthday, it could be a lot of things.""

McKenzie on Thursday said the outbreak was also ""going to have some effect on the military instrument"" when asked about the Iranian regular military and IRGC at a Senate Armed Services hearing.

The coalition strikes come one day after the House of Representatives approved a War Powers resolution aiming to rein in presidential authority to use military action against Iran without congressional approval.

The resolution -- introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat -- passed the Senate last month with bipartisan support despite Trump's vocal opposition.

It will now be sent to the White House, where Trump is expected to veto it. Congress is not expected to have enough votes to override a presidential veto. Although it is unlikely to become law, passage of the resolution by both chambers represents a significant rebuke to the President and highlights congressional support for efforts to check the executive branch's war-making powers.

'Onward' continues Pixar's apparent quest to make us cry,"(CNN) Pixar's enviable track record with original animation is a mixed blessing, creating sky-high expectations for each new movie. ""Onward,"" an undeniably emotional and imaginative concept, joins that rich tradition, without reaching the upper rungs of the ladder set by its predecessors.

Fundamentally about a pair of brothers dealing with lingering grief over the loss of their dad, the film adds a magical wrinkle to the premise by setting the story in a mythical world filled with elves, centaurs and pixies -- one where modern wonders and mechanization evolved very much along the lines of our own.

Still, hints remain of the magic that once ran rampant, we're told at the outset. And it's a belief in those fantastic possibilities that lead an elf Ian, just turned 16, and his goofball older brother Barley on a quest to bring their dad back, if only for a day.

That's right, the ""visitation spell"" that the pair invoke only lasts for 24 hours -- enough time, they reckon, to bid him a proper farewell. But something goes wrong (or there wouldn't be enough material for a movie), leaving dad reconstituted only from the waist down, as the two embark on a desperate mission to find the magical object that will allow them to complete the spell in time.

In a Marvel-ous pairing, Ian and Barley are voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, respectively, and they bring a goofy chemistry to their interaction, with the level-headed younger brother forced to ground the free-spirited older one.

Wakayama rafting: It's on logs -- and standing up!,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Think sitting in an inflated raft while rushing down white-water rapids is hardcore? You haven't tried the wildest rafting experience in Japan

Kitayama village , located about three hours from Osaka in Wakayama prefecture, offers tourists a chance to discover what it's like to sail down the swift currents of Kitayama River on traditional logging rafts.

Here's the kicker -- you're not even seated.

For the whole time, riders stand in a line on the sturdy, long wooden rafts, clutching only the metal/wooden handles that rise from the base of the rafts.

As terrifying as it looks to be a rider, the true cowboys on this journey are the guides.

Wooden oars in hand, they pilot the rafts down the river rapids while standing, wearing boots, a hat... and no life jacket.

The adventure sport was inspired by Japan's traditional lumber industry, in which felled wood was assembled into rafts then sent down the river -- a transport method used for more than 600 years. In the late 1970s, it was introduced to tourists.

Game? The rafting season lasts from May to September, with reservations accepted from April 1. Days and times vary depending on month. Minimum age to join is 10 years old. Price is 6,000 yen ($53) per adult, 3,000 yen per child.",human
Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption Soldiers have taken over key installations in the capital

For a day recently, the small West African country of Guinea-Bissau had two presidents and two prime ministers, until one of the presidents stepped down citing death threats.

The country has been gripped by political turmoil for so many years that analysts do not agree on exactly how many coups it has had in its 46 years of independence. Some say nine, others count 10. An election held last year was another attempt to carve a new peaceful path but it has sparked yet more chaos, as journalist Ricci Shryock reports.

Amidst the political chaos, daily life appears to be carrying on as normal in the capital, Bissau, but underneath the veneer, residents say they are deeply frustrated with the political chaos and confused about what will happen next and whom to believe.

While the Portuguese word ""saudades"" expresses a longing for the past, the feeling in Bissau is more akin to a longing for a more prosperous future they know is possible, but each time Bissau-Guineans' raise their hopes, they are dashed by political manoeuvring - often backed by guns.

Along the streets, women are selling the country's number-one cash crop - freshly harvested cashews.

But the presence of armed soldiers is a reminder that things are not normal.

The absence of trusted sources of news has provided good fodder for rumours and innuendo, with people constantly trying to parse what is true and what is not.

Contradictory official communiquÃÂ©s and letters from various sides, about who is the rightful president, are being shared on WhatsApp and Facebook in the country of 1.6 million people.

AFP Five things about Guinea-Bissau Population: 1.6 million

""We don't know what's going on,"" said a hotel manager, Aboubacar, as he scrolled through his Facebook feed. He furrowed his brow and frowned as he tried to decide which local blogs to read.

One restaurant owner, who said the chaos was hurting her business, added: ""For such a tiny country, it's amazing how much fake news we can produce.""

Umaro Cissoko EmbalÃÂ³ was announced as the winner of December's election.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Umaro Sissoco EmbalÃÂ³ has won two legal challenges and hopes to win a third

The long-time ruling party PAIGC however alleged it was cheated out of victory and insists that Mr EmbalÃÂ³ waits for the Supreme Court to rule on its third request to annul the elections. But he refused and has taken the oath of office.

And in the meantime, PAIGC lawmakers, who say that an alliance with smaller parties means they still have a majority in parliament, swore in one of its members as president and insisted their current prime minister stay in office.

However, shortly afterwards PAIGC Cipriano CassamÃÂ¡ stood down, citing fears for his safety.

Fake news fills the vacuum

""The problems in Bissau are structural problems, and the country has never really stabilised politically,"" said Gilles Yabi, founder of West African think-tank, Wathi.

""The country has the history of war, fighting for independence from Portugal, so the presence of the military is directly linked to this history, and the role the military played to get independence.""

Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption An uneasy calm has engulfed the streets of Bissau

He added there were other factors at play in the current crisis.

""The main problem is the political class of the country, and the fact that they have been fighting for power for a long time. The current situation is very polarised. Depending on whom you talk to, they will have quite a different version of things.""

There are two competing versions at the moment: While the PAIGC says the elections was rigged, the opposing side, MADEM-G15, says its candidate Mr EmbalÃÂ³ won December's polls and is now rightfully installed at the presidency.

Image copyright Dan Sanha Image caption Cipriano CassamÃÂ¡ was speaker of parliament until he briefly became president

The National Election Commission has repeatedly confirmed that Mr EmbalÃÂ³ won the polls with 54% of the vote, and at least one minister in his government has publicly accused their opponents of bribing a Supreme Court judge to rule in PAIGC's favour and stall the confirmation of Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s win.

Both sides say they have proof, but in the vacuum of that proof, residents' social media feeds are flooded with false news reports of weapons seizures at a political party's headquarters and politicians hiding out at foreign embassies - events that never happened.

Bissau and the cocaine trade

To add to the confusion, Guinea-Bissau has for many years been used as a staging post in the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America to Europe.

The PAIGC's Aristides Gomes, who still says he is the rightful prime minister, has claimed that narco-trafficking is the main factor behind the current political instability.

A brief history of Guinea-Bissau:

Image copyright AFP

1446-47: First Portuguese arrive; subsequently administered as part of the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, the Guinea area becomes important in the slave-trade. Guinea-Bissau becomes a separate colony in the Portuguese Empire in 1879.

1974: Independence following a guerrilla war.

1980: Country's first president, LuÃÂ­s Cabral, is ousted in military coup led by JoÃÂ£o Bernardo Vieira; plans for unification with Cape Verde dropped. The overthrow is the first of many political coups that undermine the country's stability over the next four decades.

2010: US names two top military officials as international drugs traffickers and freezes their US assets. EU announces it is ending mission to reform Guinea-Bissau's security forces, saying lack of respect for rule of law is making this an impossible task.

2011: EU suspends part of its aid to Guinea-Bissau because of concerns over governance and the rule of law. Several months later, thousands take to the streets to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Carlos Gomes JÃÂºnior for his failure to curb rising food prices.

2012: The UN Security Council expresses concern that drug trafficking has increased, and demands a return to constitutional rule.

2020: Umaro Cissoko EmbalÃÂ³ takes office

Experts say drug traffickers can profit from the current political chaos, and there were already reports that one notorious trafficker who had previously fled the country was spotted back in Bissau at a downtown hotel last week.

This report was denied by Ibrahima Jalo, an ally of Mr EmbalÃÂ³, who heads the association of 18 political parties which is not represented in the assembly.

""No, no, noÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Drug trafficking? In this country? No. Please. The drug trafficking here in Guinea-Bissau was maybe happening before, but it will never happen again.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Vultures are often seen as a portend of death in the region

In the past, the military and navy have been heavily linked to the country's drug trade.

In 2013, US Drug Enforcement Administration arrested the former head of the navy as he was attempting to close a million-dollar cocaine deal going through Guinea-Bissau.

Trafficking reportedly dropped off in Guinea-Bissau after that, but some experts say the recent few years of political crisis have reopened the corridor.

Amidst the chaos, nearly 1,000 hooded vultures were killed in a mass poisoning in the east of the country. Some said it was a bad omen for the country.

The birds were bubbling from their beaks in what the Vulture Conservation Foundation says is the worst mass vulture death event in recent memory in the world.

Fighting in the courts, not with guns

Vincent Foucher, a researcher for the French National Centre for Scientific Research, stresses that the latest iteration of the crisis appears at least for now to be more peaceful than some in the past.

""I think it's quite important to note that the elites have realised that now the competition is fought with and around legal norms. It's not about killing people - well for now - or coups. Let's hope it stays that way,"" he said.

However, all parties insist the law is on their side.

""It's always this thing that in Bissau people bend the law in one sense or another as suits their interests in the position of the moment. The law is bendable and it's not strong enough, not written clearly enough to an extent, and that's part of the problem even though it's not the cause of the problem,"" Mr Foucher added.

Foreign involvement is also complicating the situation.

Senegalese President Macky Sall has been outspoken in his support of Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s presidency and his Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Regional troops have been in Guinea-Bissau for years to prevent conflict

The PAIGC has, however, denounced Senegal for what it says is interference in Guinea-Bissau's internal politics and that it wants to control the country's development - or lack thereof - especially when it comes to contentious maritime rights along their shared border.

Regional body Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) has said Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s inauguration was outside the legal framework. A claim Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s supporters rejected.

Still dreaming of a better future

Meanwhile, young people in the country lament that the political crisis in the country has lasted their entire lives.

Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption Many young people are trying to work out a better future

Teachers and healthcare workers have been on strike since late last year, and many in the capital express a desire for the international community to intervene.

Ecowas was scheduled to send a team of experts to mediate this week, but they cancelled their mission under pressure from Mr EmbalÃÂ³ 's government at the last minute.

The UN Security Council also late last week urged security and defence forces not to interfere with the post-electoral political crisis.

Amid the chaos, at a cafÃÂ© across the street from both the presidential palace and the PAIGC headquarters, one man shrugged his shoulders in frustration over the crisis. ""As long as we are alive, we will dream,"" he said as he smiled nervously.",human
Schools knew of trouble before student deaths,"(CNN) Nolan Burch 's parents didn't know what West Virginia University knew -- that the fraternity their son was pledging had a history of bad behavior and was about to lose its charter.

And Marquise Braham' s parents didn't know what they say Penn State University allegedly knew -- that there were concerns about their son's well-being in the days leading up to his suicide.

All three sets of parents now believe they were kept in the dark by institutions they trusted to care for their sons.

The Burch, Hipps and Braham families share a common sadness -- their sons are dead, lost to what they believe was hazing-related behavior. They're three of the more than two dozen students who have died because of hazing at U.S. colleges and universities since 2008.

Samuel Mason, 20, died in 2010. He was allegedly made to drink a bottle of liquor in an hour while pledging Tau Kappa Epsilon at Radford University in Virginia. Radford University says that chapter of TKE had been found in violation of university policy earlier that year for serving alcohol to minors at a fraternity social event. His family sued and settled with the national fraternity and several of the local chapter's members.

Nolan Burch , a West Virginia University freshman, died in November 2014. His blood alcohol content was measured at 0.493 -- more than six times the legal limit to drive. His death led to the suspension of all Greek activities at WVU and criminal charges against two Kappa Sigma brothers.

And, CNN has learned, through record requests and other sources, that in five hazing-related deaths in as many years, institutions knew there was trouble before the deadly incidents happened.

'Occurrences of concern'

Nowhere on West Virginia University's website did it say that Kappa Sigma fraternity had a history of, as the school now puts it, ""occurrences of concern"" -- specifically referring to the fraternity ""behaving inappropriately and hosting an unsanctioned event."" The fraternity was also warned about overcrowding in its off-campus residence.

Burch, a WVU freshman, died following a fraternity hazing event in November 2014. His blood alcohol content was measured at 0.493, more than six times the legal limit to drive. His death led to the suspension of all Greek activities at WVU and criminal charges against two Kappa Sigma brothers.

Two days before the event, where police say Burch and others were blindfolded and forced to drink liquor, the national office of Kappa Sigma notified WVU that it was pulling the charter of the local fraternity chapter. According to a statement given to CNN, the national office directed the local chapter to stop holding functions. But that directive was ignored, according to the fraternity's national office.

""They'd been in so much trouble they (the national office) put cameras in the fraternity house,"" Burch's mother, Kim Burch, told CNN. ""The frat actually installed cameras.""

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

Kim and T.J. Burch say their 18-year-old son was not aware of the fraternity's troubles when he decided to pledge. No one told him, and no one told his parents either.

""We had no idea, unfortunately, until Nolan passed, that there had been so many problems,"" Kim Burch said. ""It's sad. It's really sad. If we had known this was going on, we would have never let him join this fraternity.""

'Unprecedented conduct issues'

That same semester, Tucker Hipps' family had no idea that Clemson University was having a serious problem with fraternities. The university was considering a moratorium on all fraternity events, but decided just three days before Hipps died to hold off.

It would later come out that Sigma Phi Epsilon violated five rules while Hipps was pledging, including violations related to hazing, harm to person, alcohol and organizational conduct. The university did not answer when asked by CNN if officials were aware of those five SigEp violations prior to Hipps' death.

Hipps, 19, died after he fell, jumped or was pushed off a bridge during a predawn run that was against the fraternity's hazing policy. There's an open criminal investigation and the family is suing the university and three fraternity members, who all have denied knowing how he died.

His parents say it was not for lack of trying that they did not know about the fraternity's problems.

Hipps' father, in particular, was opposed to his son joining a fraternity at Clemson.

""His dad was totally against it in the beginning,"" his mother said earlier this year. Cindy Hipps said she'd done her due diligence, even attending a Greek orientation meeting, which she said put her mind at ease.

""After that class I felt better about it,"" she said. ""They said kids in frats have better time management skills, set study times, did it as a group activity. Those kids had higher grade point averages. All the things a mother wants to hear, I heard. I convinced his dad to let him do it. Never once did I ever feel like my child would be harmed in any way.""

When she checked out Clemson's Greek life website, she saw only positive information, such as links to the average GPAs of each fraternity and sorority. There were two references to hazing policy, but nothing that explained which fraternities or sororities had been cited for violating those rules.

But at that time, Clemson officials were concerned about ""unprecedented conduct issues over the course of first 3 weeks of school,"" at several of the school's fraternities, according to internal documents obtained by CNN.

After Hipps' death, Clemson added a list of suspended fraternities to its website.

If Hipps' already-apprehensive parents had known what was going on at Clemson, they say, they would have pulled their son out of Greek life immediately.

Dangers are not myths

West Virginia University, Clemson and Penn State are not the only universities that brag about philanthropy, brotherhood and connections for life on their Greek life websites. Most schools list only the positives.

Clemson's says ""Greek organizations do hold social events, but most of these do not include alcohol.""

Penn State's goes as far as to say: ""For many parents, the fraternity and sorority community reminds them of images of the movie Animal House. There are many myths about the fraternity and sorority community, but the reality is that men and women in fraternities and sororities are committed to their academics, volunteer their time in the community, develop and strengthen their leadership skills, and form a campus network with other fraternity and sorority members.""

That kind of language outrages Doug Fierberg, an attorney for the Braham family, who recently sued Penn State on the family's behalf and who has handled dozens of university misconduct cases in his career.

""The dangers of fraternities are not myths. They are reality,"" Fierberg said. ""The failure by universities to tell the truth about the risks facing students in fraternities specifically related to hazing misuse and abuse of alcohol and other misconduct is the new battleground.""

""It needs to be changed nationally, because parents and students are entitled to timely and accurate information about the risks they face. And universities have no basis, morally or legally, to withhold that information from the university community,"" he said.

Some universities don't post a hazing policy on their Greek sites. For example, at West Virginia University, it's posted separately on the campus police site. (West Virginia University told CNN it is considering a number of changes, including ""better and more timely communication."")

Others have listed it in online FAQs, several clicks away from the positives.

There are very few universities that list fraternity infractions on their websites, and even when they do, it's often difficult to determine what the infractions really mean.

For example, after the 2008 alcohol poisoning death of Brett Griffin, 18, at the University of Delaware, Fierberg sued on behalf of the family and forced Delaware to change its Greek life site to list violations. But the list is vague , just listing things like ""multiple violations"" or ""social policy violations"" or ""hazing/alcohol"" without details of the incidents.

""You're looking at best practices,"" Fierberg said, referring to the University of Delaware site. ""What's 'multiple violations'? Were people hurt? Was a student hospitalized? What does it take to get suspended?""

Northern Illinois University adopted a policy of putting sanctions on its website after the 2012 death of David Bogenberger, a 19-year-old pledge who was forced to drink alcohol and died. (Twenty-two brothers from the Phi Kappa Alpha fraternity were criminally charged and sentenced to two years of court supervision, plus community service.) Three months after his death, NIU made the change, but the list isn't on the Greek life website -- and it's so hard to find, CNN had to ask the university to point out where it is. (It's on a separate page , one for the Office of Community Standards & Student Conduct.)

David Bogenberger

The relationship between universities and fraternities can be confusing, since many of them reside off-campus and are chartered by national organizations. But Fierberg said universities violate their duties to students and parents when they create websites about Greek life and only include feel-good information, instead of an accurate and complete picture.

And national fraternities are no better.

The only major fraternity that lists its violations is Sigma Alpha Epsilon, according to Fierberg, and that's because he sued SAE after the 2008 death of a fraternity pledge at California Polytechnic State University and forced it to list prior violations online.

Carson Starkey, 18, died of alcohol poisoning following an event where pledges were forced to drink alcohol, vomit, and drink some more. The SAE chapter at Cal Poly had a prior drug violation before the death, according to Cal Poly.

""(Universities) won't give you the full information because it will confirm that what you believe is right,"" Fierberg said. ""Of course you have a zero tolerance policy. (Hazing is) illegal. ... But why wouldn't you tell parents it's still going on?""

Fierberg said he suspects that the universities don't even write their own language for these Greek life information sites, since many of them look the same. In fact, a Google search of ""myth"" and ""Greek life"" and ""hazing"" and "".edu"" shows nearly identical definitions of hazing on the websites of dozens of schools.

Mental health emergencies

Marquise Braham jumped off the roof of a Marriott in Nassau County, New York, in March of 2014, the same year that Hipps and Burch died. A source close to the case says there was evidence of alcohol-fueled physical and sexual hazing prior to Braham's suicide.

Marquise Braham

Fierberg is representing Braham's family in its lawsuit against Penn State.

Fierberg claims the university was aware there were ""serious concerns"" about the ""well-being and psychological health"" of Braham, 18, in the days leading up to his suicide.

Phi Sigma Kappa told CNN it hasn't seen the lawsuit and will not comment.

The police chief in Logan Township, Pennsylvania, where the satellite campus he attended is located, told local reporters that Braham had discussed hazing at his fraternity with an aunt and with several friends. The case is under investigation by the state attorney general, but no charges have been filed. The fraternity was suspended. Penn State said it couldn't comment on Braham's death, because of his family's pending lawsuit, but admitted there are times when the university reaches out to parents to notify them of harmful situations.

""Emergency in this context includes mental health emergencies as well,"" university spokeswoman Lisa Powers said in an email. ""In general, and in accordance with privacy laws and practices, when we have a student emergency we balance the critical nature/seriousness of the situation with the student's privacy rights as we make the decision to contact parents, or not.""

Many universities say they alert parents of health risks, such as when a student contracts a contagious disease, but there is no such pattern of reporting when it comes to other potential threats, like hazing.

In addition to Hipps and Burch, there is the 2010 death of Samuel Mason, 20, who was allegedly made to drink a bottle of liquor in an hour while pledging Tau Kappa Epsilon at Radford University in Virginia. Radford University says that chapter of TKE had been found in violation of university policy earlier that year for serving alcohol to minors at a fraternity social event. His family sued and settled with the national fraternity and several of the local chapter's members.

And the death of Armando Villa, a 19-year-old at California State University-Northridge, pledging Pi Kappa Phi, who died during a hazing-related 18-mile August hike where, his family lawsuit alleges, he and other pledges weren't given enough water. His fraternity had been cited for not completing required education programs and for holding unregistered events, and had just been reinstated after a suspension when the hike took place. A spokesman for the family says his mother, Betty Serrato, didn't know about the suspension and says that if she had, she would have tried to talk her son out of pledging that fraternity.

Neither Radford or CSUN has sanctions posted on its website, although CSUN told CNN it is considering putting them online.

""It's sad. It's really sad,"" Kim Burch said. ""If we had known this was going on, we would have never let him join this fraternity. I never in my life thought I was sending a 17-year-old kid off to end up two months later gone. It's repulsive. He would have been better off joining the Marines and going to war.""",human
A bipartisan Buttigieg effect? The people of this gorgeous island country say yes,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Although American presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race this week, his hard-to-pronounce name has given US voters a lesson in phonetics.

While most US presidential candidates' pins and shirts bear names or slogans, Buttigieg's fans wore swag explaining the famously tricky pronunciation of his name. (Their shirts, pins and hats read ""Boot Edge Edge"" and ""Buddha Judge."")

Why was it so hard for Americans to sound out his name? One reason might be its origins. The name Buttigieg comes from Maltese, a language unlike any other on earth.

Related content How to pronounce Pete Buttigieg

""All languages draw from other languages,"" says Joseph Brincat, an expert in the history of the Maltese language and the author of ""Maltese and Other Languages: A Linguistic History of Malta.""

""Maltese draws not just from different languages but from three language families.""

The first of these language groups, Semitic, also includes Hebrew and Arabic. The other two, Romance and Germanic, are part of the large Indo-European language family. (French and Italian are both Romance languages; English, Dutch and Icelandic are all Germanic languages with a common ancestor.)

And while Maltese is considered a dialect of Arabic, Arabic speakers in nearby Tunisia and Libya can understand only 40% of spoken Maltese.

The written version, moreover, would be nearly impossible to parse. Dozens of Semitic languages are spoken across the Middle East and Africa, and they're written in scripts that range from the Hebrew alphabet to the rounded Ge'ez script used in Ethiopia. Alone among Semitic languages, Maltese is written in the Latin script employed by English and many other European languages.

How did this unique dialect of Arabic land on a Mediterranean island? During the Muslim conquest of the Mediterranean world starting in the 7th century AD, the language spread along with eastern technologies, ideas and foods.

Arabs arriving from Sicily invaded Malta in 870, deposing then-Byzantine rulers and seizing power for the next 200 years. While it's unknown exactly when Arabic took root in the islands, linguists believe modern-day Maltese is descended from a dialect of Arabic spoken in the Middle Ages.

The Midpoint of the Mediterranean

Surrounded by powdery beaches and rock formations, the country of Malta is an archipelago just south of Sicily, with three main islands that make up just 122 square miles.

Closer to the African cities of Tunis and Tripoli than it is to Rome, Malta is often called the midpoint of the Mediterranean, and for the seafaring powers that once grappled for power here that strategic location made the islands a sought-after prize.

A who's-who of conquerors in Malta would range from the ancient Romans to Napoleon, the Byzantines to the British. That history transformed the island's Mediterranean Arabic into something uniquely Maltese, a language imprinted by centuries of outside influence.

Now, says Brincat, more than half the vocabulary comes from Sicilian or Italian, with just a third reflecting the original Arabic. Malta was also part of the British Empire for more than 150 years, and some 8% of modern Maltese is drawn from English.

With such diverse influences, Maltese can be a mouthful. From a pronunciation perspective, however, the name Buttigieg is pretty basic.

(As an example of a more challenging word, the Professor proposed ÃÂ¦an GÃÂargÃÂur, a hilltop village whose name Brincat pronounced with a deft, throaty trill that sounds something like: ha ra raow.

A convergence of cultures

It's not just the language. The same power struggles that shaped Maltese are written in stone throughout the islands.

Visitors can explore that history in the capital city of Valletta, a World Heritage Site that UNESCO describes as ""one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world.""

Among the city's highlights is St. John's Co-Cathedral, a masterpiece of Baroque artwork and architecture. (A co-cathedral shares a bishop's seat with another church; in Malta, the main seat of the archdiocese is St. Paul's Cathedral in Mdina.)

Even the floor is exquisite. The co-cathedral's sanctuary is paved in brilliant-colored marble marking nearly 400 tombstones of Knights of Saint John, a religious order that founded Valletta and became militarized during the First Crusade to Jerusalem.

Just across the water from Valletta is Fort St. Angelo, which become a strategic stronghold for the Knights of Saint John when Ottoman troops laid siege to the island in 1565 for more than three months.

It was a particularly bloody episode in the running contest for power and faith in the Mediterranean, and it riveted Europe. ""If the Turks should prevail against the Isle of Malta,"" said England's Queen Elizabeth I, ""it is uncertain what further peril might follow to the rest of Christendom.""

In one grisly confrontation, the Ottoman army floated the headless bodies of Christian knights into Valletta's Grand Harbour in an attempt to demoralize enemy forces. Local Christians, in turn, decapitated Ottoman prisoners and loaded their heads into the cannons of Fort St. Angelo.

Today, a public holiday called Victory Day commemorates September 8th, 1565, when Ottoman invaders drew back, forever ending Malta's role in the struggle between Muslim and Christian forces.

Malta's ancient mysteries

That culture war is hundreds of years in the past, but compared to Malta's most ancient sites, the conflict between the Christian and Muslim worlds in this majority-Catholic country seems like recent history.

Built across the islands of Malta and Gozo are seven megalithic temples that are some of the oldest free-standing stone buildings on earth.

The temples, which together form a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are a mysterious window into the Bronze Age.

Step into the hilltop site of ÃÂ¦aÃÂ¡ar Qim, a temple built between 3200 and 3600 BC, and you'll enter a world aligned to the heavens. A chamber here is carved to admit a warm beam of sunshine on the summer solstice.

In the megalithic temples, bas-reliefs show images of the natural world, including plants, animals and trees. Within the temples, archeologists have found statues depicting corpulent women (PDF) , and some have speculated that the islands were a site of fertility- and goddess-worship.

Much about the ancient people who built these temples remain a mystery.

Linguists don't know what language was spoken here when megalithic temples were constructed across Malta in the 3rd and 4th millennia BC. Thousands of years after islanders erected sanctuaries honoring natural cycles, even their simplest words are lost to history.

The Buttigieg effect?

Today, the ancient Maltese can speak only through their stones. Modern Maltese people, however, have the ""Times of Malta,"" the country's most widely circulated paper.

The newspaper covered the Buttigieg primary campaign long before the former mayor of South Bend collected delegates in Iowa and New Hampshire. Language is front and center. One story described Buttigieg's own uphill efforts to explain the pronunciation of his name, which can be roughly translated to ""lord of the poultry.""

And recent coverage points to the benefits for Maltese-Americans of the ongoing conversations about their ancestral language. ""Malta has been living under the radar for so long,"" Maltese-American Joe Gauci told ""Times of Malta"" journalist Vanessa Conneely. ""People are discovering our diamond in the Mediterranean Sea.""

Some Maltese-Americans understood the candidate's struggles all too well. ""Growing up with the name Buttigieg was interesting,"" Michigan resident Lisa Buttigieg-LiGreci explained to Conneely. ""No one ever heard of it or could pronounce it.""

Conneely pointed to ""The Buttigieg Effect"" as a chance for Americans to finally learn the basics of Maltese. But even among the relatively small demographic of Maltese-Americans named ""Buttigieg,"" however, consensus is still hard to reach during the campaign. Lisa Buttigieg-LiGreci, for one, didn't approve of Mayor Pete's pronunciation of his own name.",human
Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights,"Story highlights Nikki Haley: Widespread human rights violations a warning sign that breakdown in security is coming

Syrian war just one example of how such violations can spiral into all-out war, she says

Ambassador Nikki R. Haley is the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) Imagine you are the parent of a boy -- a teenager. Policemen come to your home in the middle of the night and take your boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.

For a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents marched in protest to demand their children's release, security services opened fire on them. When more people came out to protest the killings, the government fired on them again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.

Nikki Haley

""We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children but their reply was bullets,"" a relative of one of the boys told a reporter . ""Now we can have no compromise with any security branches.""

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change,"Temujin Doran, CNN Thomas Page , CNN Written by

For an artist who deals in ephemera, Olafur Eliasson likes to take the long view. Outside the gallery, he fears humanity is transfixed on now at the expense of tomorrow -- and warns that obsession could be at the expense of the planet.

Eliasson has returned to London for what he calls his ""mid-career survey,"" assembling three decades of work, some new, in the Tate Modern for exhibition ""In Real Life."" It marks a spiritual return to the gallery that hosted what is perhaps still his crowning achievement, 2003's Turbine Hall installation ""The Weather Project.""

From suspended water droplets to restless light shows, the Icelandic-Danish artist has always placed transience at the heart of his elemental work. He bottles lightning, so to speak, so that we may appreciate its delicate majesty. And the delicacy of nature is coming into even sharper focus as the years pass.

An artist who says he's interested in the environment, rather than an environmental artist, visitors will see gathering momentum on the subject of climate change throughout his career. No more explicitly is this made than in ""Ice Watch,"" a glacial henge made of icebergs from Greenland, first created in 2014 and reprised in London in the lead up to his current show.

""Ice Watch"" (2018) by Olafur Eliasson and Minik Rosing. Credit: Charlie Forgham-Bailey

As our institutions drag their heels and reform is slow, he believes art has a crucial role to play in the public discourse.

""Politicians are getting increasingly obsessed with the immediate,"" he says. ""(Solutions to climate change) require long-term decisions, long-term investment, long-term planning. We need to see accountability by politicians, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years (into the future), long after the politician's dead and gone.""

He believes we have been let down by politicians and the private sector. ""I'm afraid we can't wait for them to do the work for us. Because they are not going fast enough,"" he argues. Civic society holds the answers, Eliasson suggests, and art can act as a great communicator within it.

""We get a lot of science ... but it's fair to say that it's often very disembodied,"" he explains. ""It is knowledge that doesn't have a physical sort of storage; there's no memory (of it) in our bodies... One of the things that art can do -- and it's not the only thing -- is it can sort of bring a physical narrative to something that one knows.""

A new work, ""The presence of absence pavilion,"" conveys one such narrative. A cast bronze sculpture molded around the negative space of glacial ice, it's a permanent memorial to a loss we seem incapable of stopping.

""I think we have a better ability to translate our critical enquiry into action once we have a physical relationship with the world,"" he says. ""Bringing an experiential narrative to knowledge ... gives you a certain empowerment.""

""We have a situation now where the whole planet has become conscious about (climate change). I think we see a trend how to translate our climate knowledge into climate actions. I hope it's the beginning we are seeing, and not the peak,"" Eliasson adds.

Art's slow churn is part of the medium's appeal for Eliasson. ""Sometimes the idea of a work of art is 10 years in the making, and it's 10 years in the arriving, and 10 years in the responding,"" he says, referring to no work in particular.

""Some communication has to be very slow, like philosophy, somehow. The world needs that too. I think what culture and art can offer is this slowness that also allows you to ask the bigger questions.""",human
Opinion | ItÃ¢ÂÂs a MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"And when it comes to the economy, Trump seems to fluctuate day to day Ã¢ÂÂ even hour to hour Ã¢ÂÂ between assertions that everything is fine and demands for enormous, ill-conceived stimulus.

His big idea for the economy is a complete payroll tax holiday. According to Bloomberg News, he told Republican senators that he wanted the holiday to extend Ã¢ÂÂthrough the November election so that taxes donÃ¢ÂÂt go back up before voters decide whether to return him to office.Ã¢ÂÂ That is, he apparently said the quiet part out loud.

This would be an enormous move. Payroll taxes are 5.9 percent of G.D.P.; by comparison, the Obama stimulus of 2009-2010 peaked at about 2.5 percent of G.D.P. Yet it would be very poorly targeted: big breaks for well-paid workers, nothing for the unemployed or those without paid sick leave.

Why do it this way? After all, if the goal is to put money in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs hands, why not just send out checks? Apparently Republicans canÃ¢ÂÂt conceive of an economic policy that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt take the form of tax cuts.

Trump also reportedly wants to provide aid to specific industries, including oil and shale Ã¢ÂÂ a continuation of his administrationÃ¢ÂÂs efforts to subsidize fossil fuels.

Democrats, by contrast, have proposed a package that would actually address the needs of the moment: free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, expanded unemployment benefits and an increase in federal matching funds for Medicaid programs, which would both help states meet the demands of the crisis and sustain overall spending by relieving the pressure on state budgets.

Notice, by the way, that these measures would help the economy in an election year, and therefore arguably help Trump politically. But Democrats are willing to do the right thing anyway Ã¢ÂÂ a stark contrast to the behavior of Republicans after the 2008 financial crisis, when they offered scorched-earth opposition to anything that might mitigate the damage.",human

Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus,"(CNN) This is a fact: Over the weekend, at Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump came into contact with a Brazilian press aide who was diagnosed Thursday with coronavirus.

Which leads us to another fact: The President of the United States has been exposed to coronavirus.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

Despite that indisputable reality, Trump has so far refused to be tested for the virus. Asked about the press aide's positive test on Thursday, Trump responded this way: ""Let's put it this way, I'm not concerned, OK?""

That's consistent with his reaction when informed that Reps. Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida had both interacted with a person who had tested positive for coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Committee.

""I don't think it's a big deal, I would do it, I don't feel any reason -- I feel extremely good,"" said Trump , adding he had ""no symptoms, no anything.""

That is a deeply irresponsible view for anyone -- much less the President of the United States -- to take.

(Side note: It also appears to be untrue. ""He is very concerned about all the people he met who have it, including the Brazilian,"" a source close to the President told CNN's Jim Acosta .)

Here's why: Trump is a 73-year-old man who we KNOW has been exposed to the virus. People who have coronavirus can be asymptomatic for days or even weeks -- and by continuing to carry on your normal daily life, you run the risk of infecting lots and lots of people if you do, in fact, have the virus.

What the country is currently in the process of is an attempt to ""flatten the curve"" on the infection rate, working to slow down the rate of spread in order to ensure that the medical community can keep up with the number of people who are sick, and ensure proper care for each and every one of them.

That's why schools are closed. The NBA is shuttered. And Broadway is dark. In order to contain this outbreak, we all have to adjust the ways in which we are used to living. That includes making sure that we are good members of the community -- and not accidentally spreading this virus to others, especially the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.

Leaders should know that. Leaders need to model the behavior -- even if it is uncomfortable -- that they need from the public. Leaders need to be the best of us.

At the moment, Trump is not doing that. He's doing the opposite. Given his documented exposure, it is absolutely reckless for him to continue his current, normal behavior without getting tested. On a daily basis, he is meeting with high-level officials across the government without knowing whether he is infecting them.

(It is, of course, possible that Trump has been tested and we haven't been told about it or the results aren't known yet. But that seems unlikely. And either way, medical recommendations would suggest he should be self-quarantining if he believes himself to have the virus.)

Geist: Just to piggyback on what Mika said, we know the President of the United States over the weekend at Mar-a-Lago himself was standing with and had physical contact with someone from Brazil who now has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Should the President himself be tested for coronavirus?

Fauci: I'd leave that to the President's physician. He -- they have a very good White House physician and physician staff there. So when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician.

Geist: But generally speaking if I were standing next to someone who had been diagnosed with coronavirus should I isolate myself and find a test as well?

Fauci: Yes.

So, yeah. Fauci is doing his best to avoid saying the President needs to be tested while also saying, effectively, the President needs to be tested.

The simple fact is this: It is crazy that Trump has seemingly not been tested for coronavirus. Absolutely crazy.",human
How to Use an Instant Pot,"How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?

Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.

A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers Ã¢ÂÂ stovetop and electric Ã¢ÂÂ are quite safe. They donÃ¢ÂÂt explode as your grandmotherÃ¢ÂÂs may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.

For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, theyÃ¢ÂÂre heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the potÃ¢ÂÂs temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isnÃ¢ÂÂt hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.

With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cookÃ¢ÂÂs having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And donÃ¢ÂÂt worry: It wonÃ¢ÂÂt explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.",human

What this will cost Mitch McConnell,"In this weekly column ""Cross-Exam,"" Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.

(CNN) Give Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this much: at least he's open and transparent about his plan to rig the upcoming Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. McConnell -- who will serve as both judge (in his capacity as majority leader to set the procedure before trial) and juror (as one of the 100 senators who will vote to convict or acquit Trump) -- came right out and said that he will work ""in total coordination with the White House counsel."" McConnell's disdain for even the appearance of a fair process is so pointed that it seems his end goal is to de-legitimize the upcoming trial before it begins.

McConnell is not the only future impeachment juror to have made rash statements about the upcoming trial. Senator Lindsey Graham, abandoning all pretext of impartiality, proudly declared that he's ""not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here."" And this tendency to pre-judge crosses party lines.

For example, Elizabeth Warren has stated that what Trump ""has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached.""

It is bad for the process when senators of either party publicly undermine their obligation to be impartial. But McConnell's conduct is worse than that. Each senator is one vote out of 100, but McConnell's pronouncement that he will totally coordinate with the White House is destructive to the underlying constitutional process we are about to see unfold.

An impeachment trial is different in many respects from a criminal trial, but the criminal process provides a useful point of reference. If a person in McConnell's position -- judge or juror -- tried to coordinate with a party to a criminal case, he would be thrown off the case, disciplined and potentially prosecuted for obstruction of justice. While this isn't a criminal case, McConnell's comments show his disregard for the weight of the moment.

It is hard to miss that McConnell's pronouncement comes with a note of glee. Far from being secretive or apologetic about his coordination with the White House, he has come right out and boasted about it. It seems his cynical bottom line goal is to de-legitimize the process -- to promote the broad public view that the Senate trial is not a meaningful truth-finding exercise but rather empty political theater. His remarks seem designed to elicit a dismayed shake of the head and then a ""what are you gonna do?"" shrug from the populace. McConnell likely will get what he wants -- a quick acquittal of Trump -- but only at the long-term cost of public confidence in the integrity of our political and legal processes.

Now, your questions

Vignesh (New Jersey): What is the significance of the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the cases relating to Trump's tax returns?

The Supreme Court last week granted certiorari (meaning, in plain English, it ""agreed to review"") Trump's efforts to block disclosure of his tax returns. The court consolidated three separate cases for its consideration -- two involving congressional subpoenas and a third involving a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney's office, all served on private companies handling Trump's personal finances.

This is a temporary win for Trump. In all three cases, both the trial-level federal district courts and the intermediate level courts of appeals have ruled against Trump and upheld the subpoenas. Had the Supreme Court declined to review the cases, those courts of appeals rulings would have become final, and Trump's tax returns would have been disclosed to Congress and the district attorney.

But, longer term, the ruling might prove to be more of a reprieve for Trump than a win. It would take quite a reversal for the Supreme Court to find that all the lower courts got it wrong -- though, as the nation's highest arbiter, the court certainly can and does overturn lower courts as it sees fit.

Some speculate that it is a good sign for Trump that the Supreme Court agreed to take the case. The court requires four votes (out of nine justices) to grant review. So, the thinking might go, we can assume at least four justices felt a need to take the cases and prevent the lower court rulings from taking effect, signaling an inclination to reverse.

On the other hand, it could be that four (or more) justices voted to take the cases because they recognized the enormous constitutional stakes presented by an inter-branch dispute between Congress and the White House (in the two Congressional cases) and between a state prosecutor and the federal executive branch (in the Manhattan district attorney office's case).

We will get a ruling from the court by June 2020 at the latest. The decision therefore could hit right in the heart of presidential campaign season. Depending on the outcome, the ruling could be either an embarrassing rebuke (and potentially worse) to Trump, or a vindication of his long-claimed right to withhold his personal financial information from Congress and prosecutors.

Tom (Colorado): Will the representatives and senators vote on each article of impeachment separately, or will there be one vote for both articles?

When the full House votes later this week on the two pending articles of impeachment against Trump, each member will vote separately on each article. Similarly, at the conclusion of a Senate trial, each Senator will vote yes or no on each article.

So it won't be an all-or-nothing proposition. Some members of Congress might split their votes -- likely with some members voting ""yes"" on Article I (Abuse of Power relating to Ukraine) but ""no"" on Article II (Obstruction of Congress), reasoning that Trump's defiance of congressional subpoenas is less serious or more defensible than his attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

While not likely, we could end up with a split outcome, with one article passing and the other failing in the House. That type of split decision happened in the Bill Clinton impeachment in 1998. The House Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment, but the full House approved two while rejecting two others.

Gary (New York): Who serves as the defense lawyers and prosecutors in a Senate impeachment trial?

The President can hire any attorneys who are willing to put forward his defense. During the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial, a team comprised of White House counsel and private attorneys defended the President on the Senate floor. Similarly here, it appears Trump will go with White House Counsel Pat Cipollone as his lead attorney, plus reportedly outside attorneys including former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Senate Democrats call for more sanctions against 'Putin's chef' following CNN investigation,"(CNN) Senate Democrats have called on the European Union to introduce fresh sanctions against Yevgeny Prighozin, the man believed to behind many Russian troll operations, as a result of the CNN investigation that published Thursday and exposed a Russian troll farm in Ghana.

Five leading senators signed the letter calling for coordinated sanctions against Prigozhin.

""As the presidential election in the United States draws closer, our concerns about foreign interference here have intensified,"" the senators write. ""These threats, however, are not limited to the United States Ã¢ÂÂ given the broad reach and expanding nature of Prigozhin and the Wagner Group's malign activities abroad, we urge the European Union to take steps to constrain their ability to operate and to deter the Kremlin from engaging in these activities.""

""The U.S. and European Union should be unified in facing this common threat and take concrete measures to isolate this malign actor and his affiliated firms. This includes sanctions, but also a joint diplomatic approach to urge that countries avoid engaging with Mr. Prigozhin, Wagner and any other organization associated with him.""

On Thursday, CNN revealed that a Russian troll farm based out of Ghana and Nigeria was operating under the front of an NGO called EBLA, Eliminating Barriers for the Liberation of Africa.

A little more than a month later, the country has reported at least 1,920 cases in 48 states and the District of Columbia.

At least 41 people have died: 31 in Washington state, four in California, two in Florida, and one each in Georgia, Kansas, New Jersey and South Dakota.

As local leaders work to curb the spread of the virus within the US, health officials say they expect the number of cases to keep climbing as more people are tested.

The 1,920 people in the US who have tested positive includes 46 who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan; 21 repatriated from the Grand Princess cruise ship stuck for days off California; and three repatriated from Wuhan, China.

How virtual reality is changing the live music experience,"London (CNN Business) Just because your favorite band's live show sold out in minutes, it doesn't mean you have to miss out.

In the last few years, musicians have been able to stream concerts to virtual reality headsets, allowing fans to enjoy the virtual spectacle from the comfort of their homes. Now some VR platforms are going beyond just recreating the live experience, by offering viewpoints and interactions that users could never get if they were at the venue.

Launched in 2018, MelodyVR has built a library of live shows, recorded for streaming to Oculus VR headsets or iPhone and Android devices through its app at a later date. It says it has worked with more than 850 musicians, including Kelly Clarkson, Wiz Khalifa and Lewis Capaldi.

Singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi filmed an exclusive session for MelodyVR.

As well as being able to watch from a position in the audience, users can view the concerts as if they were backstage, behind the sound booth, or even on stage with the band. The company has also created more novel experiences; a VR performance by British singer Emeli SandÃÂ© displays two images of her simultaneously, one playing the piano and the other singing.

This year, MelodyVR plans to begin offering live streaming via a paid-for virtual ticket, and has designed its own cameras for the task.",human
"Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up","London (CNN) President Donald Trump's shock announcement shutting down travel from much of Europe came with the customary back-pedaling common to many of his hastily announced initiatives.

At first, Trump said trade and travel would be targeted, in his latest attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus, staunch market losses and shore up his image as an effective leader. But aides quickly clarified that trade would not be affected, and officials said his plan did not apply to Americans or US permanent residents -- although such travelers would face mandatory quarantines.

While the President has taken shots at Europe's trade policies in the past, it doesn't seem as if he is trying to take competitive advantage of this situation. However that doesn't mean it won't be perceived that way. Implying the coronavirus outbreak in the US is a problem caused by foreigners will smack to many around the world as more of his isolationist US First policies.

His decision will leave an uncomfortable feeling in many European capitals that the transatlantic relationship that Trump has been slowly unpicking for the past few years is about to unravel at an even faster rate.

And while coronavirus is set to exacerbate existing global tensions, some countries, China and Russia in particular, have already been exploiting it.

This week China's President Xi Jinping took a tour of Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, congratulating medical workers on their great job treating tens of thousands of citizens.

That he did it via video link hints that his confidence that the contagion is under total control is not rock solid; but the fact that he is making a big deal of China apparently shaking off the outbreak reveals he is eyeing the opportunities it creates.

Searching for advantage

Russia's President Vladimir Putin also seems to have the same grasp of how the virus can work to his benefit. This week as oil prices collapsed, a calamity he had a hand in, he moved swiftly to cement his grip on power, a plan he's had in his back pocket for years.

In China, by the estimates of the World Health Organization, Xi has pulled off a herculean task in containing the virus, albeit one his own officials allowed to blossom, but it has come at a price.

Where much of the world sees calamity in the coronavirus, Xi has been searching for advantage. Everything is at stake for him: his political leadership at home, China's economy, its position as a world power and ultimately Xi's own strut on the world stage.

No surprise then that he has sought to rehabilitate China's image, casting its response to the virus as one of success from which other countries can learn from. A book published late last month by the government -- in a variety of different languages -- recounts how China won the ""people's war"" against the disease, ""under the centralized and unified leadership of the Communist Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core.""

China's state media has been similarly effusive, skirting over the government's initial missteps and instead focusing on China's alleged ""strength, efficiency and speed in fighting the outbreak.""

But if Xi is using coronavirus to embellish his own credentials, in Moscow Putin is using it to execute both internal and external ambitions.

How all nations weather the virus will be measured by lasting damage to their economies. It is the horrible balance that faces all leaders today, how many lives to lose versus the cost to the economy.

Force everyone to stay home and stop the virus spreading but crash the economy, bury businesses in so much debt they'll never resurface or wait until the last minute, whenever that maybe, and minimize economic pain at a likely cost of the death of many retirees. It's an ugly equation that autocrats seem best placed to play.

Carefully crafted message

Putin chose to make his big move on ""Black Monday,"" the day oil markets crashed off the back of OPEC's failure to agree (with Russia) how to handle the coronavirus crimping oil demand. He announced plans to break Russian presidential term limits and hold on to power until 2036, meaning he will have been in charge for more than a third of a century.

It's been no secret that Putin has been planning to hold power past his current term ending 2024. When he signaled a few months ago he was shifting a few presidential powers to parliament, the world jumped to attention with analysts trying to figure its meaning: an unstable Russia is a big threat to the rest of the world.

Putin works best in the shadows; international scrutiny risks damaging his own carefully crafted domestic media message. He brooks no meaningful dissent, and massages Russian's view of himself and the world.

A distraction on the scale of ""Black Monday"" provided him with the perfect cover to drop his message and minimize international attention. It worked, but it wasn't his only power play this past week.

Coronavirus gave him another opportunity. At the OPEC summit in Vienna last Friday he refused Saudi Arabia's plan to cut oil production, preferring instead to maintain current levels, see the price fall and hurt US shale oil producers whose product is more costly to extract than Russia's crude oil.

Russia is doing better than Trump's America at limiting the onset of the coronavirus -- if the figures that Moscow have released are accurate. Not for the first time Putin is proving more astute than Trump, not just dodging the disease, but taking geopolitical advantage from it.

Xi for sure will be looking for gains at the expense of America too and he has the advantage of apparently being on the leading edge of recovery. So however badly hit his economy is, and however suppressed China's international market will be for months to come, Xi is the one with the advantage just at the moment.

Trump looking flat-footed

Trump on the other hand is at the edge of the coronavirus precipice: the US economy risks a steep fall, triggered in part by downplaying the health threat while focusing on the protective powers of America's economic resilience. And his latest scramble to restrict European travelers is unlikely to catapult Trump out of coronavirus trouble.

Compared to Putin and Xi today, Trump is looking flat-footed. Xi messed up in the beginning but has countered with a massive crackdown on movement that Trump lacks the technology or the strong arm tactics to achieve.

And it's clear that the longer the US or any other nation is affected by the virus the longer it will take to recover economically. Take Italy, with the whole nation under quarantine: it lacks the extreme powers of China to contain and control the population, and is already the poorest of the G7, the group of leading world economies, and could face challenges to stay at the top table.

While experts predict most economies will recover, some countries, perhaps less able than Italy, will be susceptible to the machinations of less well-intentioned nations.

Russia has wanted to be back in the G7, formerly the G8, since it was thrown out in 2014 for invading Ukraine, and indeed Italy has been one of the loudest advocates for Russia's re-admission.

How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus,"The coronavirus is here, and itÃ¢ÂÂs showing no signs of letting up. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to keep your hands clean and off your face, but itÃ¢ÂÂs hard to maintain constant vigilance.

Keeping your phone sanitized is another smart way to keep germs off your fingertips. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers your phone a Ã¢ÂÂhigh-touch surface,Ã¢ÂÂ which could make it a carrier of the virus.

But cleaning your phone Ã¢ÂÂ thoroughly, I mean Ã¢ÂÂ is not as straightforward as it might seem. There are all sorts of nooks and crannies, delicate glass and intricate protective cases.

Coronavirus shows up Trump's compassion deficit,"(CNN) White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham says that in this time of coronavirus it'll be business as usual for Donald Trump. He's not going to cancel any rallies or worry much at all about whether he's been exposed to infection, it seems. ""And I'll tell you what,"" she says , ""with our President, this man who doesn't sleep and who I have seen work 15, 16 hours a day every day, I have no problem thinking that he is going to be just fine and just healthy.""

If Grisham had been concerned about the American public, she might not have talked about how attending big public events, working yourself to the bone, and skipping sleep is a reasonable response to the threat the virus poses to us all. In fact, if this is what Trump is doing, it's the opposite of what is recommended for an obese , largely sedentary man of 73.

With any other president, we'd all be wondering what got into an aide who strained so hard to suggest the boss is some sort of superman, but this is Trump we're talking about. The man's narcissism and propensity for rage are well documented and Grisham was obviously playing to both qualities.

Long a subject of press reports, Trump's anger has been evidenced as he has fired cabinet members, chiefs of staff -- Mick Mulvaney, who never even got the chance to shed the ""acting"" in front of the title was dismissed just last weekend -- and those who testified about him during his impeachment. Administration officials are generally worried about delivering bad news to the boss for fear of how he'll respond. When a CDC official recently noted, correctly, that a coronavirus outbreak was inevitable in the US, Politico reported that Trump got so angry officials discussed ordering her to stop making public statements. (They eventually decided against this.)

Having made the point that Trump isn't changing anything, Grisham stayed true to the President's why-worry attitude. When she went the further step, to explain that he's an extraordinary specimen who doesn't need sleep and can work rings around mere mortals she played to the vanity that is his other defining characteristic. As Grisham and other administration survivors seem to know (I'm looking at you, Vice President Mike Pence), you can never go wrong by putting the President at the center of every discussion and slathering him with praise.

In the current crisis, the problem is not so much the President's overweening self-regard but his inability to recognize the needs of others. This problem, invariably a characteristic of the truly narcissistic, makes it difficult if not impossible for someone to put others first. In families, it can be evidenced by the parent who buys himself a new car when the rent is overdue. In countries, it is seen when a leader can't seem to see what people need in a moment of crisis.

Whether he's throwing paper towels into a crowd amid death and devastation in Puerto Rico or mocking victims of sexual assault, Trump has shown himself to be callous with enough regularity that he has taught us to cringe when we see him in a moment where concern for others is required. Remember how he joked about crowd sizes when he visited a hospital after a mass shooting in El Paso? How about the time, at the beginning of his term, when he stood at a memorial for fallen intelligence officers and bragged about his own intellect

Compassion, which is the opposite of narcissism, is as essential to the presidency as any trait and presidents of both parties have shown it often. We all remember the moving responses from Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W. Bush after the attacks of 9/11 and Barack Obama after the Charleston church shooting. It is something we have relied on from our leaders. It is also the piece so often missing from Trump's response to difficult times. This is the man, who, a Huffington Post video showed, needed an e motional cheat sheet for a meeting with survivors of school shootings. That the prompts encouraged him to say, ""I hear you,"" is all the evidence we need to know that the White House staff recognizes that the President struggles when it comes to compassion.

Why is Trump like this? When I wrote a biography of him I learned that he was raised by a role model father who showed his son little of the sort of tenderness that would produce concern for others in a child. His education was guided by a military school drill sergeant who was toughness personified, and his introduction to the adult world was shaped by the well-known character assassin Roy Cohn. Given these mentors, and all the insecurity that came with being a rich kid playing with daddy's money, Trump was all but destined to be the man we see today. He is angry and narcissistic, and the best those around him can do is coddle him in the hopes that he won't make things worse.",human
New 'Jungle Bubbles' invite travelers to sleep next to elephants in Thailand's Golden Triangle,"Chiang Rai, Thailand (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Elephants don't sleep much. They eat loudly. They pass gas loudly, too.

The two transparent domes sit next to a large enclosure inhabited by three rescued elephants, which are cared for by the resort's Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation

Related content 20 stunning new Asia Pacific luxury hotels to check into in 2020

Guests can sit back and watch as these female elephants play with the strategically placed ""toys"" that hang from large trees, their powerful trunks occasionally ripping off huge chunks of bark and branches, sending loud cracks through the evening air.

But really, they mainly just want to eat.

Thankfully, a hefty supply of sugar cane is placed within eyesight of the bubbles, meaning the elephants are almost always just a few steps away.

Once-in-a-lifetime experience

l e v a r t

The bubbles are booked as an ""experience"" in addition to your reserved resort room, for 17,700 baht (US$563) per night per couple. This means you can just pack an overnight bag and leave the rest of your belongings in your suite.

Guests are picked up from the lobby just before sunset, then driven down a dirt road in an open-air jeep before taking a short walk through the resort's rice paddy to get to the bubbles.

Shortly after arrival, staff deliver an evening picnic basket, filled with pre-selected sandwiches and other cold dishes, allowing you to eat alongside the animals. There's a strict ""no hands"" policy when it comes to the elephants though -- bubble guests are not allowed to touch or feed them.

So how comfortable are the bubbles?

Each air-conditioned, pressurized 22-square-meter space is a mini slice of luxury, furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. There's a small washroom with a toilet and shower, along with a couple of chairs and a small table near the bed. No TVs here -- the elephants are the star of this show.

Sensitive sleepers will find It particularly surreal. As night passed during a recent visit, the moon made its way over the bubble, offering various levels of illumination. (Eye masks are provided as it can be surprisingly bright.)

Given these ladies don't nod off much -- elephants in captivity sleep only 4-6 hours a day -- you'll hear all sorts of delightful sounds throughout the night and might find yourself crawling out of bed for a late-night peek.

The bed features wrap-around curtains, offering privacy for those who worry they won't wake up before the caretakers arrive with the elephants' breakfast.

Trial and error

The idea for the ""Jungle Bubbles"" came from General Manager GaudÃÂ©ric Harang, who has been with the resort for about a year and a half. He says they were born of a desire to push the boundaries and offer a unique guest experience in line with modern luxury expectations.

In addition to safety concerns -- ""making sure our bubbles would be elephant proof"" -- he says they had to meet very high standards.

""As a top notch resort, we had to ensure the experience would be very luxurious and to the level of what is expected by our guests,"" he explains.

Once the bubbles were set up, Harang was the first to trial them.

""Being in the north of Thailand, we are lucky to have a climate that's more varied than in the rest of the country,"" he says. ""Though short, we go through a winter season that is very cold. When the bubbles were finally ready [in December] it was 6 degrees Celsius in the morning and...well I froze!

""There was no heater. Also, being located in the jungle there is a lot of humidity so the bubbles were very wet at night due to all the condensation. So, I woke up at 3 a.m., soaked and cold.""

As a result, the bubbles are now equipped with an air conditioner, space heater and dehumidifier to ensure a comfortable climate for all seasons.

""When I finally saw the bubbles in place I was so happy it all worked out, but I think I was only really impressed when I slept in it the second time [after the climate issues were sorted],"" he recalls, telling CNN Travel it was truly a ""wow"" moment.

""When you finally live it, you see it's really a fantastic experience. We couldn't have planned it better.""

The right elephants for the job

Picking the right elephants for the Jungle Bubbles experience was another logistical issue that needed to be sorted, says John Roberts, Anantara's Director of Elephants.

Besides size considerations -- how many elephants could comfortably live on the available plot of land? -- they also had to decide which of the camp's elephants would enjoy being together in the enclosure. Turns out, even elephants can get into tiffs with their friends -- just like humans but with an additional 3.5 tonnes of weight to throw around.

The three elephants in the Jungle Bubbles enclosure all arrived at the resort between 2006-2010, so Roberts and his team already had ample time to get familiar with their temperaments.

""We watched them for a long time,"" says Roberts. ""We know that they like being together -- actually [two of them] are pretty much inseparable at this stage and if you try and separate them they get pretty stressed.""

Offering a better life to captive elephants

Anantara's nonprofit Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation (GTAEF), founded in 2006 and overseen by Roberts, cares for about two dozen elephants.

Most of the animals have led hard lives -- some spent their days walking the streets of Bangkok with their owners, making money begging from tourists. Others came from tourist trekking camps.

The way the program works is the foundation invites mahouts (elephant trainers/owners) and their families to move to Chiang Rai with their elephants and live in the foundation's camp.

The foundation offers them a wage, which includes the cost of care for their elephants. This amounts to about $18,000 per elephant per year.

Roberts acknowledges that in a perfect world all elephants would be roaming free in the wild but the situation is incredibly complex.

""Unfortunately, you can't release elephants in Thailand,"" he says, rattling off a long list of complications including fears of disease transmission, potential conflict in a fragile wild herd and an inability for domesticated elephants to fend for themselves given they've spent most if not all of their lives in captivity. And then there are Thailand's laws, which would also need to be changed.

Thailand's domesticated elephants are all registered under the Draft Animals Act, so ""if you put a captive elephant in a national park you're officially illegally grazing your livestock and that's the law as it is,"" says Roberts.

As an alternative, the GTAEF aims to improve the welfare of captive elephants through various programs not just at its resort but throughout the region -- including mahout training -- while also taking part in conservation and wild elephant programs.

At the resort's elephant camp, this means figuring out the elephants' personalities though science and observation and matching them with activities that suit them -- an essential part of their well-being. For instance, elephants that are comfortable around strangers take part in the peaceful ""Walking with Giants"" experience.

""In the wild their entire lives are based around walking long distances and finding food,"" says Roberts. ""They have big brains, you have to keep them stimulated doing different things. You could just put them out there in a field, but they'll stand in one spot all day.""

Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary,"(CNN) They were among the rarest giraffes to walk the planet, and now they are gone.

The remains of two stunning white giraffes that lived at a Kenyan wildlife sanctuary were found in a skeletal state, rangers at the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy said on Tuesday.

The mother giraffe and her calf were killed by poachers, they said. The Kenya Wildlife Service was called to the reserve after it was reported the giraffes hadn't been seen in quite a while.

Upon finding the bones, wildlife officials estimated they had been there for at least four months.

""This is a very sad day for the community of Ijara and Kenya as a whole. We are the only community in the world who are custodians of the white giraffes,"" said Mohammed Ahmednoor, manager of the reserve in Garissa County, Kenya, in a news release .

Flu leaves a 4-year-old girl blind in Iowa,"(CNN) A 4-year-old girl in Iowa nearly died and is now blind because of the flu, and her parents have a message: Get your child vaccinated.

""If I can stop one child from getting sick, that's what I want to do,"" said Amanda Phillips. ""It's terrible to see your child suffer like this.""

Jade DeLucia, who did not receive a flu shot this season, caught the flu a few days before Christmas and spent nearly two weeks in the intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital.

""She is lucky to be alive,"" said one of her physicians, Dr. Theresa Czech . ""She's a little fighter. And I think she's super lucky.""

Her parents, who've missed work to care for Jade and face medical bills, have started a GoFundMe page

Every year, dozens of children die from the flu, and most of them had not received a flu shot, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Thousands more children are hospitalized.

Many of those who becomes seriously ill or died were perfectly healthy before they contracted the flu.

Jade is one of them.

'It's a little bug'

On December 19, Phillips noticed that Jade wasn't quite her usually bubbly self.

""She'd say, 'Mom, I don't feel good,' and we'd cuddle on the couch,"" Phillips remembers.

A few times over the next several days, Jade spiked a low-grade fever. Medicine brought it down easily, and she went back to playing with her older sister, Catalina.

""She was running around, having fun, eating normally, asking for snacks,"" her mother remembers. ""It was just -- it's a little bug, she'll get over it.""

Phillips thinks back to those four days, December 19 through December 23, and wracks her brain for something that might have told her what was about to happen.

""There wasn't any sign that would've told me that something was seriously wrong with her,"" she said.

'We have to go to the emergency room'

The night of December 23, while Phillips was working her shift as an assistant manager at a Dollar General store, Jade's father, Stephen DeLucia, tucked Jade into bed.

The next morning, the family was ready to leave the house to spend Christmas Eve with Phillips' parents. But Jade hadn't yet woken up.

When her father went to check on her, Jade was lying in bed, unresponsive. And her body was burning hot.

""I yelled at him -- I was like, 'We have to go. We have to go to the emergency room. This isn't right. Something's not right with her,"" Phillips said.

When they arrived at Covenant Medical Center, Jade's body started shaking uncontrollably, and her eyes rolled to the back of her head.

She was having a seizure.

Doctors filled the room. They said Jade needed to be transferred to the children's hospital at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, about 80 miles away. There was no time for an ambulance. She would have to be flown.

Her parents watched the helicopter take off.

""I didn't think I was going to see her again at that point,"" Phillips said. ""I really didn't. Just from looking at her, I really honestly didn't think I was going to see her.""

Bad news on Christmas Day

On Christmas Day, Phillips and DeLucia found out flu had affected her brain.

Called encephalopathy, it's a known complication of the flu, according to the CDC

Doctors showed Jade's parents the MRI results. Her brain was ""lit up like a Christmas tree,"" her mother remembers.

""They said she had significant brain damage. They said our child might not ever wake up, and if she did, she might not ever be the same,"" she said.

Over the next few days, Jade remained almost completely unresponsive.

Czech, a pediatric neurologist, was brought in to consult on Jade's case. On December 31, she told Jade's parents her specific diagnosis: acute necrotizing encephalopathy , or ANE, a type of encephalopathy usually caused by a viral infection.

ANE is so rare there are few studies on how children fare. Czech found one study that looked at four children with ANE. Three of them died.

""It's been 7 days. 7 days of it feeling like Jade was slipping away and that there was no hope. No hope of her ever coming back to us,"" her mother wrote on Facebook that day. ""All because of the flu.""

Czech prescribed steroids to calm the swelling in her brain.

And finally, Jade's parents received some good news.

A New Year's gift

CNN visited Jade's family on January 1. Her family started the new year with a prayer.

""Heavenly father will you wrap your angels around Jade this morning and throughout the day and pray for healing today,"" the prayer went.

Then, they visited Jade at the hospital -- and her mother came out beaming.

What had seemed so unlikely had happened: Jade woke up.

""She's got her eyes open. She's looking around. We got a couple of hand squeezes! And then we got a smile!"" she said.

Over the next few days, Jade kept getting better and better. Her breathing tube came out. She could sit up. She could eat -- and specifically requested chocolate pudding.

""Jade said 'Hi mommy' and you guys I'm a mess,"" Phillips wrote on Facebook on January 5.

But then Jade's parents and doctors noticed something.

Flu causes blindness

When her mother put Jade's favorite stuffed animal -- a white unicorn -- in front of her face, she didn't look at it.

When she threw a little ball, she didn't watch it as it went up in the air.

An ophthalmologist came in and examined Jade's eyes. Everything looked fine.

The problem wasn't with her eyes. It was with her brain, which had suffered because of the flu.

""It affected the part of her brain that perceives sight, and we don't know if she's going to get her vision back,"" said Czech, Jade's neurologist. ""In about three to six months from now we'll know. Whatever recovery she has at six months, that's likely all she's going to get.""

Jade might also have cognitive or developmental problems, such as learning disabilities, Czech added. She said that would be determined in the months and years to come.

But considering that Jade arrived at the hospital unresponsive on Christmas Eve, Czech is amazed at her progress.

""I think she's doing fabulous,"" she said.

Jade's homecoming

Jade went home January 9.

One of the first things she did was touch her sister's face and then pulled her close and cried.

Relieved to have her daughter back home, Phillips wants to get a message to other families about the flu shot.

Last March, when Jade's sister had her annual well visit at the pediatrician, both girls received a flu shot. Phillips says she thought that shot was good for an entire year. She didn't realize she needed to get the girls vaccinated again for the new 2019-2020 flu season.

Since the flu virus changes year to year, the vaccine also changes. Flu vaccines become available at the end of the summer, and the CDC recommends getting one by the end of October to protect against flu in the upcoming winter.

This year, the flu has been particularly tough on children. That's because the predominant virus has been influenza B, which affects children more than adults. So far, 32 children in the United States have died from flu this season, 21 from the influenza B strain of the virus.

""We want parents to know they should get a flu shot every season,"" Phillips said.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

It's true that the flu vaccine is only about 40-60% effective at preventing the flu, according to the CDC

But that's not the point, says Dr. Adam Ratner , a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health in New York City.

What parents need to know is that a vaccine is very effective at preventing children from becoming so sick from flu that there are life-threatening complications, like Jade did.

A 2014 study showed that flu vaccine reduced a child's risk of being admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit by 74%. A 2017 study showed the vaccine also significantly reduced a child's risk of dying from the flu, according to the CDC

""I'm less interested in whether the vaccine prevents all cases of runny noses and feeling cruddy and having to stay home from school because of the flu,"" Ratner said. ""That's no fun, but you get the vaccine not so much to prevent that as to prevent the chances of having a horrible complication of the flu.""

Back in Iowa, Phillips and DeLucia are settling into their new normal with Jade, Phillips writing on Facebook on her daughter's first night home: ""My brave girl, who cannot see, but is loved by so many.""",human
The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"Written by Rhonda Garelick, CNN

Sometimes, fashion's greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.

Ginsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those ""disappeared"" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.

Today, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.

Beyond a feminizing touch

Given her historic position and stature -- she's the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.

In adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.

Beyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.

There is her favorite ""majority"" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her ""dissenting"" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in ""Ruth"") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her ""dissenting"" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).

When espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.

When worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.

But those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not ""wear"" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least""straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as ""mind"" or ""spirit,"" while women represent the baser realms of ""body"" and ""flesh.""

Re-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes

To clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.

This risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.

Ginsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of ""body"" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.

To re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most ""noticeable"" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).

Ginsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.

And finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.

This has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary ""RBG"" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg's judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in ""RBG drag,"" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: ""Imagine yourself here! This could be you!""

Of course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.

Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure,"Amsterdam (CNN) From its base in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam, a confectionery company is doing its bit to fight modern-day slavery.

Its unconventional weapon of choice? A rich range of chocolate products.

""We are a funny company,"" says Henk Jan Beltman, chief chocolate officer at Tony's Chocolonely.

""The reason that we are a company is not that we want to sell chocolate and not that we want to make money."" Instead, Beltman adds: ""We want to make the world a nicer place.""

Tony's Chocolonely is one of many companies dedicated to producing what's known as Fair Trade chocolate by providing better prices to farmers and slave free working conditions.

Each bar is marketed with a promise to the consumer that no slave labor was used in the making of its chocolate.

Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Chocolate is a huge global industry, but cocoa beans, which are used to make chocolate, are grown by some of the poorest people on the planet, in plantations that can hide the worst forms of child labor. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: 2015 report found that more than two million children were working in ""hazardous"" conditions in the cocoa industry in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.

Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Although It is Fair Trade certified, Tony's says that certification alone is not enough.

Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: ""We only work with 7,000 farmers. We are a tiny company,"" says Tony's Chocolonely's chief chocolate officer Henk Jan Beltman. ""But if we can do it then the big guys can do it as well."" Hide Caption 7 of 7

The cocoa sector, worth more than $100 billion per year, has long battled with poor labor practices and forms of exploitation.

A 2015 report from Tulane University and the U.S. Department of Labor found that more than two million children were working in what it defined as ""hazardous"" conditions in the cocoa industry in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.

According to the World Fair Trade Organization, one of the 10 guiding principles of the Fair Trade movement is to ensure good working conditions and ensure no forced labor has been used in the manufacture of any product.

Yet Tony's Chocolonely believes the industry can further address this issue and that chocolate no longer needs to be a guilty pleasure.

Beltman says, ""If you look at certification like the Rainforest Alliance or Fair Trade or UTZ, those are all good but they don't manufacture a product ... and as a product owner you feel responsibility and it's your responsibility to sell something you can be proud of.

""Whether it's fish or phones or chocolate bars, it's always the owner who is responsible for the stuff that they sell ... and a certification body is never going to take that responsibility away.""

Art of the chocolatier

Its recipe for slave free chocolate starts on its cocoa farms.

By focusing on the fine details of its supply chain, Tony's Chocolonely says it traces the origin of the cocoa it buys -- all the way from the beans purchased directly from its farm cooperatives in West Africa to the finished product.

Yet it hasn't been working alone. Industry giant Barry Callebaut has become a strategic partner.

At its factory in the town of Wieze, Belgium, Barry Callebaut has built a system that isolates Tony's Chocolonely product.

Plant director, Xavier De Buysscher, says Tony's Chocolonely beans are treated, roasted and segregated. Its liquid chocolate is stored into a separate tank.

Once this process is complete, the product is molded by Belgian chocolate masters, Althea, which stamps an ethical message into each bar.

The unequal shape of the end product reflects inequality in the world and outlines the West African countries that supply the beans.

This detail is in keeping with the Tony's Chocolonely marketing strategy, to remind the consumer how and why the company began.

Life on the plantation

In 2003, Dutch journalists behind popular show ""The Consumer Investigation Agency"" exposed the trafficking of boys from Burkina Faso to the Ivory Coast, interviewing former slaves about life on the cocoa plantations.

The production team proposed to their audience that by eating chocolate all were complicit in slavery. After gathering testimonies from those who had been enslaved, reporter Teun Van De Keuken, unsuccessfully attempted to get himself arrested by the Dutch authorities to emphasize the point.

Three years later, determined to prove chocolate could be made slave-free, the journalists founded Tony's Chocolonely.

Now run by an executive team, the original founders have left the company. But cocoa labor abuses remain in the headlines.

The 2015 Tulane University report said the number of child laborers in cocoa production in Ghana and the Ivory Coast had increased by 13% from the time the last study had been conducted five years before.

It also cited endemic poverty as a major reason trafficking and unethical labor practices flourish in the region.

Taste of success

According to Beltman, Tony's Chocolonely operation has been hugely successful so far.

""We launched as a journalist initiative ... but all of a sudden by sending out the message people were buying the product and talking about [it],"" Beltman says.

""We hit one million euro ($1.1 million) revenue in the first year. This year we aim to hit around $50 million in revenue.""

Yet it's not just rising profitability that points to success at Tony's Chocolonely.

The fact that its methods have been fruitful is equally satisfying for all at the company.

""We only work with 7,000 farmers. We are a tiny company. But if we can do it then the big guys can do it as well,"" Beltman says. ""Then we solve the problem of slavery in the value chain of cocoa.""

""I'm gonna push as hard as we can to actually force other companies to work in the same way. There is no one in the world who wants to enjoy chocolate that comes from a source that's enslaved,"" he adds.",human

Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks,"(CNN) Perhaps nothing illustrates the wide-ranging effects the novel coronavirus has had on the United States as the state it left major US sports in on Thursday.

By the afternoon, most professional leagues and the governing body of major college sports had canceled or postponed a slew of games and major events. Some elected to go ahead -- without fans in the stands.

""This is time for big events like March Madness, big events like these big sports arena things to take a pause for the next four to six to eight weeks,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said at a House Oversight Committee hearing in Washington, ""while we see what happens with this outbreak in this nation.""

Here's a look at the impact on major sports:

NBA decides to suspend season

The National Basketball Association announced Wednesday night it would suspend its season after a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus.

The first player, identified by ESPN and other outlets as all-star center Rudy Gobert, was later joined by a second Jazz player who tested positive, the team said Thursday.

Initially, the NBA postponed the Jazz's game against Oklahoma Thunder before it announced it would suspend the rest of the season after Wednesday night's games.

""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,"" the NBA said in a statement.

NCAA pulls plug on March Madness

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) on Thursday canceled March Madness -- the men's Division I basketball tournament and the biggest annual event in college basketball -- as well as other winter and spring NCAA championships.

""This decision is based on the evolving Covid-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities,"" NCAA said in a statement.

The NCAA previously said March Madness would proceed without any fans , and that only essential staff members and family members would be allowed to attend.

""I know it is a great disappointment to our student-athletes and coaches, whose hard work and dedication to their sports and Duke is inspirational to so many,"" said President Vincent E. Price, ""but we must first look out for their health and well-being. This is clearly an unprecedented moment for our university, our region and the wider world.""

Multiple college conferences also canceled ongoing basketball tournaments, including the Big Ten Conference and the SEC, among others.

MLB calls off spring training, delays season

Major League Baseball will cancel its remaining spring training schedule and delay Opening Day -- scheduled for March 26 -- back by at least two weeks, the league said Thursday.

""Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of our players, employees and fans,"" the league said in a statement. ""MLB will continue to undertake the precautions and best practices recommended by public health experts. We send our best wishes to all individuals and communities that have been impacted by coronavirus.""

MLB plans to announce the postponement's impacts on the schedule at a later point, ""with the hope of resuming normal operations as soon as possible,"" the statement said.

MLS sidelines games for a month

""Our clubs were united today in the decision to temporarily suspend our season -- based on the advice and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Agency of Canada, and other public health authorities, and in the best interest of our fans, players, officials and employees,"" MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement. ""We'd like to thank our fans for their continued support during this challenging time.""

The news came after the Seattle Sounders postponed its home match on Saturday at CenturyLink Field against FC Dallas.

US Soccer calls off games through April

""With the health of our players, coaches, staff and fans as our main priority, US Soccer has decided it was in the best interest to cancel the majority of our upcoming domestic and international camps at all levels, including our senior Men's and Women's National Team games in March and April, due to the outbreak of COVID-19,"" US Soccer Chief Medical Officer George Chiampas said in a statement Thursday.

The USMNT was set to play the Netherlands in two matches later this month, while the USWNT was scheduled to host Australia on April 10 in Sandy, Utah, and Brazil on April 14 in San Jose, California.

NHL suspends season

The National Hockey League said it would suspend its season, effective immediately.

The league had been preparing for the developments without ""taking premature or unnecessary measures,"" Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

""However, following last night's news that an NBA player has tested positive for coronavirus -- and given that our leagues share so many facilities and locker rooms and it now seems likely that some member of the NHL community would test positive at some point -- it is no longer appropriate to try to continue to play games at this time,"" Bettman said.

PGA Tour cancels events as the Masters postpones

The PGA Tour announced late Thursday the Players Championship was canceled.

The tour was also canceling all other events in the coming weeks through the Valero Texas Open (March 30 to April 5), it said in a statement.

""We have pledged from the start to be responsible, thoughtful and transparent with our decision process,"" the Tour said. ""We did everything possible to create a safe environment for our players in order to continue the event throughout the weekend, and we were endeavoring to give our fans a much-needed respite from the current climate.""

But the situation is rapidly changing, organizers wrote, and ""the right thing to do for our players and our fans is to pause.""

""Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision,"" said Chairman Fred Ridley . ""We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date.""

NASCAR restricting attendance

NASCAR will hold races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Homestead-Miami Speedway without fans in attendance, it said in a statement.

""These events will be restricted to competitors, crews, officials and other necessary personnel to conduct the race,"" the statement said. ""We will work with public health officials as we determine future scheduling beyond these events.""

The Boston Marathon gets postponed

The Boston Marathon has been postponed until September 14, Mayor Marty Walsh said Friday. It was scheduled to take place on April 20.

""Our expectation and the hope right now is that this date will get us to a safer place in relation to the spread of the coronavirus,"" Walsh said.

The Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race, said in a statement it understood the decision to postpone.

""On matters of public health and safety we take our guidance from the officials entrusted with protecting the public in this area,"" CEO Tom Grilk said.

10 commandments for better sleep on World Sleep Day,"(CNN) Air, water, food -- and some would argue sex -- are key ingredients to human survival. In reality, there should be another ""s"" word in that list: sleep.

We're supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night, depending on our age, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that a third of Americans sleep fewer than seven hours a night. It's a global problem too.

""Sleep problems constitute a global epidemic that threatens health and quality of life for up to 45% of the world's population,"" according to the World Sleep Society, a non-profit organization of sleep professionals dedicated to advancing ""sleep health worldwide.""

It's the sponsor of World Sleep Day, which in 2020 is on Friday, March 13.

Yet how does anyone get to sleep today in the turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic? Workplaces and schools are shutting down, meaning hourly workers are without paychecks if they can't work and children used to free lunch are not getting fed -- never mind our concerns about elections, global stock market meltdowns or escalating border or trade wars.

It's a lot, folks, but failing to sleep isn't going to make things better.

Poor sleep contributes to weight gain, a lack of sex drive, a dysfunctional immune system, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, depression, anxiety and other disorders.

Yet despite this nuclear fallout for our health, we still don't prioritize sleep -- even when the stock market isn't crashing.

To combat that, sleep experts from the World Sleep Society have created these ten commandments of sleep hygiene for weary adults.

Establish a regular bedtime and waking time

Messing with our circadian rhythm, the internal sleep clock that tells us when it's time to sleep and rise, has been linked to hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and, most recently, the risk of having a heart attack or heart disease.

Changing your regular sleep-wake time by 90 minutes in either direction, which many of us do on the weekends, doubled the risk of cardiovascular disease over a five-year period. The more days you sleep irregularly, the higher the risk, a study found.

""People are living busy, stressful lives and not getting a lot of sleep during the week,"" Dr. David Goff, who directs the division of cardiovascular sciences at the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, told CNN in a recent interview.

""Then they are trying to get catchup sleep on the weekend, and that's not a healthy pattern,"" Goff said.

Watch your napping

While an occasional short snooze can be healthy, the World Sleep Society's second commandment warns: ""If you are in the habit of taking siestas, do not exceed 45 minutes of daytime sleep.""

One reason is because we typically enter a ""deep sleep"" cycle about 30 to 40 minutes into a nap. Waking up from deep sleep produces that ""Where am I?"" grogginess that is worse than no nap at all. A long nap can also interfere with your body clock, making it more difficult to fall asleep later that night.

Generally, catnaps that are approximately 15 to 20 minutes are fine, experts say, and may reduce fatigue; boost creativity; increase alertness; jumpstart cognitive performance; and improve mood. But try to do them earlier in the day -- before 3 p.m. -- to avoid affecting that night's full sleep cycle.

No alcohol or cigarettes

The third commandment is to ""avoid excessive alcohol ingestion four hours before bedtime, and do not smoke.""

It's truly a myth that a drink will help you sleep better at night. Instead, it traps you in the lighter stages of sleep and ""dramatically reduces the quality of your rest at night,"" said Rebecca Robbins, a fellow at Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, in a prior CNN interview.

""It continues to pull you out of rapid eye movement and the deeper stages of sleep, causing you to wake up not feeling restored,"" Robbins said.

Avoid caffeine six hours before bedtime

Here's a no-brainer: Boycott caffeine at least six hours before your normal bedtime (some experts say nothing after 3 p.m.). And caffeine is in more than just coffee, so the World Sleep Society also warns about tea and many sodas, as well as chocolate.

Yes, chocolate. That cup of hot chocolate you think may help you sleep could contain 25 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of green or black tea will provide 50 milligrams of caffeine.

Avoid eating certain foods

The fifth commandment: ""Avoid heavy, spicy, or sugary foods four hours before bedtime.""

Heavy and spicy foods may give you heartburn or other digestive issues, thus affecting your ability to get and stay asleep. As for sugar, studies show it's linked to restless, disturbed sleep and may possibly affect hormones that control cravings.

A light snack before bed ""is acceptable,"" according to the commandment. The National Sleep Foundation recommends munching on a handful of nuts; a few cherries (which are high in melatonin); a banana (which contains muscle relaxers potassium and magnesium) and decaffeinated teas such as chamomile, ginger and peppermint.

Exercise regularly, but not right before bed

Surveys of vigorous exercisers by the National Sleep Foundation show they are almost twice as likely to report high-quality, regular sleep compared to non-exercisers, and sitting for long periods of time is thought to be connected to poor sleep.

While studies haven't proven that exercise just before bed will harm sleep, many experts -- like the World Sleep Society -- recommend avoiding it. Why? Because moderate exercise heats up your core temperature, signaling the body that it's time to be awake, while the release of endorphins is thought to keep some of us alert.

Of course if you're a night owl, that may not apply to you -- so listen to your body clock. For any of us, however, doing some yoga, Tai chi or light stretching before bed could help with relaxation.

Improve your sleep environment

Having just the right sleep environment is so important that the remaining four commandments focus on how to do that.

First, keep your bedroom well-ventilated and pick a comfortable sleep temperature setting. Science is pretty much sure that a cool temperature is best, so aim for between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius).

Make sure you have ""comfortable, inviting bedding"" that fits your personal preferences (and hopefully that of any significant bed partner). ""Block out all distracting noise"" -- I sleep with a fan every night -- and get rid of any light, even the blue light from your charging smartphone.

While you're at it, go ahead and turn off any work alerts (Slack or email ping at 2 a.m., anyone?). Better still, just charge the thing outside your bedroom.

And last, but not least, ""reserve your bed for sleep and sex."" As normal as it seems to work from home in bed or play games with the kids in bed, that doesn't teach your brain to view the bedroom as a place for slumber.

And there you have it. Hopefully these 10 commandments can help you part the seas to successful slumber.

The tragic details of the killing of Amie Harwick,"Peggy Drexler is a research psychologist and the author of ""Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family"" and ""Raising Boys Without Men."" She is at work on a book about how women are conditioned to compete with one another. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) On Thursday friends and family laid to rest the well-known Los Angeles sex therapist and author Amie Harwick, who was found dead earlier this month in her Hollywood Hills home. Police had responded to neighbor reports of a ""woman screaming."" A former boyfriend, Gareth Pursehouse, was charged with one count of murder in her death and one count of first-degree residential burglary. Harwick was 38.

The tragic details have been slowly coming outÃ¢ÂÂHarwick appears to have been strangled before she was thrown from a third-floor balcony at her Hollywood Hills apartment, the latter injury killing her, according to the LA medical examiner.

But one important fact emerged early on: Harwick had twice sought restraining orders against Pursehouse, in 2011 and 2012, copies of which CNN has obtained. The 2012 order barred him from contact with her and, though a judge granted an extension, expired in 2015. Police said that Harwick saw Pursehouse at an event last month, after which she ""expressed fear of him.""

We can't know what precisely happened in this case, or how Pursehouse may respond to the charges against himÃ¢ÂÂhis arraignment is scheduled for next week. It remains unclear whether he has legal representation. What we do know is that the claims in the restraining orders Harwick filed against her former boyfriend bear all the hallmarks of an abusive relationship.

In the 2011 request for a restraining order, Harwick alleges physical abuse at the hands of Pursehouse that include choking, suffocation, pushing, kicking and punching. She also describes an incident in which she was pushed out of a car by Pursehouse on a freeway off-ramp.

The 2012 request claims Pursehouse broke into Harwick's apartment complex multiple times, once smashing picture frames, another time taping dozens of flowers to her door. She also details threatening text messages and emails.

If the charges against Pursehouse are proven, they may point up a chilling reality: A restraining order can only do so much.

In any instance of a threatening ex-partner, one might assume, or hope, that being the object of such legal intervention would bring that person up short--that exposure of his (or her) inappropriate behavior to the legal system would enforce a cooling down period, maybe create space for acceptance that a relationship has ended.

But this is too often not what happens. It's but one of many shortcomings that advocates for victims of domestic abuse describe when talking about the effective protections available to those in such relationships.

To be sure, domestic abuse has long been a huge problem in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as many as one in four women and one in nine men are victims of domestic abuse, though the numbers may even be higher.

JUST WATCHED Witherspoon reveals past abusive relationship Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Witherspoon reveals past abusive relationship 01:04

Abuse is chronically underreported, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, or RAINN, which operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline : Only about a quarter of all physical assaults and one half of stalkings are reported to the police. That's often because cases can be difficult to prosecute.

Often a ""he said, she said"" mentality prevails, and most cases require the testimony of the victim, which many are unwilling to provideÃ¢ÂÂbecause they're scared, because they're worried of what their abuser might do if they don't win, or simply because the nature of abusive relationships means victims often blame themselves: If I didn't act this way, say this thing, forget to do that, he wouldn't behave as he does. I can make it stop.

Except she can't. And neither, in many cases, can the legal system. Perpetrators of sexual violence are less likely to go to jail than other criminals. According to RAINN, of 230 incidents of assault reported to police, just five cases will lead to a felony conviction.

While restraining orders can be effective, they are often difficult to uphold. According to a report in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law that surveyed a broad array of research studies and legal, sociological and mental health literature, reported rates of restraining-order violation across the country vary from as low as 7.1% to as high as 81.3%.

2008 study of restraining orders among victims of intimate partner homicide, meanwhile, found that about 11% of women killed by male intimate partners had been issued a restraining order; one-fifth of those victims were killed within two days of the order being issued, and about one-third were killed within a month.

Traditional restraining ordersÃ¢ÂÂthe kind that, in general, prohibit an abuser from coming near the person who sought the orderÃ¢ÂÂmeanwhile, expire. They require victims to file them and report violations, and only work against those who fear law enforcement. And, well, in the end, they're just a piece of paper. They aren't ankle monitors, there's no GPS capability attached.

A victim can call the police if the person against whom she's been granted a restraining or no contact order shows up at her officeÃ¢ÂÂbut he's already shown up at her office. With nothing, physically, to stop him.

A 2018 piece in The Atlantic looking at the evolution of restraining orders to prohibit abusive digital communication, meanwhile, noted how difficult they are to enforceÃ¢ÂÂgiven the wide-reaching nature of social mediaÃ¢ÂÂand, therefore, how often they fail.

Again, the details of Harwick's murder are still emerging, and we don't know if her ex-boyfriend had a hand in her death.

In the meantime, friends of Harwick have started an online petition that seeks stronger recourse and support for domestic violence victims, including making restraining orders valid for longer than five years without need for a renewal, and eliminating the need for victims to appear in court to testify against their abusers, according to the LA Times. They also seek to mandate counseling for alleged abusers.

All three measures would be huge improvements to the current systemÃ¢ÂÂso much so that it's a wonder they aren't already in place. ""We want to push for laws to be changed in her honor so this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" Harwick's friend Diana Arias said.

Health agencies, law enforcement and lawmakers need to get involved hereÃ¢ÂÂthere's simply no downside and plenty of up. The rest of us need to get angry and push them until they do.",human
The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"Bus Ridership Among the 15 Largest Transit Agencies Note: Each line represents the largest transit agency in the metro region. Some regions may have multiple agencies. Source: National Transit Database

Sometime around 2013, bus ridership across much of the country began to decline. It dropped in Washington, in Chicago, in Los Angeles, in Miami. It dropped in large cities and smaller ones. It dropped in places that cut service, and in some that invested in it. It dropped in Sun Belt cities where transit has always struggled to compete with the car, and it dropped in older Eastern cities with a long history of transit use.

By late 2019, through nearly seven straight years of decline, national bus ridership in America was at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, a trend that has left service already weakened as transit agencies brace for a public health crisis.

The bus started to lose ground many decades ago as Americans bought cars, suburbanized and spread out. But the timing of this recent free fall has been more perplexing. The economy was strong in this period, meaning more people had jobs to commute to. And many of these metro areas have been growing in population Ã¢ÂÂ that means more commuters, too.

What has been happening then, across all of these places, at the same time?

The answer probably lies deep in a number of trends: the rise of on-demand technology, the changing nature of work, the evolution of e-commerce, the redevelopment of city centers, the influx of young professionals, and the suburbanization of the poor. Many seismic shifts in urban life are reflected in this one datapoint Ã¢ÂÂ the broad decline of bus ridership.

Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of societal change thatÃ¢ÂÂs not necessarily connected,Ã¢ÂÂ said Eric Lind, the research and analytics manager with Metro Transit, which serves Minneapolis and St. Paul. Ã¢ÂÂBut it all points in the same way to fewer rides.Ã¢ÂÂ

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs worrisome both for the remaining riders and for cities that will need strong mass transit to meet their climate goals.

In Minneapolis, bus ridership began declining in 2014 and has fallen by 26 percent. Some bus trips appear to have shifted to a newly opened light rail line. But Uber and Lyft have expanded in the city over this same time. Bike commuting has increased. The transit agency has also detected an uptick in car ownership in neighborhoods historically well served by buses. And in a strong economy, Metro Transit struggled to replace a generation of retiring bus operators, hampering service. Workers have simply had more options, as agencies around the country have found.

Mr. Lind suspects another demographic shift at play: Older people are traditionally a reliable pool of bus riders. But baby boomers aging into retirement now are the first generation to have spent their entire lives in a world dominated by cars. Unlike their parents, Mr. Lind suggested, baby boomers were never transit riders. They donÃ¢ÂÂt remember riding the streetcar. They donÃ¢ÂÂt have muscle memory of what itÃ¢ÂÂs like to take the bus.

Researchers at Georgia Tech who have been studying the decline of bus ridership have found another demographic clue. Kari Watkins, a professor of civil engineering, and Simon Berrebi, a post-doctoral fellow, compared bus-stop data going back to 2012 in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Miami and Portland, Ore., four notably different areas where transit agencies automatically count passengers as they board the bus.

Falling ridership in Atlanta, Miami, Minneapolis and Portland, Ore.

In Miami and Atlanta, neighborhoods with more college-educated residents had steeper declines in bus ridership. And one demographic pattern appeared across all four cities: Whiter neighborhoods have been losing the most ridership.

Ã¢ÂÂThat made us think, Ã¢ÂÂWhat are the changes in the behaviors of people who are white?Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Mr. Berrebi said.

He and Ms. Watkins believe they may be taking greater advantage of new alternatives to the bus, like Uber and Lyft or bike-sharing. Other research shows that bike-sharing has eaten into bus ridership (while surveys in some cities report that bike-sharing riders skew highly educated and white).

Studies have been less conclusive on the effect of ride-hailing companies, in part because their user data hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been accessible to researchers. But preliminary findings from a continuing project through the Transportation Research Board show that the largest declines in transit ridership at the metro level can be attributed to the introduction of ride-hailing services. And in the largest cities, ride-hailing has affected buses more than rail.

Mr. Berrebi and Ms. Watkins also suggest that white and more educated residents may have more access to flexible or remote work in an environment where the nature of work is shifting for everyone.

Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt go to work in the same way that we traditionally have,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Watkins said. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre doing it at more odd hours. More people are teleworking now. All of this is morphing in ways such that Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm going to buy a monthly transit passÃ¢ÂÂ is kind of disappearing.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Georgia Tech research raises a provocative question: If whiter neighborhoods are losing the most bus trips, what will happen in neighborhoods that grow whiter over time? Gentrification typically doesnÃ¢ÂÂt move fast enough to be detected in the data that Ms. Watkins and Mr. Berrebi studied (although they did see some evidence of ridership declines, particularly in Miami neighborhoods that have grown whiter).

But in some cities it is hard to imagine that shifting demographics wonÃ¢ÂÂt affect bus use, particularly as higher-income residents Ã¢ÂÂ the very riders who have the most options Ã¢ÂÂ move into dense neighborhoods well covered by transit, and as poorer residents who rely on transit the most move farther out.

In Atlanta, demographic patterns are changing faster than the ability of public transit to keep up, said Jacob Tzegaegbe, the lead transportation adviser in the mayorÃ¢ÂÂs office.

Ã¢ÂÂOne of my personal fears is the suburbanization of poverty,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to serve places that donÃ¢ÂÂt have density. And it's really hard to do it in a way thatÃ¢ÂÂs cost-effective.Ã¢ÂÂ

A bus in Lawrence, Mass. Ridership has declined by 38 percent there since 2010. Greta Rybus for The New York Times

For several decades, Atlanta neglected its bus system as it invested in rail instead, said Jeffrey Parker, the C.E.O. of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. Then competition suddenly appeared from ride-hailing, electric bikes and scooters. The redevelopment of close-in neighborhoods also means more people can walk to work. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a good thing. But it can further erode bus ridership.

Add in the growth of e-commerce, and now streets are further congested with delivery trucks, slowing buses even more. And quick trips to the store that bus riders once took are no longer being made.

Ã¢ÂÂIt feels like the world is changing faster than it was five years ago, even faster than it was a couple of years ago,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Parker said.

And much of this is outside of his agencyÃ¢ÂÂs control: the development patterns, the demographic change, the rise of Amazon and Uber.

Ã¢ÂÂWhat do they control? They control providing service every day, and operating that service,Ã¢ÂÂ said Paul P. Skoutelas, the C.E.O. of the American Public Transportation Association. Ã¢ÂÂThey donÃ¢ÂÂt control the streets. They donÃ¢ÂÂt make the regulations and the rules about who gets what street space and where people are dropped off and picked up.Ã¢ÂÂ

Agencies donÃ¢ÂÂt control all the infrastructure and subsidies that help transitÃ¢ÂÂs biggest competitor, the car. Past research has suggested that transit riders are even more sensitive to changes in gas prices than they are to changes in transit fares. Recently gas has been cheap, and interest rates on auto loans low. In many cities, the price of urban real estate has risen, but not the price of street parking.

Michael Manville, a professor of urban planning at U.C.L.A., suspects that the rise of Craigslist has fundamentally altered the market for used cars, too, making them easier to find and cheaper to buy. That may be one reason why car access has risen.

In California, it's also possible that transit ridership has been affected at the margins by a state law granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. As immigration falls in general, Mr. Manville said, that could shrink another reliable pool of bus riders.

Even riders who once seemed to have few options to the bus increasingly do.

Ã¢ÂÂIf you build it in a way where only those without a choice would ride it Ã¢ÂÂ and as soon as they have any choice they jump Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs not really a transportation system youÃ¢ÂÂre building,Ã¢ÂÂ said Beth Osborne, the director of the advocacy group Transportation for America.

The answer, Mr. Manville said, would be to make the true costs of driving more apparent Ã¢ÂÂ picture congestion pricing, higher parking rates, higher gas taxes Ã¢ÂÂ while giving some of the carÃ¢ÂÂs structural advantages to buses instead.

Ã¢ÂÂAt the end of the day, we may never know what is driving this decline,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Manville said. Ã¢ÂÂBut I guarantee you that if you took a lane of Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles and gave it only to the bus, ridership would go up.Ã¢ÂÂ

In Washington, where nearly all of these forces are apparent, the City Council is considering giving residents $100 a month to use on transit. The proposal, from a city councilman, Charles Allen, would be paired with a fund dedicated to improving bus service, particularly in poorer neighborhoods. The transit subsidy, however, wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be means-tested, available only to poorer residents. It would go to everyone, ignoring the distinction between riders who have many other options and those who have few.

Ã¢ÂÂIf you believe public transit is a public good, like I do, then you donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test it,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Allen said. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test your road. I donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test building your sidewalk. I donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test building your bike lane.Ã¢ÂÂ

HeÃ¢ÂÂs also trying to build a broader constituency for bus service, because that is probably what it would take to accomplish things like taking lanes of traffic from cars and dedicating them to buses instead. The few cities that have bucked the declining ridership trends, like Seattle, have managed to do that. In the cities that havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet, bus riders are at risk of becoming a smaller and smaller group, moving even slower.",human
David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact,"Story highlights Contrary to what Sean Spicer said, Axelrod says he and Robert Gibbs did not regularly attend the most sensitive National Security Council meetings

"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","A public hospital nurse, for example, would likely not be able to stay home from work even if her child was home from school. And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

Ã¢ÂÂThe downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the CouncilÃ¢ÂÂs health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving Ã¢ÂÂreports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,Ã¢ÂÂ said ScarsdaleÃ¢ÂÂs school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday. Ã¢ÂÂPreventative measures are only effective if we embrace and implement them as a community.Ã¢ÂÂ

Most public schools across the state remain open, with some major exceptions, including public schools in Scarsdale, East Ramapo, and New Rochelle in Westchester County, which is the epicenter of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs outbreak. Initially, only three New Rochelle public schools located in a one-mile Ã¢ÂÂcontainmentÃ¢ÂÂ zone closed earlier this week, but the entire district shut down on Friday following protests from families.

Inside New York CityÃ¢ÂÂs schools this week, educators were concerned and conflicted.

Ã¢ÂÂThankfully, itÃ¢ÂÂs not my decision,Ã¢ÂÂ said Liat Olenick, a teacher at the Brooklyn Arbor School in Williamsburg, of closure. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a really hard one.Ã¢ÂÂ",human

Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.

Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.

The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.

Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.

Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.

""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""

Keeping cabins calm

Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.

Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.

Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.

Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.

""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES.""

Flight attendants' opposition is significant.

They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.

On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.

Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.

""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.

""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""

Passengers advocating for quiet

Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.

Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.

Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.

""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""

Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.

Business travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.

Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.

""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""

One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.

This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.

Is the technology safe?

Newer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers' technology. Shutterstock

The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.

In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.

Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.

The rise of smartphones changed everything.

As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.

Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.

Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.

Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.

""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.""

""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""

Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.

Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.

""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""

Regulatory, practical obstacles

Texting is already permitted on some airlines. Shutterstock

Though it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.

First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.

The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.

""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.

Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.""

The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.

Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.

Who calls people anyway?

What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.

Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.

""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""

Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.

"On Friday the 13th we wonder why, scientifically, we believe in superstitions","(CNN) The number 13, black cats, breaking mirrors, or walking under ladders, may all be things you actively avoid -- if you're anything like the 25% of people in the US who consider themselves superstitious.

Even if you don't consider yourself a particularly superstitious person, you probably say ""bless you"" when someone sneezes, just in case the devil should decide to steal their soul -- as our ancestors thought possible during a sneeze

Superstition also explains why many buildings do not have a 13th floor -- preferring to label it 14, 14A 12B or M (the 13th letter of the alphabet) on elevator button panels because of concerns about superstitious tenants. Indeed, 13% of people in one survey indicated that staying on the 13th floor of a hotel would bother them -- and 9% said they would ask for a different room

On top of this, some airlines such as Air France and Lufthansa, do not have a 13th row . Lufthansa also has no 17th row -- because in some countries -- such as Italy and Brazil -- the typical unlucky number is 17 and not 13.

What is superstition?

Although there is no single definition of superstition , it generally means a belief in supernatural forces -- such as fate -- the desire to influence unpredictable factors and a need to resolve uncertainty. In this way then, individual beliefs and experiences drive superstitions, which explains why they are generally irrational and often defy current scientific wisdom.

Psychologists who have investigated what role superstitions play, have found that they derive from the assumption that a connection exists between co-occurring, non-related events. For instance, the notion that charms promote good luck, or protect you from bad luck.

For many people, engaging with superstitious behaviors provides a sense of control and reduces anxiety -- which is why levels of superstition increase at times of stress and angst. This is particularly the case during times of economic crisis and social uncertainty -- notably wars and conflicts. Indeed, researchers have observed how in Germany between 1918 and 1940 measures of economic threat correlated directly with measures of superstition.

Touch wood

Superstitious beliefs have been shown to help promote a positive mental attitude. Although they can lead to irrational decisions, such as trusting in the merits of good luck and destiny rather than sound decision making.

Carrying charms, wearing certain clothes, visiting places associated with good fortune, preferring specific colors and using particular numbers are all elements of superstition. And although these behaviors and actions can appear trivial, for some people, they can often affect choices made in the real world.

Superstitions can also give rise to the notion that objects and places are cursed. Such as the Annabelle the Doll -- who featured in The Conjuring and two other movies -- and is said to be inhabited by the spirit of a dead girl. A more traditional illustration is the Curse of the Pharaohs, which is said to be cast upon any person who disturbs the mummy of an Ancient Egyptian person -- especially a pharaoh.

Numbers themselves can also often be associated with curses. For example, the figure 666 is a number some believe to be associated with the devil, and is often featured in stories of misfortune or curses

Sporting superstitions

Superstition is also highly prevalent within sport -- especially in highly competitive situations. Four out of five professional athletes report engaging with at least one superstitious behavior prior to performance . Within sport, superstitions have been shown to reduce tension and provide a sense of control over unpredictable, chance factors.

Superstition practices tend to vary across sports, but there are similarities. Within football, gymnastics and athletics, for example, competitors reported praying for success, checking appearance in mirror and dressing well to feel better prepared. Players and athletes also engage with personalized actions and behaviors -- such as wearing lucky clothes, kit and charms.

Famous sportspeople often display superstitious behaviours. Notably, basketball legend Michael Jordan concealed his lucky North Carolina shorts under his Chicago Bulls team kit. Similarly, the tennis legend BjÃÂ¶rn Bork, reportedly wore the same brand of shirt when preparing for Wimbledon.

Rafael Nadal has an array of rituals that he performs each time he plays. These include the manner in which he places his water bottles and taking freezing cold showers. Nadal believes these rituals help him to find focus, flow and perform well.

Walking under ladders

What all this shows is that superstitions can provide reassurance and can help to reduce anxiety in some people. But while this may well be true, research has shown that actions associated with superstitions can also become self-reinforcing -- in that the behavior develops into a habit and failure to perform the ritual can actually result in anxiety

This is even though the actual outcome of an event or situation is still dependent on known factors -- rather than unknown supernatural forces. A notion consistent with the often quoted maxim , ""the harder you work (practice) the luckier you get.""",human
Zuckerberg's important message on miscarriage,"Story highlights Mark Zuckerberg announced that his wife had three miscarriages while trying to get pregnant

Jodi Abbott, Eugene Declercq: We need to talk about pregnancy loss more; there is no shame in having a miscarriage

Jodi F. Abbott is vice chair for education at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Boston University School of Medicine. Eugene Declercq, founder of Birth by the Numbers, is professor and assistant dean at Community Health Sciences Department, Boston University School of Public Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.

(CNN) Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are going to have a baby girl.

In his public post that went viral, Zuckerberg wrote: ""We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way. You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience.""

Zuckerberg's frank admission of his wife's three miscarriages led to a vast outpouring of stories from women and families who have faced a similar situation.

Millennials have become accustomed to posting their lives online, and yet, as they are coupling and starting families they are discovering that few experiences are as isolating as losing a desired pregnancy.

On top of that, there is a certain stigma associated with miscarriages, as though it's the fault of the parents. But it isn't, and the stigma will be removed only if we talk about it more -- openly and honestly. There is no shame in having a miscarriage.

Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much in 'Big Time Adolescence',"(CNN) Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much as a performer playing a 20-something slacker in ""Big Time Adolescence,"" a Hulu-bound movie that's most surprising for what it isn't. Somewhat ironically, the main flaw with this earnest film built around a directionless character is its lack of a clear objective.

Buying into the premise requires a bit of leeway to get started: During high school, Davidson's Zeke dated the older sister of Mo (Griffin Gluck), and remained his pal after they broke up. Now Mo's a 16-year-old high school student -- with all the attendant insecurities -- and Zeke, at 23, mostly enjoys getting high and playing video games.

That the two remain near-inseparable seems odd to, well, pretty much everyone, perhaps especially Mo's dad (Jon Cryer). Yet the family tolerates the situation, which will gradually have pretty significant consequences (foreshadowed in a pre-credit sequence) as Mo's budding adolescence runs into Zeke's Peter Pan-like case of arrested development.

For Davidson, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star whose off-screen life is generally more interesting than his on-screen contributions, Zeke certainly offers an easy transition to movies, though the central focus is actually Gluck, whose struggles with all the usual teen troubles are complicated by Zeke's been-there advice and generally bad influence.

Mo insists Zeke is ""a nice guy once you get to know him,"" but his cavalier attitude -- toward everything from his retail job to relationships -- doesn't always make him the most sterling counselor. That includes his suggestion that Mo become the source of booze and pot for a circle of ""friends"" that not surprisingly mushrooms after learning that he can supply them.

Coronavirus decisions creates big burden for college students,"Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book ""The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness."" Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN

(CNN) For students at colleges and universities across the United States, coronavirus is bringing a new layer of uncertainty as classes are moved online and some students are being told to move out. Harvard University and Amherst College are among the latest institutions to ask their students to move out or not return after spring break.

Jill Filipovic

It's an understandable decision, given that schools with high numbers of students living in shared quarters on campus -- attending group lectures and labs, and eating together in the dining halls -- are perfect petri dishes for disease.

But many of these same schools have also been trying to recreate themselves as instruments for equality, expanding need-based financial aid and offering need-blind admissions so that anyone who qualifies, regardless of family wealth, can enjoy the huge step up that schools like Harvard confer.

But it's these same students who may get caught in the coronavirus response crosshairs.

As it stands, many schools do not yet offer a clear public plan for how to handle students who can't go home: those whose homes are in affected countries, those who are low-income and rely on financial aid for their housing, those whose homes don't offer space conducive to learning (not every home in America, let alone the world, has the fast WiFi connection necessary for online classes), those who may not have a bed or place to stay in their childhood homes, and those who support themselves and don't have homes to go back to.",human
The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ At the forefront of the photo, a diver leaps into azure Spanish skies, arching her body into a streamlined curve.

In the background, a panoramic Barcelona skyline stretches out, punctuated by La Sagrada Familia, Gaudi's half-finished masterpiece of a cathedral, and fringed by distant hills.

This incredible shot was first captured by British photographer Bob Martin in the lead up to the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, and matched later by photographer Simon Bruty, for Getty Images, in the lead gallery picture above.

Over the course of the Olympics' two-week stint in Barcelona, variations on this eye-catching scene were broadcast on television screens around the world, cementing a spectacular image of the Spanish city in the memories of millions.

The result? Barcelona arrived squarely on the tourism map, transforming from an undiscovered gem to a must-visit European destination: in 1990, there were just 1.7 million overnight visitors, by 2016, there were over 8 million.

Sure, during that time the Spanish city also benefited from the growth of budget flights, a booming cruise industry and increasing word of mouth reports of its many cultural highlights -- but many reckon the successful Olympic stint is what kickstarted the uptake.

But while tourists still flock to Barcelona's MontjuÃÂ¯c area to see the view that the Olympics made famous, across the Mediterranean in Greece, many of the venues that were once the glory of Athens 2004 lie seemingly semi-abandoned and forgotten.

They're not alone: In China, some of Beijing's 2008 Olympic venues have been absorbed by nature, weeds growing inside what was once the BMX track.

With a new Olympic city in the spotlight every couple of years, the short-term tourism opportunity and long-term tourism legacy promised by hosting the Games is alluring.

But the threat of populating your city with ""white elephant"" venues that serve no purpose post-Games is increasingly disconcerting. Early this year, concerns were raised about the safety of Rio's 2016 Olympics Park, with a judge even ordering its closure

So why do Olympic venues sometimes get abandoned? And how do cities ensure a positive Olympic legacy for both tourists and locals?

Building an Olympic city

The Summer Olympics are one of the world's biggest sporting events, and, unsurprisingly, building an Olympic city is no easy feat.

It all starts with a would-be host submitting a bid, outlining how they intend to get their Games off the ground, and how they'll transform their city into a sporting playground.

""These days you need somewhere between 35 and 40 athletic venues to just host the required games for the Olympics,"" explains Andrew Zimbalist, Robert A. Woods professor of economics at Smith College in Massachusetts, and the author of several studies on the economics of the Olympic Games.

""On top of that, you need an Olympic village that will house somewhere in the neighborhood of 18,000 people, you need a media village that also requires beds for several thousand people.""

In short, it takes a lot of space and a lot of venues.

In that sense, says Zimbalist, a city getting saddled with white elephants post-Olympics is perhaps more likely than not.

""Ask yourself the question, if a city did not have a economically justifiable reason to have a facility the day before the Olympics began, why would they have an economically justifiable reason to have the facility 18 days later, after the Olympics ends, or after the Paralympics, a month and a half later, ends?"" the economist tells CNN Travel.

In recent years, bidding cities have tried to circumnavigate this issue by planning ahead, devising ways to successfully transform into an Olympic city, and successfully transform back again, whether via temporary venues, or converting pre-existing apparatus.

This isn't just cities being inventive -- nowadays it's pretty much mandated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), who oversee the Games and the bidding process.

In 2013, the IOC adopted its Olympic Agenda 2020 reform program, seeking to make the games more sustainable and to ""keep up with the changes in our current world."" The new program stipulates that the venues do not need to be permanent, or new, and costs do not need to be astronomical.

""Image building is extremely powerful,"" says Christophe Dubi, executive director of the IOC. ""But you need a plan. That's what we gauge now, in the dialogue [with host cities.]""

Making the bid

Why a destination bids to host an Olympics Games is dependent upon its individual economic, social, cultural and historical factors.

""Cities bid for the Olympics for geopolitics reasons, for media branding reasons, for sponsorship, to track foreign direct investment and talent and so on,"" says Tony Johnston, head of Tourism at Althone Institute of Technology in Ireland.

While tourism might not be the motivating factor for bidding, hosting a mega event puts your city on show, on a global scale. And such high stakes have, for a long while, come hand-in-hand with high prices.

Take the Canadian city of Montreal, which hosted the Summer Olympics in 1976, and reportedly only stopped paying off its Olympic debt three decades later . Or Sochi, in Russia, which took on the 2014 Winter Olympics amid plans to spend upwards of an eye-watering $50 billion.

Andrew Zimbalist, Robert A. Woods professor of economics at Smith College Ã¢ÂÂIf a city did not have a economically justifiable reason to have a facility the day before the Olympics began, why would they have an economically justifiable reason to have the facility 18 days later, after the Olympics ends?Ã¢ÂÂ

Some city populations have expressed concerns about the mounting costs. Boston, in the US, and Hamburg, in Germany, withdrew their respective bids for the 2024 games. Boston made the decision after polls indicated a lack of support, while Hamburg pulled out of its bid following a citywide referendum in which 51.6% of residents said they were against the idea.

""We are encouraging the organizing committees to find solutions that are cheaper if they do exist,"" Dubi tells CNN Travel. ""And we really embrace that spirit of creativity, innovation in order to contain the costs.""

Dubi says he's confident prices are becoming more restrained.

He also adds that the importance of planning for legacy is true of any major sporting event.

""We are permanently dialoguing with future hosts for 2030, 32, 34 etc,"" adds Dubi. ""What is your long term plan in terms of development for the city and the region? And how can the Games contribute? You have to have a strong plan and the Games as a contributor to make it a success.""

London as a case study

In 2012, right before the Olympic Agenda 2020 was adopted, London hosted the Summer Olympic Games. This Olympic stint didn't offer Barcelona levels of tourism transformation -- perhaps because, as economics and environmental studies expert Victor A. Matheson jokingly put it: ""The Olympics aren't going to put London on the map because if London isn't already on your map, you really need to get yourself a new map.""

But London's Games did try and prepare for a post-Olympics future. How successfully the city did so depends on who you ask.

The London Legacy Development Corporation was formed a couple months before the 2012 Olympics, with the aim of using ""the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of the London 2012 Games and the creation of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to develop a dynamic new heart for east London, creating opportunities for local people and driving innovation and growth in London and the UK.""

Peter Tudor, the corporation's director of visitor services, recently showed CNN Travel around the London Aquatics Centre, the swanky water palace purpose-built for the London Olympics' swimming, diving and synchronized swimming events.

It's been a public pool since 2014. On a rainy winter weekday, it was teeming with activity -- from school kids crowding the entryways to serious swimmers doing laps beneath the undulating roof.

""The London Olympics was probably one of the first times people were really thinking about what happens after the Games, lots of cities got to the end of their Games and then asked the question,"" says Tudor.

The Aquatics Centre cost ÃÂ£269 million to build, and underwent a lengthy, pricey, transformation process to become a public space.

It still hosts official events from time to time: the FINA Diving World Series is scheduled to take place here in March 2020, followed shortly after by the British Swimming Championships.

But for some east Londoners, it's just their local gym -- even if UK Olympian Tom Daley can occasionally be seen catapulting off the diving board.

London's Olympic Park is based in Stratford, in the east of the city, a historically poorer, industrial area. Part of the London Olympic bid was a promise to regenerate this part of the British capital.

The city's then-mayor, Ken Livingstone, said the Olympics was ""the only way to get the billions of pounds out of the government to develop the East End -- to clean the soil, put in the infrastructure and build the housing.""

There's certainly been a lot of housing built here, pre and post-2012. There's still more development to come as part of the still-in-the-works East Bank development , including planned east London offshoots of the Victoria and Albert Museum and Sadlers Wells Theatre.

Additionally, in the post-Olympic years, London's stadium has become a soccer hub for London football team West Ham United. The ArcelorMittal Orbit tower -- a piece of public art designed to symbolize the triumph of the Olympics -- doubles up as a slide and viewing platform.

Still, this transformation didn't come cheap. The London Stadium was originally pitched at ÃÂ£280 million ($358 million at today's exchange rates) -- its final construction cost was ÃÂ£486 million, and converting it into a venue suitable for West Ham cost an additional ÃÂ£272 million.

And naysayers question whether there was a need for a super fancy helter-skelter, or huge new stadium. Plus, they say, the East End area of the city had been pegged for regeneration whether or not the Olympics came to town.

""If the [British] government had simply provided incentives to encourage that development, then you would have would have gotten much more authentic and organic and deep economic development in that area then anything that you might have gotten from the Olympic construction,"" says economist Zimbalist.

Londoner Julian Cheyne used to live in a housing estate called Clays Lane, knocked down in 2007 to make way for the Olympic Park. Cheyne is the co-founder of a site called GamesMonitor, that views the Olympic project through a critical lens.

""If you are a part of the property industry, then you can make a lot of money out of projects associated with the Olympics,"" Cheyne tells CNN Travel. ""And it means that you get the opportunity to remove people from areas of land which you might have your eye on.""

Cheyne was rehoused and received monetary compensation, but he says he had ""no desire to move.""

He is, in fact, skeptical that the Olympics have any sort of positive impact on tourism.

""It's very difficult to think of any particular benefits that London has had as a result of the Olympics. It was a well known city. It didn't need this boost in order to get tourists to come to it.""

""I'm not really a fan of the Olympics at all, I don't think that these major events contribute anything to the cities, apart from a degree of destruction to largely poor neighborhoods,"" says Cheyne.

The London Legacy Corporation, however, argues the city's Olympics, and ongoing legacy has largely boosted the lives of locals and tourists.

Peter Tudor points to a series of recent high profile sporting events as one example: in 2019, the London Stadium played host to two Major League Baseball (MLB) games between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The matches were part of a two year arrangement for MLB to play season matches at the city's stadium -- this year will see the St. Louis Cardinals take on the Chicago Cubs.

The 2019 series added a reported nearly ÃÂ£37 million ($48.1 million) to the London economy . Fifteen percent of the fans who attended were from the United States, 10% were international tourists from elsewhere. Meanwhile, 65% of attendees traveled from other places in the UK.

The IOC, says Tudor, likes to recommend prospective bidders come and visit the London venues -- to see how legacy building is done.

""We show other nations delegations round on a fairly frequent basis,"" he explains.

Unexpected tourism

When it comes to an Olympic tourism uptake, almost three decades after divers were filmed catapulting through Barcelona's skyline, the Spanish city's still most often held up as an example of the Olympics' power to transform a city's tourism fortunes for the better.

It's not the only one, though. Turin, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006, also saw a boost: Visitor numbers in Piedmont increased from 3.3 million in 2006 to 4.3 million in 2012.

Another Winter Olympics success story is Salt Lake City, Utah, which hosted in 2002.

Utah, once second-fiddle to Colorado as a ski destination, had its profile raised thanks to the Olympics, explains economist Victor Matheson. The exposure led to an increase in the number of skier visits in Salt Lake City (and surrounding area), and more rapid growth than neighboring Colorado, Matheson says.

These success stories might have staying power in the public consciousness, but so too do the abandoned venues; stories on these spots make headlines, populate Instagram and Flickr and inspire think pieces.

While on paper abandoned Olympic infrastructure might seem like a waste, a failure to capitalize on Olympic legacy, oddly, such venues can become a tourist attraction of their own -- albeit a niche, and possibly even illegal-to-visit one.

The popularity of ""ruin porn"" -- artsy photographs of abandoned venues -- can send photographers flocking to the graffiti-strewn bobsled tracks of Sarajevo, or Athens' disused venues.

The IOC, meanwhile, is keen to stress that the venues which appear abandoned sometimes have more to them than meets the eye.

""We are conscious that some venues from past Games are not utilized as fully as they could be,"" says Bernardo Domingues, media relations manager at the IOC.

""However, too often we see outdated or out of context reports or images of venues from past Games that do not represent the current situation or account for the full picture.""

Christophe Dubi, executive director, International Olympic Committee Ã¢ÂÂThe one message that I really insist upon is that we have turned the page, Games bidding and Games organization has been really totally revampedÃ¢ÂÂ

The IOC points to Beijing's often-photographed BMX track, saying it was always intended as a temporary facility, and photos of the cities Canoeing and Rowing Park, which it says do not demonstrate the facility's full use.

In Rio, the issue, says Dubi, is that temporary venues haven't been dismantled.

Domingues says the IOC is currently conducting a research study looking at the post-Games use of all existing Olympic venues, with results due in early 2021.

Not everything's been perfect in the past, the organization admits, and it says it's learning from this -- pointing to the new Olympic Agenda 2020 reform program.

""The one message that I really insist upon is that we have turned the page. Games bidding and Games organization has been really totally revamped,"" says Dubi.

Olympic future

The mission of the modern Olympic Games is to build bridges between countries and celebrate connections -- and offer a stellar fortnight of sporting greatness.

This mission is predicated on the idea that the Olympics sets up shop in a different city every couple of years, opening the world's eyes to the wonders of that particular destination.

Still, some experts suggest that to eradicate fears of disused venues, and as a way of addressing the increasingly fervent question of sustainability, the IOC should abandon the bidding system altogether.

The proposed alternative? A few cities alternate hosting duties at purpose-built, permanent venues. Andrew Zimbalist calls this concept, ""the only sensible plan,"" while Matheson, while admitting that it's not 100% in the spirit of the Olympics, says he would ""vote in favor of that -- and in a heartbeat.""

The IOC, however, is more interested in an alternative idea that's already being put into practice: giving the Olympic Games a larger footprint -- that is, a region, or even entire country hosting, rather than one city.

The 2026 Winter Olympics, for example, is due to be hosted by Italian cities Milan and Cortina.

And while Tokyo's initial plan for 2020 was to construct new venues on the islands surrounding Tokyo Bay, this idea was rejigged to instead reuse venues from the Games in 1964, build temporary structures that will be dismantled post-Games, and utilize existing structures further afield.

There are 12 venues that are located over five miles from the Olympic village HQ.

This plan comes with an added tourism bonus, as more of the country will be spotlighted.

The best ways to get yourself hired,"(CNN) It's a good time to be a job seeker.

The job market held strong in February with employers adding 273,000 jobs. But that doesn't mean landing a new job is a piece of cake. The process can still be taxing: tailoring your resume to the job opening , preparing for multiple rounds of interviews and then (hopefully) there's the negotiation process

Here are the best ways to get hired:

Why women feel pressured to shave,"Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

Type ""When did women start..."" into Google and one of the top autocomplete suggestions to pop up is, ""When did women start shaving?""

The answer goes back centuries. Hair removal -- or otherwise -- has long shaped gender dynamics, served as a signifier of class and defined notions of femininity and the ""ideal body.""

However, in its most recent evolution, body hair is being embraced by a growing number of young women who are turning a source of societal shame and turning it into a sign of personal strength.

The rise of gender fluidity, the body-positivity movement and the beauty sector's growing inclusiveness have all contributed to the new wave of hirsuteness.

""It's been deeply stigmatized -- it still is -- and cast with shame,"" said Heather Widdows, professor of global ethics at the UK's University of Birmingham and author of ""Perfect Me: Beauty as an Ethical Ideal,"" in a phone interview. ""Its removal is one of the few aesthetic traditions that have gone from being a beauty routine to a hygienic one.

""Today, most women feel like they have to shave. Like they have no other option. There's something deeply fraught about that -- though perceptions are slowly changing.""

From ancient Egypt to Darwin

Hairlessness wasn't established as a mandate for women until the early 20th century.

Before that, removing body hair was something both men and women did -- as far back as the Stone Age, then through ancient Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire -- using seashells, beeswax and various other depilatories. In these earlier eras, as Victoria Sherrow writes in ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History,"" hairlessness was seen mostly as a way to keep the body clean. Ancient Romans also associated it with class: The smoother your skin was, the purer and more superior you were.

In the Middle East, as well as East and South Asia, threading was used on the entire face. But unibrows were actually considered alluring for both sexes, and were often accentuated with kohl.

In Persia, hair removal and brow-shaping was a marker of adulthood and marriage for women, and was mainly reserved for that occasion. While in China, body hair was long considered normal, and even today woman face far less social pressure to shave.

The same goes for other countries in Asia: While hair removal has become routine for many of the continent's young women, waxing or trimming pubic hair, for instance, isn't as common as it is in the West.

In fact, in Korea, pubic hair was long considered a sign of fertility and sexual health -- so much so that, in the mid-2010s, it was reported that some Korean women were undergoing pubic hair transplants, to add extra hair to their own.

Europeans weren't always obsessed with hair-free skin.

In the Middle Ages, good Catholic women were expected to let their hair grow as a display of femininity, while keeping it concealed in public. The face was the only place where hair was considered unsightly: 14th-century ladies would pluck the hair from their foreheads in order to push back their hairlines and give their faces a more oval appearance. When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558, she made eyebrow removal fashionable.

By the late 18th century, hair removal still wasn't considered essential by European and American women, although when the first safety razor for men was invented by French barber Jacques Perret in 1760, some women reportedly used them too.

It wasn't until the late 1800s that women on both sides of the Atlantic started making hair removal an integral part of their beauty routines. The modern-day notion of body hair being unwomanly can be traced back to Charles Darwin's 1871 book ""Descent of a Man,"" according to Rebecca Herzig's ""Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.""

Darwin's theory of natural selection associated body hair with ""primitive ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier, 'less developed' forms,"" wrote Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College in Maine. Conversely, having less body hair, the English naturalist suggested, was a sign of being more evolved and sexually attractive.

As Darwin's ideas became popularized, other 19th-century medical and scientific experts began linking hairiness to ""sexual inversion, disease pathology, lunacy, and criminal violence,"" Herzig continued. Interestingly, those connotations were applied mostly to women's body hair, not men's -- not just because of evolutionary arguments but also, the author pointed out, the enforcement of ""gendered social control"" on women's rising role in society. Making women think they had to be hairless to be considered worthy of attention was a heteronormative way of controlling their bodies -- and, inherently, their selves -- through shame, Widdows explained.

By the early 1900s, upper- and middle-class white America increasingly saw smooth skin as a marker of femininity, and female body hair as disgusting, with its removal offering ""a way to separate oneself from cruder people, lower class and immigrant,"" Herzig wrote.

A female 'necessity'

In the first decades of the 20th century, changing fashions -- sleeveless dresses exposing the skin -- further popularized body hair removal in the US.

In 1915, Harper's Bazaar was the first women's magazine to run a campaign dedicated to the removal of underarm hair (""a necessity,"" as it was described). That same year, men's shaving company Gillette launched the first razor marketed specifically for women, the Milady DÃÂ©colletÃÂ©e. Its advert read, ""A beautiful addition to Milady's toilet table -- and one that solves an embarrassing personal problem.""

The shorter hemlines of the 1930s and '40s, and a shortage of nylon stockings during World War II meant more and more American women began shaving their legs, too. The introduction of the bikini in the US in 1946 also led shaving companies and female consumers to focus on the trimming and shaping of their nether regions.

In the 1950s, as Playboy hit the newsstands (its first issue came out in 1953), clean-shaven, lingerie-touting women set a new standard of sexiness. By 1964, 98% of American women aged 15 to 44 were regularly shaving their legs. Wax strips and the first laser hair removal also debuted around then, though the latter was quickly abandoned for its damaging effects on the skin before being reintroduced decades later.

""And yet shaving was far from being as extreme as it is today,"" Widdows said. ""In the late 1960s and 1970s, full bushes were not at all uncommon, even in Playboy. Around that time you also had the second wave of feminism and the spread of hippie culture, both of which rejected hairless bodies. For a lot of women, body hair was symbol of their fight for equality. It wasn't seen as unnatural -- not yet.""

That shift, Widdows said, kicked off in the following decades, with the rising popularity of waxing, pornography and increasingly explicit pop culture. In 1987, seven sisters from Brazil (known as the J Sisters) opened a salon in New York City offering the so-called ""Brazilian"" -- a complete wax hair removal of the genital region. Celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Campbell started doing it. The masses followed suit.

""Removing body hair went from being 'expected' to the norm,"" Widdows explained. ""Being hairless has come to be seen as the only 'natural' and clean way to present the body. Except it really isn't.""

With advertising and media further promoting the ideal of hair-free bodies, the idea that female hair is gross has only grown. In turn, methods to achieve hairlessness have become more precise: The last four decades have seen the ascent of electrolysis, pulsed light and more advanced laser technology.

""Anything associated with the 'abject' -- what we expel from our cultural worlds in order to define ourselves -- arouses disgust, shame and hostility almost by definition,"" Herzig told CNN in an email. ""Visible female body hair certainly tends to be treated as abject today. It's worth noting that those are ideas about cleanliness, contingent social norms, rather than about actually removing 'dirt.' Most hair removal practices tend to introduce new opportunities for abrasion and infection.""

Embracing hairiness

In 2008, Breanne Fahs, professor of women and gender studies at Arizona State University, set female students an assignment to grow their body hair and write a paper reflecting on the experience. Fahs later extended the assignment to include the course's men, who were asked to shave their legs. The project still runs today.

""The assignment has spotlighted the cultural inevitability of female hair removal,"" Fahs said in a phone interview. ""Over the years, those who have taken part in it have shared quite consistent issues: a deep sense of shame, struggle with self-confidence, even social ostracism.

""There have also been cases of heterosexism and homophobia -- this idea that growing your leg hair automatically implies you're queer, or shaving it means you're a gay man. Women often don't realize how much society, family and friends weigh in on what we do with our bodies. And how much of what we think is a choice -- that 'I choose to shave' -- has actually been imparted to and enforced upon us for generations.""

But Fahs also saw feelings of empowerment, rebellion and anger stirring from the project. ""Particularly in the last two years, in the wake of the election and the #MeToo movement -- there's been a deeper awareness of the restrictions surrounding women's bodies, of feminism, gender and sexuality, and a willingness to push back against it all, or at least break out of the comfort zone,"" she said.

It's not just Fahs' students.

A new cohort of young women is embracing body hair, especially on Instagram. The phenomenon has also made it into magazines. In the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, actress Emily Ratajkowski posed with unshaven underarms (a full 360-degree turn for the publication since its early anti-armpit hair messages). YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen and musician Halsey have also showed off their body hair.

Newly launched women's shaving brands are also making a case for female fuzz, and encouraging positive conversations around the topic. The Flamingo razor, from the popular grooming line Harry's, emphasizes the right to choose whether to shave with ad slogans like ""No Waxation Without Representation"" and ""We Are Grow Choice.""

ed diverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness. Direct-to-consumer razor start-up Billie , established in 2017, is another company that's marketing the idea of choice. Rather than showing the perfectly smooth models typical of female shaving ads, its campaigns depictdiverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness.

""For so long, advertising has only reinforced the taboo around the subject,"" said Billie co-founder Georgina Gooley in a phone interview. ""We wanted to actually acknowledge that women have body hair, show it, and say that shaving is a choice. If you want to keep your body hair, we celebrate that. And if you want to remove it, that's fine as well.""

Photographer Ashley Armitage, who worked on the Billie campaigns and artfully depicts body hair on her Instagram account , agrees. ""Body hair is a personal choice,"" she wrote in an email. ""Shaving it, waxing it, or growing it are all valid options, and all up to the individual.""

The idea that not shaving can be a choice may not seem revolutionary, when it comes to normalizing body hair. But it could be an important step towards reframing the issue.

""I think more women are realizing how body hair is deeply connected to gender and power,"" said Fahs. ""The emotional nature of what body hair elicits in people has tremendous potential as a tool for activism and social change.""

Thousands forced to work on Brazil's cattle ranches,"Arapoema, Brazil (CNN) -- In this small town on the edge of Brazil's somewhat lawless agricultural frontier, streets turn to mud under tropical rains and laundry hangs limp in front of cement-box houses.

There's one bank and two churches. But for most folks here, if you want a job, you have to head to one of the nearby cattle ranches - only recently carved out of the steamy Amazon jungle.

Luiz Cardoso da Silva, a 69-year-old ranch hand, has worked on half a dozen. But he hopes to never go back.

""I want to spend more time here at home, maybe line up a little something close to my family. There would be nothing better than that,"" says Seu Luiz, as he is known.

On a recent Saturday, Seu Luiz and several of his children crowded into their kitchen for plates of rice, beans and fried liver. The women perched on rustic wooden chairs in the one-room house and the men squatted out back.

""Anybody who's been in the leopard's mouth is real happy right here,"" Seu Luiz said.

'Treated like animals'

Just three days earlier, Seu Luiz was sleeping on the floor of a cattle corral, surrounded by fetid mud.

He and six relatives had been living and working on the ranch for two years, building fences and weeding pastures. There was no bathroom, just a single outdoor spigot to shower and wash clothes and dishes. Nearby bushes served as a toilet.

That's how they were found when an eight-car convoy, lights flashing, pulled into the ranch. One of the Brazilian mobile units tasked with cracking down on worker exploitation across the country was following up on a tip.

Marcelo Goncalves Campos, a veteran inspector for the Labor Ministry, shook his head as he took notes.

""I've been an inspector for almost 20 years and this is really one of the worst cases I've seen,"" he said. ""They are being treated, without any exaggeration, like animals. Sleeping in the same corral as the cattle.""

Seu Luiz tells inspectors that they haven't received any money for the last two years. He says the ranch owner provides them with food, deducts it from their wages and claims that they ended up owing him money.

""You can't leave because you owe money for the food he's given you, you have a debt."" He says he was afraid for the safety of his family if he left.

Debt bondage is common in Brazil's lawless cattle country, according to the coordinator of this latest operation, Andre Wagner, also from the Labor Ministry.

""You'll see someone working in degrading conditions, with an exhausting work schedule, eating one meal a day, while they don't receive any form of salary or a very small one, because their food and tools are discounted,"" he says.

An uphill fight

In fact, more than 50,000 workers have been rescued from what Brazil defines as slave-like conditions since the mobile units were created in 1995. A third of them came from ranches.

But it's an uphill fight with roughly 25,000 Brazilians lured into slavery every year, according to the Catholic Pastoral Land Commission, or CPT. They also end up working in coalmines, sugar cane fields, urban construction sites and garment factories.

Brazil's resources for fighting exploitation are limited. The number of mobile units - comprised of inspectors, prosecutors and federal police - has fallen to four from eight just a decade ago.

""Our method for fighting slavery is good, but we have very few inspectors,"" says Wagner. ""When the complaints are received at our headquarters in Brasilia, we can't go immediately. The delays mean the conditions might have changed.""

The delays are often five or six months, he says.

'Nobody deserves to live like this'

In the case of Seu Luiz, it's a recent tip - just two weeks old.

On the day the mobile unit shows up, the ranch owner is nowhere to be found and doesn't answer his phone. That makes it hard for them to secure an immediate payout for workers.

But the inspectors gather evidence that can be used in negotiations or an eventual trial, setting up an impromptu office on a patio at the ranch. They log hours of interviews and investigate the owner's assets.

Wagner says financial compensation averages about $2,000 for exploited workers but when the conditions are extreme, it can be 10 times that.

The first priority, however, is removing the family from the ranch.

Maria Dalva Sousa, 18, had been living with her husband and toddler son in a shack on the edge of the corral.

""I just want to get out of here, nobody deserves to live like this,"" she says. ""Look at this mud, only rats can sleep in a place like this.""

Together, they all roll up a couple of foam mattresses, stuff clothes into cardboard boxes and load a stove onto the back of a police pick-up truck. After two years of grinding work on the ranch, these are their few possessions of value.

Cattle country

In northern Brazil, cattle roam the rolling pastures.

Huge swaths of the Amazon rainforest were cut down to create these ranches. At first, farmers were encouraged by the government to settle the land. Then they seized more territory illegally.

The famous grass-fed beef produced on these ranches is a staple at home and an important export for Brazil, accounting for $4.35 billion in revenues in 2016.

Few consumers suspect that extreme labor exploitation is an ingrained part of this culture.

But Xavier Plassat, a French Dominican friar, has dedicated his life to fighting what he calls modern-day slavery in the region.

""The main point about slavery is that someone wants to make a profit with zero cost,"" he says. ""Here, more than anywhere, it is easy to make a profit with zero cost. You are on the frontier of farming, of ranching.""

JUST WATCHED Friar battles labor explotation in Brazil Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Friar battles labor explotation in Brazil 04:31

Plassat, 66, works with the Pastoral Land Commission, coordinating their national campaign against labor exploitation.

He has a network of agents and informants who talk to ranch-hands and send reports of labor abuses to federal authorities. Initially, their tips lead to about a quarter of the mobile unit raids.

This has gotten some of the church activists killed - most notably Dorothy Stang, the American-born nun who was shot and killed in 2005.

""I don't say we want to be martyrs,"" Plassat says. ""But we try to be present to share the suffering and help the workers.""

'Impunity, greed, vulnerability, misery'

Plassat shows us a safe house run by the Pastoral Commission where workers who have been rescued by the mobile units can eat and sleep while they fight for compensation.

He says conditions have improved in the region, but says modern-day slavery is far from being eradicated.

""Slavery is a system and it has several roots: impunity, greed, vulnerability, misery. If you don't address all of it at the same time you will probably have the same persons coming back to the same cycle of enslavement,"" he says.

He is concerned that Brazil could actually be sliding backwards on the issue.

An increasingly powerful rural lobby in the national congress has pushed to relax the country's very broad definition of slave labor while the resources to fight it have shrunk.

One of the main tools used to shame employers into compliance has also been undermined - every year the Labor Ministry publishes a ""Dirty List"" of companies caught exploiting workers. But recently, its publication has been repeatedly blocked or delayed.

Return to slavery?

For Seu Luiz, good news finally comes. The ranch owner's family has agreed to pay the equivalent of $38,000 in back wages and penalties for pain and suffering - to be divided among the seven workers.

Seu Luiz says he'll use it to move out of the one-room house he rents and finally buy a home of his own. Something he hopes will protect his children in the future.

In the meantime, a federal prosecutor has filed criminal charges against the ranch owner. Those charges are currently being reviewed by a judge.

Andre Wagner, coordinator of the Ministry of Labor's Special Mobile Unit operation in Tocantins

For Wagner, the raid was a success. But he says you can never really be sure that you've saved someone.

""It's possible Sue Luiz won't return to these working conditions,"" he says. ""But it's also possible he will. Given his age and his limited professional qualifications, he will continue to be a potential victim of slave labor.""",human

Step into the world of America's most notorious gangster,"Chicago (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ At first glance, the building looks like others in downtown Chicago. Home today to Harry Caray's Steakhouse, its exterior is punctuated by a bright neon sign; for fans of Major League Baseball and the restaurant's namesake, this is a destination.

The restaurant walls are covered in MLB memorabilia and photos of everyone who's visited, from the likes of actress Mila Kunis to former US President Barack Obama.

Though celebrities have graced these hallways the last few decades, there's a deeper and darker history within these walls. If these walls could speak, they'd tell the tale of many a mob operation during the Al Capone era.

Built in 1895, the building sits on Chicago's very first designated block; now one of more than 20,000.

In that time, it's passed through multiple, often notorious owners and lived even more lives. It's been a museum for taxidermy animals, a bootlegged liquor distribution center and housed illegal slot machines.

During Prohibition, it became a speakeasy owned by one of Al Capone's cohorts, Gustav Muller. The location held a dual purpose back then. It was kitty corner to the Cook County Courthouse, which according to the Chicago Tribune, was a frequent haunt for the unwilling Capone.

When Capone's reign of the Chicago underworld came to an end in 1931, his influence did not.

His right-hand man turned mob boss, Frank Nitti, a mobster known by the nickname The Enforcer, bought the building in 1939 and continued to use it to distribute liquor. The fourth floor became Nitti's home.

Every floor of this four-story building has secrets.

The current owners of Harry Caray's Steakhouse have been unearthing these secrets since taking over the building in 1987. More than three decades later, bricked-in walls are still giving way to hidden safes in the bowels of the building.

At basement level, it's eerily quiet. Dark and dusty tunnels run the length the building, leading to what current restaurant owner, Grant DePorter, says was once Chicago's vast underground tunnel system.

It's in the same maze of rooms where DePorter discovered a safe, which once cracked open, contained Frank Nitti's phone book -- a veritable trove of information on all those in positions of power in Chicago at the time.

DePorter's latest discovery, which was made in 2018, is a box behind a bricked-in wall. It's one he has yet to excavate, but aims to do so soon. According to him, drilling holes and taking out bricks can be tricky.

A new use for McDonald's used cooking oil: 3D printing,"New York (CNN Business) Professor Andre Simpson had a problem. The University of Toronto's Scarborough campus was paying through the nose for a crucial material for its 3D printer. Few would have guessed McDonald's would come to the rescue.

Simpson is director of the school's Environmental NMR Center dedicated to environmental research. Central to this research is an analytical tool called the NMR spectrometer. NMR stands for nuclear magnetic resonance and is technically similar to how an MRI works for medical diagnostics.

Researchers at the University of Toronto Scarborough collected waste cooking oil from a McDonald's restaurant and turned it into resin for 3D printing.

""We use the NMR spectrometers to look inside tiny living organisms and understand their biochemical response to their changing environment,"" said Simpson. The overarching aim is to ""help bridge the gap between medical research and the environment.""

Simpson had bought a 3D printer for the lab in 2017. He hoped to use it to build custom parts that kept organisms alive inside of the NMR spectrometer for his research.

But the commercial resin he needed for high-quality light projection 3D printing (where light is used to form a solid) of those parts was expensive.

The unsung car designer who created the DeLorean and James Bond's underwater car,"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

Few other designers have been as influential as Giorgetto Giugiaro in shaping modern automobiles. In a career spanning 64 years he has designed some of the most successful and influential cars in history, ranging from one-of-a-kind exotics to mass market utility vehicles.

He's designed over 200 cars for manufacturers around the world which collectively put over 60 million cars on the road and -- at the age of 81 -- is still working today. Having sold his design practice Italdesign in 2015, he continues to design, now with his son Fabrizio, under the roof of a new firm called GFG Style.

Birth of a legend

Born in 1938 in Garessio, about 60 miles South of Turn, Giugiaro came into the world at the prime time and place for a young boy who would eventually become a gifted designer. Fiat, Italy's flagship automaker, was an hour's drive away and the country's post-war economic boom would coincide with Giugiaro's coming of age. In fact, Giugiaro joined FIAT as early as he possibly could -- when he was just 17 -- but not because he was eager to draw cars.

""I got involved with cars not out of passion, but as a part of my creative process,"" he said in a phone interview from his studio in Moncalieri, just outside Turin.

The Giugiaros were a family of artists and Giorgetto was supposed to pursue a similar path. His father, however, noticed that he had a more technical inclination, and so allowed him to go to art school by day and study technical design in the evenings.

Dante Giacosa, FIAT's technical director, saw some of his car sketches and hired him as a junior designer. ""I joined FIAT in 1955 to have an experience outside of the arts world, not really knowing where it would lead to. This experience was more valuable than a school and gave me confidence to experiment with my creativity.""

After four formative years at Fiat, Giugiaro's work was noticed by Nuccio Bertone, who ran one of several influential coachbuilding ateliers that had sprung up around Turin at the time, including Ghia, Pininfarina and Vignale. Bertone's firm made its name by styling beautiful cars for other manufacturers, and put Giugiaro at work on some forward-thinking projects.

""In 1960 I saw my first prototypes come to life at Bertone: The Gordon-Keeble GT, the Alfa Romeo 2600 and the Giulia GT, which I finished as I was drafted for the then obligatory military service. I was 22.""

After creating cars at Bertone under badges such as BMW, Mazda and Ferrari, Giugiaro switched jobs again in 1965, joining Bertone's competitor Ghia. There, he designed two of his most beautiful cars, the Maserati Ghibli and the De Tomaso Mangusta.

The Mangusta went on to become a minor icon among sports car enthusiasts, although only around 400 were produced. Its passenger doors open normally, the design features gullwing doors for the engine and luggage compartment, a truly unique styling quirk.

In 1967 , aged 29 but with 12 years of work experience, Giugiaro started his own design firm, Italdesign, and moved heavily into mass produced cars, shaping some of the world's most successful people movers. As a designer, this is the type of work he preferred. ""The mass-produced car, as a project, has many variables, including timing, costs, feasibility, directors, marketing -- the creative aspect isn't hard, but the mediation between all these variables is. That makes it more gratifying,"" he said.

""The hedonistic car, the car that everybody wants but nearly nobody can have, is a lot easier do to, because it's created for publicity, it doesn't have to rely on a complex structure.""

In 1974 he was asked to design the successor of the Beetle for Volkswagen. The resulting first generation Golf -- known as the Rabbit in the US -- debuted Giugiaro's ""origami period,"" a new styling sensibility dominated by sharp, angular lines. It would influence car design for generations, and create one of the most resounding success stories in the automotive world: The Golf, currently in its seventh generation, is still the undisputed leader in its sector, with sales to date in excess of 30 million units.

Despite his growing fame, Giugiaro kept a low profile. ""When Volkswagen asked me if I wanted to have a badge on every Golf they built that read 'design by Giugiaro,' I said 'No, thanks.' It would have cost me more to send them thousands of badges every day than the money I got from the entire project! When people buy a car, they don't generally care about who designed it. Cars are not artworks. Art is prestigious, but cars are not.""

Movie icons

Giugiaro applied his sharp-edged, origami style to cars that were meant for wildly different purposes and markets.

In 1976 he designed the Esprit for English automaker Lotus, which became James Bond's car in the following year's ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" famously transforming into a submarine. The very car that was used for the film's underwater scenes was purchased by Elon Musk in 2013 for nearly $1 million.

Shortly after, Giugiaro styled the DeLorean, a 2-door coupe launched in 1981 that was consigned to immortality when Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale picked it as Marty McFly's car for ""Back to the Future"" in 1985. Giugiaro based the DeLorean on the Tapiro, a 1970 concept car he had created for Porsche. It was similarly wedge-shaped and, most importantly, sported a stainless steel body with gullwing doors.

""I didn't expect that it could be picked as a movie car,"" he said. ""Its unpainted look is due to the fact that DeLorean didn't want to spend anything on painting equipment, so he went with stainless steel, but that didn't come without problems. I'm glad when someone remembers that I designed it.""

Around the same time, during a fruitful collaboration with Fiat, he designed the two affordable and compact cars of the 1980s for the Italian automaker: the well-known Uno and the Panda.

With its brutally basic design, Giugiaro's Panda was the opposite of a bedroom poster car in its heyday, but it's now attracting a cult following, the ""4x4"" version especially. In a 1980 interview to Italian newspaper La Stampa, Giugiaro described the Panda as ""a pair of jeans: a simple, practical, no-frills piece of clothing."" He likened the design to that of a military helicopter: ""a light, rational machine designed for a specific purpose.""

More than cars

Giugiaro's designs extend beyond the automotive industry thanks to an industrial design division of Italdesign, launched in 1974. Since then he's designed the Nikon F5 camera trains for the Riyadh metro, a professional coffee machine , a dentist chair, several Beretta guns, sewing machines, watches, tractors, motorbikes and the stadium for Turin's football team Juventus FC, and perhaps the most unexpected -- a pasta shape called Marille.

""These were a great way to fill the dead times between car projects -- but the creative process and technique are exactly the same as a car, there's no difference. It's more liberating, because it lets me escape the normative hell of cars, which are full of rules and regulations,"" said Giugiaro.

Today, Giugiaro is no longer involved with Italdesign, after Volkswagen -- through its subsidiary Audi -- first acquired 90% of its shares in 2010 , then the remaining 10% in 2015 . But he's still designing cars: One of his latest creations, presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2018 in celebration of his 80th birthday, is an electric concept named Sybilla (after his mother, Maria Sibilla).

Whenever he sees one of his own creations on the road, he has a simple thought: ""I notice what I could have done better. I'm always thinking about the future, about doing what I couldn't have done before. So, in a way, I'm constantly working even when I'm not working.""

There is, however, something he would have liked to design but never got the chance to: ""I love the design of modern fighter jets and even space ships that you see in the movies. I would have enjoyed designing a plane.""

(CNN) On March 8, International Women's Day, and as 2020 marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, there are many reasons to celebrate the global progress that has been made on gender equality. Regrettably, this hard-earned progress is being openly challenged. We, the Nordic Prime Ministers, wish to express our grave concern over the current pushback against women's and girls' rights. We have witnessed a surge in regressive policies around the world, often undermining universal human rights.

The Nordic countries' success in promoting gender equality is a result of targeted government policies and strong civil societies, but it is also deeply rooted in international legal frameworks. We therefore wish to reiterate our joint commitment to the protection and promotion of the rights of women and girls, and more generally of universal human rights.

For over 40 years, the Nordic countries have worked collectively to promote gender equality. This has resulted in stronger economies and happier and more prosperous societies. Key public policies include the provision of well-paid, shared parental leave, and universal, affordable, and high-quality child care. When implemented properly, these policies enable women to participate in the labor market and public decision-making processes, while making space for men to share domestic responsibilities. This has positive impact on gender equality at work and at home, and also leads to greater gender equality in public decision-making and a better gender balance among leaders. The private sector must be a part of this. Increasing women's participation and ensuring more diverse leadership have proven not only to be the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do.

However, despite the remarkable progress that has been made, gender-based structural inequalities are still evident across the region. As in other countries, the discrimination multiplies when gender intersects with other protected characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability. As an example, unemployment among women born in countries outside the EU/EEA remains higher than among other groups.

Overall, gendered trends persist in the Nordic labor markets. The majority of teachers and care workers are women, and men are more likely to work in the transport, construction and manufacturing sectors. Men are also overrepresented in leadership positions.

(CNN) The hilariously inept attack on the Washington Post by an organization run by right-wing prankster James O'Keefe -- his latest in a catalog of failures, falsehoods and fraud -- is a ""worst practices"" list of things a true news organization should never, ever do.

O'Keefe has spent years attempting to expose alleged liberal bias in mainstream media organizations, which, in and of itself, is a worthy goal. Every member of a quality news organization -- editors, reporters, producers and executives -- should be prepared to explain and defend their work and methods: what stories we cover, how we do it and what assumptions or hidden biases might lie behind our choices.

But serious media critics have a responsibility, too, one that is equal to, if not greater than, the organizations they wish to expose. That means operating with honesty, fairness and good faith, taking care to back up accusations with concrete evidence.

But O'Keefe, whose website describes him as ""an award-winning journalist,"" is more partisan prankster than honest critic.

21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India,"(CNN) India has once again topped an annual list of cities with the worst air quality in the world, according to a new report, while Chinese cities have continued to show improvements from the previous year.

Twenty-one of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India, according to data compiled in IQAir AirVisual's 2019 World Air Quality Report, with six in the top ten.

Ghaziabad, a satellite city of the capital New Delhi in northern Uttar Pradesh state, is ranked as the world's most polluted city, with an averagePM 2.5 concentration measurement of 110.2 in 2019. That's far more than double the level which the US Environmental Protection Agency regards as healthy -- it's nine times more.

And in November, a public health emergency was declared after the air quality index (AQI) level exceeded 800 in certain parts of New Delhi, which was more than three times the ""hazardous"" level.

Researchers from IQAir -- a global air quality information and tech company -- gleaned data for the report from on the ground monitoring stations that measure levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, per cubic meter.

The microscopic particles, which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are considered particularly harmful as they are small enough to enter deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system.

PM 2.5 includes pollutants such as sulfate, nitrates and black carbon. Exposure to such particles has been linked to lung and heart disorders and can impair cognitive and immune functions.

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths a year globally, mainly as a result of increased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory infections.

It is estimated that more than 80% living in urban areas which monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle-income countries most at risk.

""Air pollution constitutes the most pressing environmental health risk facing our global population,"" the AirVisual report said.

South Asia continues to be of particular concern, with 27 of the 30 most polluted cities in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. Pakistan's Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Raiwind, are among the ten most polluted cities, and the major population centers of New Delhi, Lahore, and Dhaka rank 5th, 12th and 21st respectively, according to AirVisual data.

Regionally, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are worst affected overall, with only six of 355 cities included meeting WHO annual targets, the report said.

However, South Asia has seen improvements from the previous year. National air pollution in India decreased by 20% from 2018 to 2019, with 98% of cities experiencing of varying levels of improvement. The report points to economic slowdown, favorable weather conditions, and efforts towards cleaning the air as reasons behind the decrease.

For example, the most polluted city, Ghaziabad, had an average AQI of 110.2 this year. But in 2018 it was 135.2 and 144.6. in 2017.

The report also points India's launch of the country's first National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) which aims to reduce PM 2.5 and the bigger particulate PM 10 air pollution in 102 cities by 20-30% by 2024 compared to 2017 levels.

Climate crisis and urbanization

The air quality data shows, ""clear indications that climate change can directly increase the risk of exposure to air pollution"" the report said, noting it impacts air quality in many cities through desertification and increased frequency of forest fires and sandstorms.

Greenhouse gas emissions , with the burning of fossil fuel a key driver of the climate crisis, is also a major cause of dirty air.

Many countries are still dependent on coal for their energy production, the biggest contributor to PM 2.5 emissions. China, for example, is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal.

Exacerbating the problem is rapid urbanization in industrializing Southeast Asian cities, which is also a major cause of air pollution and poses severe challenges to managing PM 2.5 levels, the report found.

Indonesia's Jakarta and Vietnam's Hanoi overtook Beijing for the first time among the world's most polluted capital cities, ""in a historic shift reflecting the region's rapid industrialization,"" the report said. The two capitals have annual PM 2.5 levels which are about 20% higher than those of Beijing, according to the report.

""Fast growing cities need to make a choice if they want to grow in a sustainable manner,"" said Yann Boquillod, director of air quality monitoring at IQAir.

However, it's not all bad news. People power is bringing about change, he said.

""Up to recently, growth was more important than the environment, but we're seeing a very clear trend that people are demanding more from their local governments,"" Boquillod said.

""During the year 2019, citizens of Hanoi have massively become aware of the air quality in their city, thanks to the deployment of air monitors. This is an example how air quality data has helped to push government to improve the environment.""

And in the past year residents of Jakarta have sued the government over worsening air pollution in the city.

Jakarta is Southeast Asia's most polluted city and the fifth most polluted capital -- up from 10th position in 2018, according to the report. It's on track to become the world's biggest megacity by 2030, with a population of 35.6 million, according to a 2018 Euromonitor report.

""The city's rapid growth has coincided with heightened PM2.5 levels, as the growing population adds to its notorious traffic congestion, and coal-based energy demand,"" the AirVisual report said.

Bright spots

Chinese cities have overall seen marked improvements in recent years, with average concentrations of pollutants falling 9% from 2018 to 2019, according to the report.

China's capital Beijing has more than halved its annual PM 2.5 levels over the past decade and has dropped out of the world's 200 most polluted cities following concerted efforts to get air pollution under control.

However, 98% of Chinese cities still exceeded WHO guidelines and 47 feature among the top 100 most polluted cities in the 2019 World Air Quality Report

Dust and sandstorms in the desert city of Hotan, in western China's Xinjiang region, make it the world's second most polluted city in 2019, with an average AQI of 110.1.

Another positive is that last year saw a significant increase in countries expanding their air quality monitoring, ""with the number of monitoring stations increasing by more than 200% since the year prior.""

More monitoring data is important to inform communities about the quality of the air they are breathing and helps tackle air pollution globally, the report said.

Continuous public air quality data is now available for the first time for Angola, the Bahamas, Cambodia, DR Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Latvia, Nigeria and Syria, the report found.

Yet there is still a large gap in air quality data for many parts of the world, the report said, meaning the total number of cities exceeding the WHO PM 2.5 threshold could be higher.

For example, Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people, has less than 100 monitoring stations that make air quality data available to the public in real time.

""Often locations bearing the highest particulate pollution levels tend to also notably have the least monitoring data,"" said Frank Hammes, CEO of IQAir. ""Leaving the most vulnerable communities without access to timely and relevant air quality data, necessary to guide actions to safeguard their health.""",human

"Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time","In 2014, President Barack Obama founded the Global Health Security Agenda to rally developed countries to help many of the least-developed countries build their capacities to detect, contain and combat diseases before they spread widely. Under President Trump, much of the funding for the C.D.C., United States Agency for International Development and other agencies for that and related initiatives was cut.

As Mr. ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs national security adviser, I established the office of Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council to monitor, prepare for and prevent global health crises. In 2018, my successor dismantled the office, pushed its leader, Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, out and downgraded the position of Homeland Security adviser. During the transition in January 2017, the Obama team provided briefing papers and conducted a side-by-side exercise with leaders of the incoming Trump administration focused on pandemic threats. Like much of the assistance we offered, it was discarded by the incoming team.

Second, consistent with his nationalistic, xenophobic orientation, Mr. Trump has portrayed the virus that causes Covid-19 as a Ã¢ÂÂforeign virus.Ã¢ÂÂ In reality, viruses know no nationality and respect no borders. Demonizing foreigners, denigrating people of different religions and hues, building walls and restricting immigration are not effective ways to combat a pandemic. Nor do they solve our economic challenges or assuage those uncomfortable with our growing racial diversity.

No American lives have been saved by blaming China for the origin or spread of the virus. A containment strategy predicated on keeping certain foreigners out, if swiftly and properly executed, might have bought American authorities some time to prepare for the inevitable domestic outbreaks, but it could never prevent the emergence of such a highly transmissible disease. Unfortunately, whatever time might have been gained by halting most travel from China was not used to speed domestic preparedness.

In the same vein, Mr. Trump just announced a counterproductive and ineffectual suspension of travel from much of Europe. By refusing to consult or even warn our closest allies, the United States alienated partners whose cooperation we always need to confront global challenges, including the coronavirus. Moreover, the virus is already prevalent across the United States, and its magnitude will only grow. Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs arbitrary travel ban on Europeans, which inexplicably excludes Britain and Ireland, is rife with as many holes as Swiss cheese. Merely another feckless, if costly, way of blaming foreigners for our own problems, it does nothing to address the crisis already in our midst.",human
Bristol sisters aim to raise awareness of 'honour hate',"Image caption Amaleelah wants to raise awareness of ""slut shaming"" in different communities

Two sisters who had experienced ""honour hate"" in their community are to work to raise awareness of it in schools.

Amaleehah and Nadia Aslam-Forrester, from Bristol, were targeted by members of the Asian community for posting photos of themselves in skirts online.

The sisters, who have a Pakistani mother and English father, said they were ""slut-shamed"" for not upholding cultural norms of women's behaviour.

They are now working with a charity to educate young people about the issue.

So-called honour crimes are acts that have been committed to protect or defend the supposed honour or reputation of a family and extended community.

Amaleehah Aslam-Forrester, 22, said the pair had always been creative and would use Instagram to express their love of art, modelling and clothes.

However, they faced a backlash online for the photographs because of what they said were ""deeply ingrained cultural pressures"".

Image copyright Amaleehah Image caption Amaleelah said the ""hate messages"" they received were ""awful""

Their social media presence also alarmed their mother.

Worried about their safety, she put the sisters in touch with Integrate, a youth-led charity in Bristol which has campaigned for gender and racial equality and been supported by Sport Relief.

They attended a series of workshops with other young women about issues including female genital mutilation, sexism and honour-based violence and eventually made a film about the issue.

Amaleehah said: ""In our community, honour lies within the body of a woman.

""There's always pressure on her to uphold men's honour in her behaviour and also in the way she dresses.

'Hate messages'

""We had one case where someone told us to drink bleach [on social media].

""We got a lot of hate messages. Some people were anonymous, making fake accounts. It was awful.

""And that was all because we were being judged, there was stereotyping involved.""

She said ""slut-shaming"" in general was about women's honour and there is no culture in society that does not experience some form of this.

""Integrate gave us a voice in a community that didn't really understand us.""

Amaleehah is now employed to raise awareness of honour hate in all communities in schools across the UK.",human

How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef,"If you've eaten a McDonald's Quarter Pounder recently, you may have noticed that it tastes better than it used to.

It may seem like a simple, obvious decision: Fresh beef gets hotter faster and tastes juicier, delivering a more appetizing burger. Through consumer insights, McDonald's knew that their customers would respond well to the upgrade. And the improved burgers could help McDonald's better compete with its rivals. So-called ""better burger"" chains like Five Guys and Shake Shack have gained traction, raising the bar for mainstream outlets. And the success of fast casual joints like Chipotle and Panera has pushed larger chains to switch to fresher ingredients.

But it took about three years to make the change, and Marion Gross, chief supply chain officer for McDonald's in North America, initially balked at the idea.

""I think I said, 'Not while I'm in this job,'"" Gross told CNN Business's Rachel Crane. She was particularly concerned that introducing a new ingredient Ã¢ÂÂ which has to be handled in a new way Ã¢ÂÂ into McDonald's complex supply chain could also accidentally introduce new risks to food safety in restaurant kitchens. She was skeptical because ""of the enormity of the change that had to be made.""

Gross is responsible for nearly $14 billion in food, equipment and packaging and oversees more than 15,000 restaurants in North America, including roughly 14,000 locations in the United States. The company's supply chain is the mechanism that enables those restaurants to sling burgers, fries and beverages to millions of people every day. It's a carefully calibrated system that includes suppliers, distributors, franchise operators and other stakeholders. Even small changes require a great deal of planning and consideration Ã¢ÂÂ and convincing everyone involved that it's worth making the change. Any tweak to the system increases the likelihood of something going wrong.

Gross, who stepped into the role in 2013, said that a former chair of the McDonald's board once called the company's supply chain a ""daily miracle.""

What he meant, Gross said, is that nobody notices when the supply chain is working properly. But they notice when it breaks down. ""The only time that supply chain even sort of hits anybody's radar is when something goes wrong,"" she said.

Making a change to one of McDonald's signature menu items is particularly risky Ã¢ÂÂ especially if that change could introduce food safety concerns.

From dream to reality

By mid-2015, McDonald's was in a rough spot. Visits to restaurants were down , and same-store sales Ã¢ÂÂ which measure the sales at locations open around a year Ã¢ÂÂ had been down for two years running. The company decided to close 350 underperforming restaurants globally, which was a rare contraction

""Simply speaking, we need to be better at serving hot, fresh food,"" said then CEO Steve Easterbrook during a July 2015 call with analysts.

So the company's leadership set to work on turning the business around. Those efforts included tapping people across the company for ideas on how to make better food.

That year, McDonald's franchise operator Joe Jasper met with chefs, suppliers and McDonald's corporate employees from its business insights and menu marketing teams, among others. That ""food journey"" team, about 20 people altogether, was tasked with figuring out a way to make McDonald's burgers the best among all quick-service restaurants.

McDonald's began serving Quarter Pounders made with fresh beef in its US stores in May 2018. (Taylor Glascock for CNN)

During its first brainstorming session, the group came up with the idea for a hotter, juicier burger, Jasper said. But they didn't land on fresh beef right away.

When Jasper, who at the time owned and operated 20 McDonald's locations in Texas, returned to his team, he brainstormed with them, as well. They agreed that if possible, fresh beef in a Quarter Pounder ""would be amazing.""

So he set to work. Along with two others, Jasper spent three days in one of his kitchens, working about eight to ten hours each day.

The goal was to cook up a hot, juicy burger without making major changes to the kitchen's operating system and without slowing down the drive thru. With those parameters in mind, Jasper and his team had to deliberate over every detail Ã¢ÂÂ from the width and thickness of the patty to the amount of pressure cooks use to sear the burger without drying it out.

""You change one parameter and it changes everything, and so you have to test over and over and over again,"" Jasper said. A few one-off successes weren't enough, he added. ""You have to do something you can replicate. When you start doing the math, it's millions of times a day across our system.""

Once Jasper had figured out how to make the new ingredient work, he invited Gross Ã¢ÂÂ a sponsor of his food journey team Ã¢ÂÂ to one of his restaurants to try it out. When she tasted the fresh beef burger, Gross said, she went from being ""a skeptic to a believer.""

But others remained skeptical.

When McDonald's first started testing out its fresh beef burger in 2016, some franchisees reportedly said they were against the switch. One operator worried about ""an uncaring employee doing something that puts the entire system at risk,"" CNBC reported , citing a survey of about 27 franchisees who together owned and operated roughly 200 restaurants. They pointed to Chipotle, which took a major financial and reputational hit after E. coli outbreaks at its restaurants sickened customers, as a cautionary tale.

""We are the lightning rod,"" the franchisee said, according to CNBC. ""Chipotle will be a walk in the park if we have an incident.""

Franchisees own and operate about 93% of McDonald's restaurants, so getting them on board with the idea was crucial to its success.

Focus on safety

Franchise operators weren't the only ones worried about food safety. That was Gross's main concern about making the switch, too.

""I lost a couple of winks of sleep over that one,"" she said.

Fresh beef is not inherently more difficult to prepare than frozen. But there are important differences between how fresh and frozen meat needs to be handled. Cooks must be mindful of contamination when handling fresh beef Ã¢ÂÂ basically, they need to make sure that raw burger juice doesn't end up in other food or ingredients.

For employees, the new ingredient meant re-learning a skill that may have become second nature, Gross said. ""For years they were used to following the same procedures, and probably most of them could do it in their sleep,"" she noted. ""This was a big change.""

With the guidance of a third-party food safety expert, McDonald's put new practices into place. It instructed employees to wear blue gloves when handling the fresh beef, to make sure that other food products weren't accidentally contaminated. Members of the corporate team made sure that employees at McDonald's thousands of US restaurants had been trained correctly before the launch.

To prepare a fresh beef burger, employees take the patty from the fridge and place it directly on a flat iron grill. While it's cooking, the cook adds a pinch of salt and pepper to bring out flavor. The fresh burgers cook more quickly than frozen ones.

Changes also had to be made on the supply and distribution side.

Suppliers, used to sending frozen patties to McDonald's, needed new packaging equipment and refrigeration capacity, among other things, to make sure the fresh beef was handled safely.

Lopez Foods was the first supplier to sell fresh beef to McDonald's. In order to accommodate the new product, Lopez had to build new lines. That meant new grinders and packaging equipment, among other tools. It converted one of its freezers into a refrigerator to store the meat. Switching from fresh to frozen also means Lopez has to be more nimble with its shipments. With a frozen product, they could plan far in advance for McDonald's promotions that would increase the number of orders. With a perishable product, that planning time shrinks.

And Lopez had to make all of these investments up front, with no guarantee that the changes would yield results.

""It's a big change for us, it's a big change for the restaurant operationally. And there were questions around whether that could be executed,"" said Ed Sanchez, CEO of Lopez Foods. ""I had doubts along the way. But as it progressed along, it was less and less doubt. And there came a point to where it was crystal clear that we had to do this. The customer wanted it.""

Fresh beef has a shorter shelf life than frozen, noted Dale Rogers, professor of logistics and supply chain management at Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business. This means that it needs to be brought from the suppliers to McDonald's more quickly than frozen beef.

Technological innovations, like sensors, can help make it easier for McDonald's to ensure that the beef has been kept at the right temperature throughout its journey, said Rogers. Years ago, it would have been more difficult for McDonald's to make sure that the meat is properly refrigerated all the way through.

Still, it's a major overhaul, he said. But If anyone can pull it off, it's McDonald's.

""It's a very disciplined culture,"" he said. ""McDonald's has had the same suppliers for many, many years,"" he added. ""The relationship is extremely tight."" When it comes to managing its supply chain, ""McDonald's is one of the best of the best,"" said Dale.

To get suppliers on board, Gross started small.

""A lot of that up front was really just getting people comfortable with the idea of a change this big, a move this bold for a company with our scale and our size,"" Gross said.

Gross initially balked at the idea of switching to fresh beef because of the massive changes it would require of the McDonald's supply chain. But after a taste test, she changed her mind. (Taylor Glascock for CNN)

After getting Lopez Foods on board, ""it was time to bring on the next supplier,"" said Gross. ""We had all this learning from Lopez Foods that could very quickly be shared with supplier number two. Then they brought their production lines up and going, and they had a bunch of learning as well.""

Sanchez is pleased with the results of the switch, he said. ""We were satisfied with our investment and our return on investment,"" he noted, adding, ""it grew the business for us.""

Getting its suppliers to work together is a ""competitive advantage,"" said Gross. ""Their interests, like ours, is in the success of the McDonald's system.""

Constant improvement

With its roughly 14,000 US locations and $38.5 billion in 2018 US sales , McDonald's far outpaces its competition. Wendy's, the next biggest burger chain according to QSR Magazine's most recent annual list , closed out 2018 with about 6,700 locations and nearly $10 billion in US sales. Burger King's 7,300 US locations also pulled in about $10 billion in US sales in 2018.

With McDonald's so far ahead, it doesn't really need to worry about the competition, noted Sam Oches, editorial director of Food News Media at QSR magazine. What it does have to worry about is staying relevant.

""You still want your customers to choose McDonald's over Wendy's and Burger King, but you also want your customers to choose McDonald's over Five Guys,"" Oches said.

Better burger and fast casual chains started gaining momentum after the 2008 recession, when people were looking for spots that served higher quality meals than fast food chains but were less expensive than casual restaurants. By 2015, both the fast casual and better burger trends were well established. And burger chains like Wendy's and In-N-Out, which built their reputations on serving fresh beef, were shouting out their message.

""The more that the mass audience is hearing these stories about fresh beef and better burgers, the more that old frozen patty really wasn't going to cut it,"" said Kara Nielsen, a food trend expert based in Oakland, California.

McDonald's has experimented with high-quality and craft burgers, but pricey options haven't worked well for the brand. And complicated burgers may add to prep time, which can mean longer lines and wait times in stores.

Still, McDonald's could have skipped this trend because of its massive scale.

Speaking at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in May 2018, Easterbrook, still CEO of McDonald's at the time, explained why it was so important to figure out a way to improve the chain's burgers.

""We're a burger business at our heart,"" he said. ""If you want to really get the core business growing day in, day out, what changes can you make to the items you sell most of that customers would value?"" By making it's thickest burger, the Quarter Pounder, hotter and juicier, McDonald's can give customers the most bang for their buck.

The fast food chain is constantly trying to improve its menu. ""That includes enhancing or improving, making our iconic burgers and product offerings better too,"" Gross said, noting that making the shift to fresh beef ""was probably the most difficult change that we made since we made the move to all day breakfast.""

For now, the risk is paying off. ""The customers are voting by coming in and visiting us more often,"" said Gross.

""It all goes back to listening to the customer, and what the customer wants, and how their needs and wants are changing,"" she said. ""Then us being able to demonstrate that number one, we're listening to them. Number two, we're taking action and we're making the moves that are important to them, even with our iconic food product.""",human

Splayed Roast Chicken With Caramelized Ramps Recipe,"It may not seem possible to improve on roast chicken cooked in a very hot cast-iron skillet, an easy method that yields a moist, evenly cooked bird. (The thighs, which needs more cooking time, are pressed against the pan, which allows them to cook as quickly as the breast meat.) But hereÃ¢ÂÂs a recipe with a clever tweak on that method, one thatÃ¢ÂÂs easier than spatchcocking (or butterflying) the chicken, and that makes for a even faster-cooked, juicier bird. Preheat the skillet in a 500-degree oven for about 45 minutes, letting it get blisteringly hot. Meanwhile, take the chicken and snip the skin that connects the legs to the body, splaying the legs open until you feel the joints pop on both sides. Very carefully transfer the chicken to the pan, pressing the legs down into the surface. Ramps, garlic and capers tossed into the pan juices toward the end of the roasting time make for a bright, sweet and salty sauce. A cast-iron skillet is a must here, and if you donÃ¢ÂÂt have one, itÃ¢ÂÂs a worthwhile, and inexpensive, investment.

Tom Blachford's upside-down urban landscapes will make you look twice,"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

These nocturnal urban landscapes, glistening in purple and indigo hues, may well look like a patchwork of different cities, mixed together to create the ultimate sci-fi metropolis.

But they are, in fact, single exposure images taken from a rooftop in the Australian city of Melbourne -- then simply flipped upside down.

""They really look like they're composites of lots of images, but they're just one single shot and all I've done is turn them 180 degrees,"" said photographer Tom Blachford in a phone interview.

""I was amazed at the first image I took, I just couldn't believe how much it looked like this crazy collage of some dystopian future world. And I got really fascinated with how rotating an image could completely change its composition, completely break your brain's way of looking at it.""

Tom Blachford

Blachford, who's from Melbourne, said the images are inspired by the works of Dutch artist M.C. Escher, famous for his mind-bending experiments with perspective and optical illusions, as well dystopian sci-fi films like ""Blade Runner"" -- depicting a futuristic Los Angeles under perennial night-time rain -- and ""Akira,"" a Japanese animated film from 1988 that has become a cult classic.

""There's quite a few scenes in 'Akira' where the city is upside down that they just don't explain. The city just flips for no reason -- I love that it's sort of in the background and nobody notices,"" said Blachford.

Tom Blachford

The images were all shot from the top of a building in central Melbourne. A crucial component was the absence of wind. ""You need a really still night, because doing long exposures on a tripod, 55 floors up, any wind is going to be massively amplified and it's going to shake your camera around,"" said Blachford.

The colors in each image are then corrected in post-production. ""Everything's very stained with neon, with colors, it was about restricting the color palette and doing a color treatment and grade on it that pushed things towards more of a purple, magenta and blue kind of spectrum.""

Tom Blachford

The series includes eight images, which are being exhibited in Melbourne, where some people have struggled to recognize their own city. ""Most people think that this is a continuation of my Tokyo series , even people who live here think that these are images from Tokyo,"" Blachford said. ""It's been really interesting to show people the city that they know, but literally from a perspective that they never really considered.""

Tom Blachford

For the exhibition space, Blachford has also created sculptures derived from the photos.

""I taught myself CAD (computer-aided design) and bought a 3D printer. I've built what are essentially 3D printed buildings inside an infinity box, which is suspended from the ceiling. When you look up into it, it looks like these tiny buildings go on forever above you,"" he explained.

Tom Blachford

The ultimate goal of these images, Blachford said, is to show the camera's ability to confuse our senses.

""To me that's the most interesting thing about photography and shooting at night, that the camera becomes this bridge to another world that's just out of reach of our senses. It's too dark, it's too far away, it's too bright, and we just can't process it in that way,"" he said.

""But the camera lets me distill that into something that you can see and experience.""",human
"4 of your latest coronavirus questions, answered","(CNN) CNN readers are asking smart questions about coronavirus every day. So each weekday, we'll select some of the top questions and get you the answers.

Here are some of the most popular recent questions:

Q. Does donated blood get screened for coronavirus?

At least 4.5 million Americans need donated blood every year , but this is the first time novel coronavirus has been a concern in the nation's blood supply.

""Individuals are not at risk of contracting COVID-19 through the blood donation process or via a blood transfusion since respiratory viruses are generally not known to be transmitted by donation or transfusion ,"" said the AABB , formerly the American Association of Blood Banks.

""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to report that there have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19 to date,"" the group said.

""In addition, no cases of transfusion-transmission were ever reported for the other two coronaviruses that emerged during the past two decades (SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and MERS-CoV, which causes Mideast Respiratory Syndrome).""

The AABB said routine screening measures are already in place to prevent anyone with clinical respiratory infections from donating blood.

But there is one big concern involving blood donations and coronavirus: the possibility that fewer people will come out to donate.

""If the outbreak of coronavirus continues to spread, additional challenges may arise, which could potentially reduce the number of eligible donors,"" the AABB said.

Q. How do I stay healthy when using Uber or Lyft?

Both rideshare companies said they're actively trying to protect customers and drivers from coronavirus.

Uber said it is trying to give drivers with disinfectants to help keep their cars clean, and the company ""may temporarily suspend the accounts of riders or drivers confirmed to have contracted or been exposed to COVID-19.""

Uber said it's working with public health organizations who might tell them to pause an account. If that happens, Uber would suspend that account and those of any connected riders.

Lyft announced a similar policy: ""If we are notified of a rider or driver testing positive for COVID-19, they will be temporarily suspended from using Lyft until they are medically cleared.""

Both Lyft and Uber also said they will protect drivers financially if they are asked to isolate themselves.

""Any driver or delivery person who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is individually asked to self-isolate by a public health authority will receive financial assistance for up to 14 days while their account is on hold,"" Uber said.

""We've already helped drivers in some affected areas, and we're working to quickly implement this worldwide.""

Q. How can I tell whether I have coronavirus or the flu? What are the different symptoms?

Testing is the only way to know for sure. But there have been problems with coronavirus testing -- from faulty test kits to major shortages and delays in getting tested

The flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms, such as fever and cough, but shortness of breath is a common hallmark of coronavirus.

Of course, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms at all. And asymptomatic people can still spread coronavirus to others.

So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Q. Can hand dryers kill coronavirus?

No, bathroom hand dryers can't kill coronavirus, the World Health Organization says. Doctors say the best ways to protect yourself include:

-- Washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds . If you can't wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand santizer.

-- Avoiding large crowds.

-- Staying at least 3 feet away from anyone who might be infected, especially if they're coughing or sneezing.

These people could make Trump's life miserable,"Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) In 2016, Donald Trump did his best to tarnish his opponent Hillary Clinton with an email ""scandal"" that amounted to nothing. In his 2020 reelection campaign, Trump's team has worked to conjure a similar cloud of controversy over Joe Biden's son Hunter, all without producing evidence of wrongdoing.

But now that Biden is fighting to save his candidacy, the President may have to prepare for a complicated set of competitors -- including Michael Bloomberg, a deci-billionaire who is spending whatever it takes to win; Bernie Sanders, a ""Democratic socialist"" who won the New Hampshire primary and has the allegiance of many young voters; and Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, two fresher faces with growing support.

This week, Democratic candidates will appear in CNN town halls and face off in a debate in Las Vegas days before Saturday's Nevada caucus.

The previously ""unelectable"" Mike Bloomberg is being given a serious look by Democrats, wrote Joe Lockhart. The former New York mayor is ""charisma challenged,"" has taken controversial stances, and in many quarters is seen as a symbol of the unaccountable one percent, Lockhart noted.

Arick Wierson, but he should think twice before accepting. ""Holding his own on next week's national stage would be a boon to the campaign, but the chances of him coming off as dry, lacking empathy, and somewhat mechanical loom large... Bloomberg may soon qualify for his first debate, wrote his former aide, but he should think twice before accepting. ""Holding his own on next week's national stage would be a boon to the campaign, but the chances of him coming off as dry, lacking empathy, and somewhat mechanical loom large... Bloomberg is not exactly a warm and fuzzy guy . He has a good sense of humor, but it's dry and a bit racy, meaning it rarely comes out in a public forum. He can appear stiff -- possibly why President Trump has taken to Twitter to troll the former mayor, tweeting that he 'can't debate and has zero presence.' ""

Jill Filipovic to write, "" Bloomberg has been effusively apologizing for his ""stop and frisk"" program in New York City. Last week, a 2015 audio recording resurfaced, with the former mayor speaking about crime in minority neighborhoods, promptingto write, "" These statements should be disqualifying for Bloomberg on their face: We definitely don't need another president who uses racist scare tactics and outlandishly false claims to justify his bad policy goals.""

Tara Setmayer, but time is running out: ""Months of the Republicans' constant drumbeat of blatant falsehoods and character assassination against Biden and his son Hunter throughout the impeachment trial, without an aggressive strategy from Biden to get ahead of it, has apparently worked. Biden's inability to seize control of the narrative and effectively mount an offense may have mortally wounded his candidacy. Biden, the Democrats' onetime frontrunner, still has a shot, argued, but time is running out: ""Months of the Republicans' constant drumbeat of blatant falsehoods and character assassination against Biden and his son Hunter throughout the impeachment trial, without an aggressive strategy from Biden to get ahead of it, has apparently worked. Biden's inability to seize control of the narrative and effectively mount an offense may have mortally wounded his candidacy. If Biden loses South Carolina, it's over .""

Uncle Joe goes negative

Lockhart said it was ""off brand"" for Uncle Joe to attack a fellow Democrat that way. Even worse, he wrote, it was ""a week too late. The campaign had to have seen the momentum Buttigieg was building in Iowa. Waiting until a rival wins, or co-wins, the first campaign test In the days before the New Hampshire primary, Biden rolled out a slashingly negative ad about former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.said it was ""off brand"" for Uncle Joe to attack a fellow Democrat that way. Even worse, he wrote, it was ""a week too late. The campaign had to have seen the momentum Buttigieg was building in Iowa. Waiting until a rival wins, or co-wins, the first campaign test makes the negative attack seem desperate, rather than strategic .""

Errol Louis. Buttigieg now leads the field in total delegates and placed just behind Sanders in New Hampshire, while Biden came in fifth, behind Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. ""Any lingering sense of Biden's inevitability or electability died in the Granite State,"" wrote

David Gergen. "" Sanders was widely proclaimed the frontrunner after Tuesday's primary, but without scoring a dominating victory. The Vermont senator deserves congratulations for being the ""most popular socialist in American history,"" wrote. "" But he may have crested in the 2016 campaign. After all, he won New Hampshire by over 20 points then against Hillary Clinton; this time, he won New Hampshire by less than 2 percentage points. And across most of the Democratic Party, strategists are worried about his chances against President Donald Trump. To them, he is the Jeremy Corbyn (leader of Britain's Labour Party) of the American left.""

Alice Stewart ""is the candidate to keep an eye on... His moderate views and new generation of leadership is Mayor Pete, wrote""is the candidate to keep an eye on... His moderate views and new generation of leadership is a more viable pathway to a new majority for the Democratic Party .""

Buttigieg was the target of a ""homophobic rant"" from Rush Limbaugh, the radio host recently awarded the Medal of Freedom by Donald Trump, noted LZ Granderson.

Limbaugh talked of ""the discomfort some voters would experience watching Buttigieg kiss his husband on the debate stage, especially if he's standing next to, as he put it, 'Mr. Man, Donald Trump.' As offensive as Limbaugh's remarks about Buttigieg were (and as ironic as his holding up Trump as the epitome of manliness were, considering it was the gay dude who volunteered to fight for this country and the straight one who pleaded 'bone spurs'), the reality is homophobia is not theoretical...it is actively practiced.""

Southern strategy

After Nevada, the Democratic primary heads south, beginning with South Carolina Feb. 29. ""Come on down, y'all,"" wrote former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. ""Now that almost 2% of delegates have been awarded from two very white states, attention will quickly shift to my neck of the woods,"" he noted.

""There are states with major delegate hauls. And states where black and brown voters will play a huge role...ultimately, southern Democrats are pragmatists. They want someone who can beat Trump and restore sanity to the White House.

Oh, and the food. ""The southern food culture is strong, from Texas, Memphis and Carolina BBQ to the Deep South's soul food to the shrimp and grits of the Low Country. So be prepared to eat.""

Why prosecutors quit Roger Stone case

The notorious political trickster and Trump acolyte Roger Stone faces sentencing Thursday on charges of lying to Congress, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

It was not surprising last week when President Trump tweeted that the recommended prison sentence being sought by the Justice Department was ""horrible and very unfair."" But it was a stunning departure from Justice Department practice when the department's leadership overruled the four prosecutors who tried Stone and recommended a more lenient sentence.

Carrie Cordero, a former Justice official, wrote, ""Four federal prosecutors didn't withdraw from the case against Roger Stone Tuesday because they had a substantive disagreement with their management. Four prosecutors withdrew from the case , a former Justice official, wrote, ""Four federal prosecutors didn't withdraw from the case against Roger Stone Tuesday because they had a substantive disagreement with their management.

Trump and Attorney General William Barr, Frida Ghitis wrote, ""were following along a well-trod path across history: the systematic crushing of the independence of the judiciary. We have seen this movie before. It doesn't end well."" She added, that it ""has been the course charted by malign populists across the political spectrum, on the left and on the right. We saw it in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and in Vladimir Putin's Russia -- and too many others.""

As lawyers around the country objected to the Justice Department's actions, Barr observed that Trump's tweets were making his job impossible. But the White House seemed to have known Barr's complaint was coming.

""Claims that the Justice Department's decision had nothing to do with Trump's wishes takes Americans for fools, "" Ghitis wrote.

Republican commentator Alice Stewart has a special vantage point on Roger Stone. As communications director for Ted Cruz' presidential campaign, she saw the damage wrought by false stories spread by Stone. ""The personal character assassinations are just a small fraction of Stone's life's work dedicated to political destruction,"" Stewart wrote.

""It's fully appropriate for Stone's character history to be considered in the upcoming sentencing. Understanding full well that a presidential pardon is likely on the horizon, I encourage Judge (Amy) Jackson to lean on the high end of the guidelines and let the chips fall where they may .""

Payback tour

The Justice Department's about-face came after Trump started rooting out those who testified during his impeachment hearings. Elie Honig argued that Trump's dismissal of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman amounted to criminal witness retaliation.

""Trump himself publicly admitted that his purpose was to retaliate , directly mentioning Vindman's testimony as a cause for the move; Vindman 'reported contents of my 'perfect' calls incorrectly,' said Trump. When asked if Vindman deserves disciplinary action, Trump said that the decision lies with the military. And Donald Trump Jr. outright gloated in a tweet, delighting in the vengeful nature of the removals of two decorated military veterans.""

Traditionally, such officers have not taken political positions, even in retirement.""

The real George Washington

""You Never Forget Your First,"" is the clever title of a new biography of George Washington by Alexis Coe. In honor of President's Day, Jane Greenway Carr interviewed the author and noted, Coe ""is the first woman to write a book about America's first president in nearly half a century.""

Carr wrote, ""If you're a lover or student of American history, you'll learn immediate bite-sized lessons from the book's first pages, replete with a ledger of 'Lies We Believe About the Man Who Could Not Tell Them' and lists of Washington's favorite things, animals, frenemies and pettiest acts. Here's why that's brilliant: You already know he won the American Revolution, and if you've listened to or seen 'Hamilton,' you know he did it with no navy and an army that was outgunned and outmanned.

""But did you know that Washington was a honey-obsessed surrogate father of four who named one of his dogs Cornwallis and ended up estranged from nearly every other revolutionary boldfaced name? After reading Coe's book, you feel like you know him -- his family, his desires, how he failed and grew and became the man who is on our money and inextricable from our national identity,"" Carr observed.

As immersed as Coe became in the life of Washington, she told Carr she wants to keep a little distance. ""I know that a lot of biographers in the introduction to their books write about what they do on Washington's birthday or how they grew up with him or have a personal relationship with him,"" Coe noted. ""I didn't have that -- and I really plan to keep it that way. Also, I promised my husband no more Washington.""",human
Ellie and Nele: From she to he - and back to she again,"Studies suggest that most people who transition to another gender do not have second thoughts. But after two trans men met and fell in love, their personal gender journeys took an unexpected turn, to a destination neither had foreseen.

""I always felt we have a very special history. We have special bodies, and a special connection based on the physical experience we had.""

Ellie is 21 and Belgian. Her German partner, Nele, is 24. Both took testosterone to become more masculine, and they had their breasts removed in double mastectomy surgery. Now they have detransitioned, and live again as female - the gender they were assigned at birth.

""I'm very happy I didn't have a hysterectomy,"" reflects Nele. ""It means I can stop taking hormones, and my body will return to looking feminine.""

Last year, they both made the decision to end their use of testosterone and start using the female pronouns ""she"" and ""her"" again. Slowly their own natural oestrogen has begun to re-feminise their bodies.

""I'm very excited to see the changes,"" says Ellie.

Their faces have softened, their bodies become curvier. But years of taking testosterone has had one profound, irreversible effect.

""My voice will never come back,"" says Nele. ""I used to love singing and I can't sing any more - like my voice is just very monotone, it works very differently. When I call someone on the phone, I get gendered as male.""

The stories of these two young people are complex.

They may not be typical of people who have transitioned to another gender. And they are not a judgement on the decisions of other trans people, be they trans men, trans women or non-binary.

Ellie does not remember being uncomfortable as a girl when she was a child. But that changed as she became adolescent.

""I realised I was doing a lot of boy things, and some people weren't fine with that - especially other kids. I remember being called things like 'hermaphrodite'.""

Tall and athletic, Ellie's love of basketball was identified as, ""a boy thing"" too. At 14, she realised she was attracted to other girls, and later came out to her parents.

""I was dating girls and happy about it,"" she says.

Then Ellie told her sister she was a lesbian.

""My sister told me she was proud of the woman I was becoming. And somehow that rang a bell for me. And I remember thinking, 'Oh, so I'm a woman now? I don't feel comfortable with that.' It wasn't that I wanted to be a boy - I just didn't want to be a woman. I wanted to be neutral and do whatever I wanted.""

At 15, Ellie believed becoming a woman might limit her choices in life. For Nele too, growing up female was not fun.

""It started with puberty, when I was around nine years old - with getting breasts before I even realised what it means to have them. My mother forbade me from going outside bare-chested. We had a lot of fights because I was like, 'Why can my brother go out bare-chested?' Obviously, my mother wanted to protect me, but I couldn't understand at the time.""

As Nele matured, there were also lecherous men to contend with.

Image copyright Nele Image caption Nele as a teenager, a trans man, and today

""I experienced a lot of catcalling. There was a street next to mine, and I couldn't go down there without a man hitting on me. I'm slowly realising now that I internalised all of that - that I was perceived in society as something sexy, something men desire, but not a personality.""

With her body developing fast, Nele saw herself as too large. She would later develop an eating disorder.

""Too fat, too wide - the thoughts about needing to lose weight started very early.""

Nele was attracted to women, but the thought of coming out as a lesbian was terrifying.

""I really had this image that I would be this disgusting woman, and that my friends wouldn't want to see me anymore because they'd think I might hit on them.""

At 19, Nele came out as bisexual - that seemed safer. But the experience of unwanted male attention and the discomfort she felt with her female body stayed with her. Nele fantasised about removing her breasts. Then she learned trans men get mastectomies.

""And I was like, 'Yeah, but I'm not trans.' And then I was like, 'Maybe I could fake being trans?' And then I was doing a lot of research and I realised a lot of those things trans men say are very similar to what I experienced - like 'I always felt uncomfortable with my body, and as a kid I wanted to be a boy.'""

The distress trans people feel because there is a mismatch between their gender identity and their biological sex is called gender dysphoria. Nele thinks her own dysphoria began around this time.

""I thought, actually, 'I don't have to fake being trans. I am transgender.'""

Nele could see only two options - transition or suicide. She sought help from a transgender support organisation. They sent her to a therapist.

""When I arrived, I was like, 'Yeah, I think I might be trans.' And he directly used male pronouns for me. He said it was so clear I'm transgender - that he's never been as sure with anyone else.""

Within three months, Nele was prescribed testosterone.

Ellie too became determined to access male hormones - in her case when she was just 16.

""I watched some YouTube videos of trans guys who take testosterone, and they go from this shy lesbian to a handsome guy who is super-popular. I liked thinking of myself having that possibility - it felt like I should have a male body.""

But being so young, she needed parental approval for any medical intervention. The first doctor she visited with her parents said Ellie should wait - she thought that was transphobic and found another medic who was positive about her desire to transition.

""He told my parents that all the effects were reversible - which is the biggest lie. I had done my research, and I knew that this doctor could not be trusted. But I was just so happy that he said that, because then my parents were OK with it.""

Ellie's dad, Eric, was worried about the impact testosterone would have on his child's health, but the doctor reassured him.

""We were still in shock from having a girl who wanted to be a boy,"" he remembers. ""And the doctor said hormones would be better for her.""

Eric and Ellie's mum felt all at sea in this new world of changing genders.

""I would've liked to have met someone to give me the words and find arguments to make her wait and think about it longer, but there was no-one,"" he reflects.

At first, testosterone made Ellie feel emotionally numb. Then she felt much better. At 17, she had a double mastectomy. Later, she graduated from high school, and left Belgium to go to university in Germany.

Transitioning to male had not ended Nele's feelings of despair. She was still suicidal, and her eating disorder was manifesting itself in extreme calorie-counting, and an obsession with her diet. Nele began to think testosterone was the only good thing in her life - and she still wanted a mastectomy. But she did not feel she could be totally honest with her gender therapist.

""I was very ashamed of my eating disorder. I mentioned it in the beginning, but I didn't dare talk about it more because of the shame - I think that's normal with eating disorders.""

Nele was worried her transgender treatment might be halted if there was any doubt about her mental health.

""It's a very tricky situation in Germany, because the therapist is the one who gives you the prescriptions for hormones and for surgery.""

There are few studies exploring the link between eating disorders and gender dysphoria. One review of the UK's Gender Identity Development Service in 2012 showed that 16% of all adolescent referrals in that year had some kind of ""eating difficulty"". But bear in mind that most referrals are young people assigned female at birth - natal girls, as they are called, who are more vulnerable to eating disorders than their natal male counterparts.

Brian and Daniel have been on a similar journey to Ellie and Nele but from a different starting point. Both were assigned male at birth, transitioned to female, and later detransitioned to become male again.

Some clinicians have suggested that eating disorders develop as a response to gender dysphoria, says Anastassis Spiliadis, a UK-based psychotherapist who treats patients with eating disorders and gender identity issues.

The theory is that if you treat the gender distress, the eating disorder will diminish. This can happen, but it is not what Spiliadis has seen among many of his clients - natal females in their 20s who, like Nele, are detransitioning.

""They thought transitioning to a different gender would alleviate the eating disorder and the dysphoria, but things have been much more complex. They regret the decision to take testosterone and have surgery. But what's really worrying is that some of them still have an eating disorder.""

He believes someone who is suffering from anorexia or bulimia may not be equipped to make irreversible health decisions.

""We know that eating disorders affect people at a bio-psychosocial level. Those who are medically and physically, but also cognitively compromised might have a distorted view of themselves or their bodies.""

Spiliadis believes good practice in this field should mean screening young people with gender identity issues for eating disorders. And because they are life-threatening, eating disorders should be treated before responding medically or surgically to the distress caused by gender dysphoria.

As a new student and trans man in Germany, Ellie thought her own dysphoria was a thing of the past, and she was getting on with life.

""I was passing as a man - I was passing so well. I got so many comments from people telling me my transition was such a success, because they couldn't tell I was trans.""

But an ambivalence about her male identity crept in.

""I started to feel like I had to hide so many aspects of my life, and not talk about my childhood as a girl. I didn't feel comfortable being seen as a cis man, and I started to feel like I didn't fit in anywhere.""

Transgender or trans - a person whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth

Cisgender or cis - a person whose gender identity does not differ from their assigned sex at birth

Non-binary - a person who doesn't identify as only male or only female

Pansexual - a person attracted to others regardless of their sex or gender identity

Beyond 'he' and 'she': The rise of non-binary pronouns

Dating was problematic.

""I wasn't comfortable dating women because I didn't want to be taken for a straight guy. And this discomfort I had with my own body partsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Well, I started to see female bodies as less good-looking, less valuable in a way.""

Ellie began to be attracted to men and identified as pansexual.

""I think that came about because of internalised misogyny. But I never really felt any connection with any cis men. Then I thought, maybe dating another trans man would make me feel close to someone and attracted at the same time.""

Did it work?

""It totally worked!""

So Ellie went on a dating app and met Nele - who was not especially looking for romance with another trans man.

""But it was definitely a plus when I started texting with Ellie. We share a lot of experiences, and I feel very comfortable around her.""

Image copyright Nele

After a first date in DÃÂ¼sseldorf, their relationship moved swiftly. Nele got the go-ahead for a long-desired mastectomy, and Ellie was a great support. The couple moved into a flat together.

And it was around this time that Ellie, a gender studies student, became interested in the culture war between trans activists and radical feminists that often erupts in the social media ether.

She started to question whether she was really transgender. ""Or is this just a way I found to go through life?"" she wondered.

Ellie and Nele had intense discussions about their own identities.

And there was something else - both were diagnosed with vaginal atrophy, a soreness and dryness commonly found in menopausal women, but also a side-effect of taking testosterone. The remedy was oestrogen cream.

""But it didn't really help,"" says Nele. ""And I thought, 'I'm putting my body full of hormones, when my body can make those on its own.'""

Ellie felt the same way.

""Isn't it worth trying to go natural for a bit, and just see how it goes?"" she thought.

That is when they stopped taking testosterone. But the decision to detransition was daunting.

""I was afraid of ending the hormones and going back to my body. I didn't even know my natural body because I transitioned so early,"" says Ellie.

""The thought of going back was scary, because I transitioned to escape my problems. Detransitioning means facing the things I never managed to overcome,"" says Nele.

There is little academic research about detransition. The studies that have been done suggest the rate of detransition is very low - one put the proportion of trans people who return to the gender they were assigned at birth at less than 0.5%. But so far, researchers have not taken a large cohort of transitioning people and followed them over a number of years.

""The longitudinal studies just haven't been done,"" says Dr Catherine Butler, a clinical psychologist at the University of Bath.

""But on social media - for example on Reddit - there's a detransitioning group that has over 9,000 readers. There will be academics like myself who are part of that, but even so, it is a huge number of people.""

The lack of academic research in this area has an impact for those re-thinking their gender journeys.

""It means there aren't guidelines or policy that informs how statutory services can support detransitioners. So they've had to self-organise, to establish their own networks,"" she says.

And that is what Nele and Ellie did. Using Nele's skills as a professional illustrator, they created post-trans.com - an online space where people like them can get in touch and share their experiences.

Image copyright Nele Image caption Illustration by Nele, on the post-trans.com website she set up with Ellie

Both of these young people are conscious of how stories of detransition have been used by transphobic organisations and commentators to invalidate the experience of trans and non-binary people, and attack their hard-fought access to health care. Neither Ellie nor Nele deny the rights of trans people. They do, however, question whether transition is always the right solution.

Now, just months into their detransition, they are adjusting to life as female and lesbian. And so are their friends and family.

""It was hard for her to call us and tell us,"" says Eric, Ellie's father, who is still getting used to using female pronouns for his once-again daughter.

""It's not black or white for me. I knew from the start when she first transitioned she would never be a man - she never had the idea of having the complete operation. So now it's a new in-between somewhere, but it's always her.""

So does his daughter regret her choices - her mastectomy, for example?

""All those physical changes I experienced during my transition helped me develop a closer relationship with my body - they're just part of my journey,"" says Ellie.

Nele is similarly sanguine.

""Bodies change through ageing and accidents - I don't feel sad my breasts are gone.""

Neither plans to have reconstructive surgery. More difficult sometimes is the experience of once again being gendered as female - especially by men on lonely station platforms at night, who might be a threat.

""Because if he perceives me as a man, I wouldn't feel thatÃ¢ÂÂ¦ But if I'm seen as a woman, maybe I'm in danger and have to watch out,"" says Nele.

But her experience - from ""she"" to ""he"" and back to ""she"" again - has also had a positive impact, especially on Nele's career.

""I always perceived myself as, 'Well, I'm just a girl who draws - I couldn't be a professional, self-employed illustrator.' And then I transitioned to become a man, and suddenly I was like, 'Oh, I can do those things.' It's something I hear a lot, that trans men feel more confident. I had the same experience. So I will take that and keep it.""

Ellie and Nele boarded a gender rollercoaster when they were still teenagers. It has not been an easy ride.

Now they are moving on, looking forward to life - perhaps with the addition of some pet cats.

Ellie and Nele approve of the use of female pronouns to refer to them throughout their lives, including when they were living as trans men.

30 top takes of 2017,"(CNN) In a year dominated by the beginning of the Trump presidency, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the man occupying the highest office in the land. But Donald Trump's many actions and tweets weren't the only subjects of interest. Stories of racism and white supremacist groups, workplace sexual harassment, freedom of the press and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too.

Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2017.

David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact

January 31

I woke up this morning as an alternative fact.

In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the President's chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings ""all the time.""

That is simply not true.

As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the United States would pursue in the war with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the President's decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it.

Dean Obeidallah: Donald Trump's most bone-chilling tweet

February 6

Dean Obeidallah

Here is Trump's truly jaw-dropping tweet from Saturday morning: ""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!""

Why is this so concerning? It's OK to argue about whether the judge should or shouldn't have issued this order. But Trump is apparently attempting to delegitimize our federal judiciary by calling Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush-appointed judge, a ""so-called"" judge while arguing that his decision is ""ridiculous.""

Let's be blunt, because the stakes demand it: An independent federal judiciary is our last, best hope at preventing Trump from violating the US Constitution and illegally grabbing power. And Trump has to understand that, hence his attempt to undermine it.

George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past

February 19

George Takei

I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.

I remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.

That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion.

Peter Bergen: Why the 'mother of all bombs' and why now?

April 13

Peter Bergen

The dropping of a ""mother of all bombs"" Thursday by the United States on an ISIS cave and bunker complex in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan should be understood as part of an effort to reverse a war that is not going well for the Afghan government and, by extension, the United States.

The non-nuclear 21,600-pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) ""targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.

Thursday's bombing had a feeling of deja vu. A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15,000 pound ""Daisy Cutter"" bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001. Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region.

Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights

April 19

Nikki Haley

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the US ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

John McWhorter: A man who is tragically unfit to be president

May 2

John McWhorter

When President Donald Trump revealed that he doesn't know why the Civil War was fought, or at least figures it could have been averted by the kind of deal-making he supposedly excels at, it was revealing in ways beyond the ones easy to glean.

The ignorance is, as usual, stunning for someone in the public spotlight. ""People don't ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?"" Trump asks rhetorically, which is like saying no one has bothered to study anatomy or physics.

Yet this sort of thing should no longer surprise us from this man. He doesn't read and lacks curiosity, but that's hardly rare among human beings. A college teacher friend of mine the other day noted that no one in his class could name who was president in the 1980s, nor, upon being told who it was, could they name his political party. People like this don't mysteriously develop an interest in civics after college. Sometimes they become president.

Michael D'Antonio: The little boy president

May 16

Michael D'Antonio

Like most little boys, Donald Trump can be disarmingly honest, as when he once said, ""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same. The temperament is not that different."" The trouble is that the first grader is now President of the United States, and his temperament is on display for the world to see.

Unpredictable, impulsive and immature, Trump acts in a way that would be expected of a 6-year-old boy, but is terrifying in a man whose moods dictate decisions carried out by adults on behalf of the most powerful nation in the world.

Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey offers a sterling example of the childish -- and reckless -- Trump style. When Comey broke with bureau tradition and spoke negatively about Trump's rival in the election, though initially he was criticized by candidate Trump, he was later praised -- and effusively. Over and over again, the soon-to-be-president described how Comey had done the right thing in criticizing Hillary Clinton. Comey remained in Trump's good graces after he was inaugurated, and Trump's team expressed confidence in him up until last week.

Anushay Hossain: The ugly truth behind Saudi Arabia's love for Melania Trump

May 23

Anushay Hossain

Donald Trump's first major trip overseas may be fraught with diplomatic land mines for the President, but the Trump administration can at least comfort itself with the clear hit that Melania Trump has been with the Saudi press.

The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia -- mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her ""classy and conservative"" fashion choices -- works well in the notoriously anti-woman kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually. Melania walks behind her husband, is quiet and reserved, does not make obvious demands (at least not ones we can hear), and most importantly, she looks beautiful and polished...

In Melania, the Saudi press and the Saudi government found the perfect spokeswoman, who projects a glamorous image that glosses over one of world's most autocratic and oppressive regimes.

The question, he adds, is whether Trump will understand the enormity of what he faces or will instead ""be back to being arrogant and stubborn."" He will have to realize that ""all this trip really did was hit the pause button.""

Douglas Heye: After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go

June 14

Douglas Heye

Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an art form. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy.

On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind ""us versus them"" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks.

Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues.

We know what we will do today. We will pray and we will come together. But what we do tomorrow is even more important.

You can be certain they ended up drenched, exhausted, scraped and bruised -- but not broken. They kept that ship from foundering for 16 brutal hours. And they brought her back into port.

On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting.

To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of its annexation of Crimea.

And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world.

President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia.

We should have had some leverage. So what happened?

Jane Carr: What the white supremacist view of history leaves out

August 18

Jane Greenway Carr

The white supremacists in Charlottesville said they wanted to ""defend history"" by protesting efforts to take down Confederate monuments. They say they feel threatened. They fear the removal of ""white stories"" from our culture.

I used to teach African-American literature and cultural history. I wish I could tell them what real erasure looks like. I'd ask them to think about the memorials that never existed in public spaces in the South -- noting Richmond's past as a slave market, or the communities of free blacks who were terrorized by the installation of these Confederate monuments in the first place. To take down Charlottesville's statue of Robert E. Lee will not change the fact that all Virginia schoolchildren know his name, while the names of those who lived in the lost Charlottesville neighborhood of Vinegar Hill are forgotten.

I keep returning to the question: How can people who claim to love history get the meaning of history so very, very wrong?

Lev Golinkin: Jared and Ivanka are failing a basic moral test

August 19

Lev Golinkin

But the silence emanating from Jared and Ivanka was exponentially more powerful than any I'd heard before. To me, as a Jew, seeing nothing but two tweets from Ivanka brought the kind of pain I'm sure is echoed by African-Americans anytime Ben Carson defends the President, and Asian-Americans in the wake of Elaine Chao's and Nikki Haley's equivocations: condemning hate in general terms while carefully avoiding criticizing the very administration they're part of.

No press conference was forthcoming, no rejection of Donald Trump's words; there was no statement from Jared about the horror his grandparents had survived; nothing from Ivanka, who had spoken about standing up for mothers on the campaign trail, about defending today's Jewish children -- her children; indeed all children -- from intimidation and violence. There was nothing, but the sound of steady clicking on Ivanka's electronic device as she wrote two tweets.

It was like listening to the fabric of Judaism tear at itself.

Fifty-four years later, King's legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo in large swaths of the American public. King's words remain a singular anchor for all those who believe in freedom; by speaking truth to power in a political climate more racially toxic than our own, King did more than dream about racial justice.

He challenged all of us to embrace a vision of a liberated future capable of touching individual hearts and minds as it traversed through the blood and veins of the body politic, on the way to creating a nation as good as the best of its citizens.

Alice Stewart: What Trump got right in Texas

August 30

Alice Stewart

Hurricane Harvey is historic, not just in its size and scope, but in its significance as Donald Trump's first natural disaster test as President. His ""darned if you do, darned if you don't"" decision to visit South Texas on Tuesday, away from the rescue efforts, was the right call. Trump is demonstrating he has the compassion and commitment to meet the needs of victims of the deadly storm.

Critics blasted Trump for not meeting with victims directly to offer his personal condolences. Look, there's plenty of time for the powerful photos showing comfort, but now is the time for action -- not optics. These people are in the rescue and recovery mode, which can only be hampered by the distraction of a presidential visit. They need homes, not hugs; they need structure, not selfies, and they need funds, not a presidential flyover.

Unfortunately, every president has been forced to lead this country through natural or man-made disasters and faced the challenges of serving as consoler in chief: President Barack Obama had the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings; President George W. Bush had 9/11; President Bill Clinton met the challenge after the Oklahoma City bombing. All rose to the occasion.

Likewise, Trump is stepping up to the challenge, reassuring storm victims that resources are on the way.

LaQuishe Wright: Harvey survivor: The loss is hitting me in waves

LaQuishe Wright

I woke up Friday morning and looked outside at a deceptively beautiful day. Beautiful because my two sons, Bry and Ryan, two dogs and I are safe and dry and the sun is shining again after days of endless rain. Deceptive because our entire life as we know it is submerged in 4 feet of water less than 20 minutes away.

To experience devastation like that brought by Hurricane Harvey feels very different from what you've probably seen on television. I was lucky enough to make it out of my house in Katy with my kids, my dogs, our cars and at least some of our belongings and memories. My neighbors' harrowing evacuations make me feel even luckier to have made it out safely, but I can't help but be concerned about what comes next for us.

Brooke Baldwin: Speaking like this to women in 2017? No way

The newsroom around me fell silent. I was staring into the camera trying to make sense of what was unfolding on live television. I even caught my cameraman Jay's eyes in disbelief. I thought again: ""It is 2017, and this grown man is on my show talking with me -- a female host -- about boobs. Is this seriously happening?""

And then I did something I've done only a handful of times in my career. I told the control room to kill his mic and said ""bye."" I invite a variety of people on my show with wide-ranging opinions -- sometimes even my jaw hits the floor, too -- but I let them speak. Whether it's left, right or center -- I want to expose my viewers to other perspectives. Agree with them or not, the nation needs to listen.

Eleanor McManus, Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin

October 26

Eleanor McManus

Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me -- perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion.

I don't quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me...

I'm telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I'm hoping women today will finally speak out in real time -- when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women.

Marvin Washington: Kneeling isn't about patriotism -- it's a distress signal

October 14

Marvin Washington

I spent 10 years playing in the NFL, won a Super Bowl and have been blessed beyond imagination -- in no small part because of the best fans in professional sports -- fans of multiple races, genders, religions and political persuasions.

I'm not confused about the role the fans played in my success and neither are the current players in the league. I understand that many NFL fans on both sides feel strongly about the National Anthem protests and the issues of race that underlie them -- so do I and so do the current players. I am an African-American who grew up in the 1960s and the vitriol that surged two Fridays ago, stoked by a speech delivered in Alabama no less, is eerily reminiscent for me of that dark time in our history.

Some players had been engaging in periodic protest long before President Donald Trump's fateful rally, but it's also fair to say this wasn't top of mind for most people before that rally. Trump suggested (mostly white) owners should fire any of the (mostly black) players on their teams who engaged in protest during the National Anthem, and he called them a profane name.

The protests, begun by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and now being carried on by current players, are not about patriotism -- they are about systemic racial inequality in the criminal justice system. They are about how communities of color are policed -- problems that experts on both sides agree on.

Nicole Stamp: What decent men can do in response to #MeToo

October 21

Nicole Stamp

8. Don't use gendered or misogynist insults. Words like bitch, cunt, or slut only target women. Sissy, fairy and cuck demean feminine traits as lesser, weak and undesirable in men. Avoid those words. If you must insult someone, focus on their actions, not their body or their gender.

9. Free kids from rigid gender roles. For boys and young men, you can role-model that activities and traits traditionally coded as ""feminine"" are valuable. Challenge dismissive ideas around what counts as ""girl stuff."" Delight in stories with strong female characters. Give a toddler boy a baby doll and praise his gentleness. Race trucks with a little girl. Give kids the tools and confidence to challenge and defy gender stereotypes.

10. Don't focus on little girls' looks. Many people's first interaction with a young girl is to compliment her cuteness, prettiness or clothing. But this tells her -- and any boys nearby -- that beauty is her most interesting trait. Instead, ask little girls engaging, gender-neutral questions, like ""What kind of toy is that? What subjects do you like in school? What's your favorite animal? Hey, what are you reading?"" There are so many things to talk about.

The last few days the news has been dominated by a controversy over Trump's call to Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow. She is just 24 years old and pregnant with her third child, mourning her husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in an ISIS ambush in Niger. ...

Moments of dignity and solemnity have been interrupted over and over by politics and vitriol and today, it seems, is no different.

I turn the television off and retweet the President's tweet, commenting, ""As I'm watching 'Taking Chance' this tweet alerts on my phone. And that about sums up this week for me.""

A few minutes later a man tweets at me: ""It's telling that you are only now watching this. Been out for years. More evidence U and other media R in a bubble & don't know real people.""

I just can't let it go.

""My husband is on his sixth deployment right now. You don't know anything about me,"" I reply.

Don Lemon: Open letter to Trump: Please stop!

October 26

Don Lemon

Mr. Trump, please stop it. Please stop!

Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way.

Listen to what Myeshia Johnson said this morning in an interview on ABC.

""The President said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways and I was -- it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband's name. The only way he remembered my husband's name because he told me he had my husband's report in front of him and that's when he actually said La David.""

I know you have children -- and two daughters.

Can you imagine Ivanka or Tiffany in Myeshia's shoes?

Mel Robbins: Why Americans don't give a damn about mass shootings

November 6

Mel Robbins

One month ago, the worst mass shooting in US history took place at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 people injured. Bill O'Reilly boiled the massacre down to six words: ""This is the price of freedom.""

I hate to say it, but he is right. Sunday, just 34 days after Vegas, 26 people were gunned down and about 20 others were wounded during a church service in Texas. And here's what is really sick -- we won't be surprised when there's another mass shooting next month. Maybe it'll be your church, your mall, your concert or your movie theater. That's the price of freedom.

In America, we are free to stockpile weapons. We are free to order ammo online. We are free to outfit our guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did. This is the price we pay for freedom, alright. The freedom to not give a damn.

Jessica Barth: We could have made Weinstein powerless

November 9

Jessica Barth

It has taken me a few days to process the sudden explosion of allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault made against Harvey Weinstein. Each woman who steps forward leaves me with a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and pride when I see women joining together to share their stories. On the other, I experience a sense of horror over the staggering number of accusers. Women stripped of their power, silenced and shamed.

I was one of them and recounted my own experience publicly last week.

In my own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, I have been made to feel as if I had to compromise my own convictions for the advancement of my career. I was made to believe that my talent and experience should take a back seat to my physical appearance. I was manipulated into believing I had ""asked for it."" And I was made to feel that if I spoke out or fought back, the repercussions would make me regret it.

Ann Moses: I watched fame take its toll on young David Cassidy

November 22

Ann Moses

When he got the ""Partridge"" gig, David was barely 20, and had very little life experience. He also had little or no support system when he became an overnight sensation. I watched it all happen, and later saw it all unravel, as I spent several days a week on the Partridge set, covering David and his co-stars, real-life stepmom Shirley Jones and Susan Dey.

At first, David was giddy to be appearing on a prime-time television series. He was cheerful and cooperative, which made my job easier as I worked every angle to come up with stories about this shiny-haired young man. ...

A few months later, the nice young man who'd kissed my mom on the cheek in thanks for looking after his puppies was pretty much gone. Whenever I appeared on set, David began to disappear between scenes -- during the times he had once joined me for interviews. I couldn't write about David's favorite snack food (dry-roasted peanuts) or his favorite color (""It depends on my mood"") or how he felt about his neat new sports car if he was hiding from me all the time.

David Gergen: Trump's foolish war with the press

November 27

David Gergen

In other words, we are witness to a war between Trump and the press, playing out every day in newspapers and television. Each morning brings a new revelation; each evening touches off a shouting match. It is difficult to remember any press secretary since Nixon's Ron Ziegler who has faced so much suspicion from the Fourth Estate.

Yet what is equally surprising is how oblivious this White House is to what has gone wrong and how to fix it. His team is as disdainful of history as it is of time-honored traditions about press-government relations. Either they suffer from massive incompetence or extraordinary arrogance.

History has been quite clear: The presidents who have built the best relationships with the press are those who respect its place in American life, have enjoyed a give and take with reporters and care about the truth. From Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Jack Kennedy to Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, press coverage has been much more favorable because those leaders in the Oval Office were not only good copy but men of character in their public lives.

Mark Bauerlein: Why Trump is still winning

December 5

Mark Bauerlein

This is the real battle going on in D.C. today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. ...

And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump's way.

This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don't mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality and victimhood.

Arianne Zucker, I have no fear, so 'Access Hollywood' tape will never define me

December 6

Arianne Zucker

Now that the ""Access Hollywood"" tape is back in the news after reports that Donald Trump questions its authenticity, I am puzzled for this reason: Just from experience, anyone who has ever been on television before, with a microphone pinned to them, should always assume that someone is listening. And when you get caught speaking poorly about someone, at least own up to it.

People ask me whether I need or want an individual apology from either now-President Trump or Billy Bush. Well, apologizing to me would be the appropriate thing to do. Am I losing sleep over it waiting for one? Absolutely not.

I refuse to let a situation such as this one take away my emotional power. You are who you allow yourself to be and I did not and will not let this event or any of its aftermath affect who I am as a woman, mother, daughter, friend and partner to a great man.",human
Saudi Arabia detains senior members of its royal family,"(CNN) Two senior Saudi royals are among several members of the royal family arrested on Friday, two sources with knowledge of the arrests have said, confirming an apparent bid to consolidate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's power.

The brother of Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud and a former crown prince were among those detained, one Saudi source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, said Sunday.

He told CNN that several senior royals were detained in the capital Riyadh on Friday, including Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al Saud, a brother of Saudi King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz al Saud, the king's nephew who is known as MBN.

Prince Ahmed was arrested along with a security detail, the source said. The prince had been on vacation in Morocco, and was arrested two days after returning to the kingdom.

The newly arrested royals have been taken to the same detention facility as the former King's son Turki bin Abdullah, the source added.

Tourists being kept under coronavirus quarantine at luxury Maldives resort,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ While there's no doubt that having your vacation interrupted by a fast-spreading virus that's infected more than 108,000 globally and killed over 3,800 is a major inconvenience, there are surely worse places to be confined than a luxury Maldives resort.

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

The coronavirus outbreak has brought about misery for travelers across the world, leaving thousands stranded on cruise ships or placed in designated quarantine facilities, as governments and local authorities desperately attempt to control the spread of the virus.",human
My mother was raped in a nursing home at 88,"Bobbi Young holds a photo of her mother, Marilyn Young, the day after she passed away at home in Carmel Valley, California.

(CNN) I scanned my mother's bed, pulled back the rumpled sheets and uncovered her shivering naked body. I stared at her bruised inner thighs, her sheets wet with urine and blood, her catheter pulled completely out of her. I covered her with a blanket and held her close as she pleaded, ""Get me out of here.""

I kissed her forehead, our tears mixing, and promised no one was going to stop me. She would not spend another night in this nursing home.

I pushed the call button. No response. I followed the cord to the wall and found it disconnected. My heart racing, I tracked down an aide and demanded that a nurse come to my mother's room immediately. At 88, she was examined with nonchalance and covered back up.

I called the manager to her room and told her I was taking Mom home.

The nursing staff gathered in force, attempting to convince me that her release was a long process, that my mother could still benefit from their help. Her stay in the nursing home had been a temporary transition needed after being hospitalized with a stroke.

But I knew my mother had been harmed. I feared the worse. And I feared for her life if she stayed there.

I called her doctor to sign a release form, and I phoned a service for private medical transport. I also called my husband and said, ""I need to bring Mom home with us today. Go get Daddy.""

At the front door of the nursing home, the management staff lined up to wish us well. They invited us to come back and visit.

""Thank you,"" I told them, ""but we will never drive by this road again.""

When we arrived home, the driver unloaded my bundled mother and the rain momentarily stopped. I looked up and saw my father, his hand pressed to the window, tears in his eyes and mouthing the words ""Mama ... Mama's home."" Married 69 years, my parents experienced every second apart as an eternity.

Once settled in their own bed, Daddy curled up next to Mother, held her hand, prayed with her, assured her she was OK now, home safe. She was still recovering from her stroke, and even though my father sensed some harm had come to her, he didn't ask. He didn't want to stress her more. He never left her side.

Medical equipment, photos of happier times and leftover Christmas decorations fill Marilyn Young's bedroom.

Over the weeks that followed, my mother complained of pain in her groin area. Doctors increased the doses of pain medication, but she still awoke in anguish, day after day. I finally had to examine her -- and my heart sank.

I knew she needed to be seen by her gynecologist as soon as possible.

A nurse practitioner examined my mother and ran tests to confirm her suspicions: a sexually transmitted disease. Had my mother shown these symptoms before, she asked. The answer was no. Had my mother had any sexual partners besides my father in her lifetime? The answer was no.

When I told her about what had happened in the nursing home, the nurse said my father would need to be tested for the disease. My mother was visibly shaken. I asked the nurse, if my father was negative, what would be the next step? She said, you need to call the California Department of Public Health and file a report.

We drove home silently. My mind struggled with how much my mother had been through; now we were minutes away from devastating my father. I asked if she wanted my help in telling Daddy. The answer was yes.

As I spoke, Daddy didn't hesitate to agree to be tested. Then he asked what all of this meant. What would proving he was negative for the disease mean?

Mama, her voice choked with sadness, replied: ""I was raped.""

My father held my mother, crying, shaking his head in disbelief and apologizing for not being able to keep her safe.

I grew up believing my parents were strong and took comfort trusting I would always be safe. They both worked two or three jobs throughout my childhood to buy me and my siblings encyclopedias to enhance our knowledge of the world long before Google existed.

Witnessing this wound inflicted on my parents cut deeply to the core of my own foundation. The hospital had recommended the nursing home as a transitional step; her own internist was the director of the facility: What could possibly go wrong?

There were no warning flags. We failed to protect her against something we could not even imagine existed. A distress signal is only as good as the person who sees it. When I saw it, I took action. But it was too late.

For months, my parents comforted each other, not wanting to be even a foot apart. Their love never wavered; it only deepened. I would walk past their bedroom and see them snuggled tightly together, whispering. My father later told me they were praying and planning to renew their wedding vows on their 70th anniversary.

Beyond the harm the perpetrator had inflicted on my mother, he took a toll on my father's remaining strength and stole some of the precious time my parents had left. Still, together they decided to fight for reform, which my husband and I fully supported. We filed a civil lawsuit against the facility, arguing that more should have been done to protect my mother. She was brave enough to appear at the center of a public service video created by a nonprofit calling for nursing home reform.

After taking her mother into her own home, Bobbi Young cared for her until Marilyn passed away in January.

Two months before my father passed away at 95, he told my mother his time was near and asked my husband and I to help them renew their vows early. They exchanged their promises tearfully and glowed with renewed divinity. He did not live long enough to see my mother receive a settlement in her case against the nursing home.

On the day my father died, my husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. His painful journey ended 17 months later. But our commitment to choose love and joy enabled Mother and I to embrace our faith and carry on. I promised my husband I would not be sad or bitter. I had promised my father I would care for Mama and keep her safe.

I feared that I would not be able to fulfill those promises.

But there are moments in life that transcend fear. They mend twisted hearts. This became one of those moments.

After my husband's funeral, all of my mother's nurturing traits intensified. I had promised to care for her, and now she was providing me with what felt like a second childhood. She took the reins, suggesting remedies such as extra locks on doors and an alarm system to quiet our fears. She reminded me of recipes to help stretch our dollars to survive -- such as making ""imagination cookies."" When I looked sad, she would talk about funny things my husband did to make her laugh. We prayed together, planned our spring garden, went for drives on hot days with the windows down, hair blowing in the wind, laughing with memories.

I promised my mother I would honor her vow to carry on her courageous battle for justice all the days of my life by telling her story. While her perpetrator will likely never be found, it was one of her last wishes for people to understand that no one is too old to become a victim of rape.

My mother died in January. She was 94. As I walk around my home now, I look at the empty rocking chair in which she soothed her children. I can feel her brushing my long hair. The seedlings she planted in eggshells on Christmas Day are bursting toward spring. I can hear her laughter and her reminder to me: ""The gifts God gave you, he did not give to another; respect them and share them wisely. ...""

Who was this woman in my life? Why was she made to suffer so?

An answer fills my sorrowful heart:

Suffering can carve two types of people, monsters and angels. I am fortunate to have been raised by angels. And I pray to one day be worthy of that divine fabric that still holds me tightly together -- love.

NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners,"New York (CNN Business) The NBA's announcement it was suspending its season after a player preliminarily tested positive for coronavirus sent shockwaves throughout the world of sports and media.

The league decision Wednesday to suspend games until further notice is a major blow to its television partners, Disney's ABC and ESPN and AT&T's TNT. The NBA is not just one of the most popular sports leagues on the planet, it's also a major driver of advertising revenue for these networks.

Despite its sluggish numbers this season, the NBA still brings in viewers at a time when more and more people are watching streaming services likein lieu of traditional TV. This is whyand WarnerMedia's Turner renewed a TV rights deal in 2014 that reportedly cost $24 billion . (WarnerMedia is also the parent of CNN.)

""From a media business point of view, this suspension means everything,"" Lee Igel, a clinical associate professor at the NYU Tisch Institute for Global Sport, told CNN Business.

Igel added that this situation is unique because it impacts the network's ratings in two ways: primarily broadcasting the games and also broadcasting the NBA as a ""media product,"" or something that studio shows like ""Inside the NBA"" and ""SportsCenter"" can talk endlessly about.

""This is different than when games aren't being played in the offseason and people can bat around which free agents might go where,"" he said. ""There's a lot less to talk about.""

Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive, said it's ""a serious impairment for this quarter and likely the next.""

""There's many questions that have yet to be answered,"" Crakes told CNN Business. ""What happens to the advertising revenue that's already been booked? Do the networks have to give that money back or is there a way to make this work out over the long run? And most importantly will the NBA find a way to continue its season in some way?""

Crakes pointed out that the NBA Playoffs, which were set to start in April, are the crown jewel of the season for the league and its TV partners, and if they can still take place it could help make up for the losses from the suspended season.

""If the playoffs air, networks could use some of their advertising inventory they hold back to make good on the missing games from the season,"" Crakes said. ""It makes things better, it helps, but it probably won't make up for what happened.""

The losses of advertising revenue from the suspension could be ""in the range of $75 million to $100 million"" across the games on ABC, ESPN and Turner, Crakes said.

Turner Sports said in a statement Wednesday it has ""a long-standing relationship with the NBA and we're supportive of the actions being taken to help protect the health and well-being of everyone involved. We'll partner closely with league officials to evaluate and determine next steps at the appropriate time.""

As for ABC and ESPN, the networks called it an unprecedented situation.

""We have great relationships with our league partners and are confident we can address all issues constructively going forward,"" the networks said in a statement. ""Our immediate focus is on everyone's safety and well-being.""

But the timing of the suspension couldn't be worse for the league's TV partners.

""More people are going to be working from home and nesting at home from a safety standpoint, avoiding other people,"" Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed, told CNN Business. ""So people are going to be looking for forms of in home entertainment.""

have put their seasons on hold. The NBA isn't the only major sport pausing its season. The NHL and Major League Soccer have put their seasons on hold.

""TV would have potentially been one of the winners, but without sports my guess is now the streaming platforms, video games and YouTube will take advantage,"" Greenfield added.",human
Meet the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year,"(CNN) It's something that girls and young women in western countries can't imagine: missing school, even dropping out, because of their periods. Yet as many as half the girls in rural parts of Ethiopia miss school for reasons related to their periods -- and that can have a devastating effect on their education and the rest of their lives.

Freweini Mebrahtu has dedicated her life to keeping girls in school by designing a reusable menstrual pad and trying to end the cultural stigma around the issue -- and because of her work, she has been named the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year

""I don't even know what to say,"" Mebrahtu said when receiving the award. ""I am so humbled and grateful for CNN ... this is for all the girls and women everywhere. Dignity for all.""

Online voters selected Mebrahtu as the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year award from among the Top 10 CNN Heroes finalists

Mebrahtu -- who is from Ethiopia and studied chemical engineering in the US -- designed and patented a reusable menstrual pad in 2005. She and her team produce 750,000 reusable pads a year at her factory in Ethiopia. Nearly 800,000 girls and women have benefited from her work.

Nigeria says it is ready and more than capable of dealing with coronavirus,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) The head of Nigeria's National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says the country is more than capable of dealing with coronavirus as Africa's most populous nation records its first case.

""Nigeria is ready,"" Chikwe Ihekweazu said. ""We successfully managed Ebola and we manage outbreaks all the time and are currently managing Lassa fever. We have a strong team that is used to doing this.""

An Italian citizen who traveled to Lagos, Nigeria's economic nerve center, became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa, the country's Health Ministry reported earlier.

Ihekweazu told CNN the Italian patient who arrived in the country with the virus is currently stable and ""has mild to moderate symptoms.""

""We are very hopeful for his full recovery,"" said Ihekweazu, an epidemiologist who was appointed CEO of the NCDC in 2016 and has been credited with transforming the organization.

According to Ihekweazu, the man was screened on arrival at the airport, however, he presented no symptoms at the time, which is why the temperature scanners at the airport did not detect he was ill.

""Screening is not a fool proof method as the virus has an incubation period of four to five days,"" he added.

Earlier this week, Algeria confirmed the first case on the continent, another Italian passenger who entered the country on February 17. The patient was placed in quarantine, and under close supervision, according to health authorities in Algeria.

'Astute physicians'

Nigerian officials say the patient who works in Nigeria arrived in Lagos on February 25 and became ill the next day but quick thinking physicians who examined him contacted the NCDC after asking him about his travel history.

""He had astute physicians,"" Ihekweazu said. ""The doctor got in touch with us when he found out he had just come from Milan, we collected a sample, tested it and isolated him in a facility in Lagos that manages infectious diseases.""

Ihekweazu points to the speed with which Nigeria identified and confined the patient as a sign the country is prepared to deal with the outbreak.

""The system worked. We identified this case, diagnosed and isolated within 48 hours of it entering the country. In other countries like Iran and Italy for instance, by the time the first case had been confined, there was widespread contact.""

No water access

Frequent handwashing with soap and water is one of the key ways of ensuring infectious diseases such as coronavirus do not spread.

However, one in six healthcare facilities globally do not have both soap and water available for doctors, nurses and patients to wash their hands, says Tim Wainwright, Chief Executive, WaterAid UK.

Figures from WHO shows that only 42 percent of Nigerians have access to water, soap and washing facilities on their premises, while 25 percent have no access to water at all.

Nigeria has around 200 million citizens so there are significant concerns about the impact of coronavirus spreading widely.

The World Health Organization recently said that an outbreak of coronavirus in Africa would hit the continent harder than China.

The novel coronavirus has killed at least 2,800 people worldwide , the vast majority in mainland China.

There have been more than 83,000 global cases, with infections in every continent except Antarctica.

Many of the countries in Africa are already dealing with severe health crises with limited resources, such as Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

A race against time

Ihekweazu said the government is now racing against time to identify all the passengers on the plane and all the people who may have come in contact with the man who was working as a consultant in Ogun State, around 100 km outside of Lagos.

""The contact tracing is happening now and we are looking in detail at who he might have come in contact with. The easier part is identifying people on the flight as we have the manifest, but the difficult part is the people he may have come in contact with. We are asking them to

Despite Nigeria's preparedness, Ihekweazu said resources are stretched and the unknown nature of the coronavirus means that there are no guarantees.

""This is a new virus. As much as we can do our best, there are no guarantees of success. Resources will always be a challenge for us. In the short term, we have what we need to mount a moderate response but the more these cases happen, the more stretched we will become.""

The health ministry urged citizens not to panic and to avoid spreading misinformation.

""Citizens must not abuse social media and indulge in spreading misinformation that causes fear and panic,"" it said.",human
Donald Trump brings out the worst in people,"Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) It's too bad Superman is not running for president of the United States; this would have been his year. Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned -- and yearning for a savior.

This happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn't seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.

No, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.

Who would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist -- throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!

Looking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking ""them"" -- whoever ""they"" happen to be at the moment -- vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini , the theatrical Italian ""Duce,"" the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.

Is Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn't propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He's a Trumpist. And we're only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.

Fascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump's rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?

Cult of personality

One distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner's main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That's not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There's very little in the way of substance. There's just a lot of Trump.

And to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution , and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations : armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)

Charisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.

Validating prejudices

Trump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between ""us"" and ""them.""

We don't know what kind of a president he would be. It's hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there's no telling. He has already defied all predictions.

In a new turn of events since Thursday's GOP debate, Trump's opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump's savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It's good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it's unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it's a sad sight.

Sanders found a scapegoat

Then there's the other end of the political spectrum: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the longtime Independent socialist politician now running as a Democrat.

Sanders is no 1930s Marxist. He is not advocating the takeover by the state of the means of production and the abolition of private property. But in the spirit of his socialist convictions, he too has found a scapegoat for all that ails America. Sanders would squeeze the rich, for whom he does not hide his contempt. In the manner of a demagogue, he declared , ""Fraud is the business model of Wall Street.""

Sanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system. But his overall approach, if it could ever be implemented, has the makings of an economic disaster . We know that because it was already tried.

Hillary Clinton's overwhelming victory in South Carolina may mark the beginning of the end for the Sanders movement, perhaps a sign that voters know Sanders' idealistic offerings, no matter how appealing, are disconnected from what is possible.

His plans would create deficits so large that there are not enough zeroes in calculator displays to hold them. His plans would produce deficits of between $18 trillion to $30 trillion (with a T) from new spending. You can squeeze the Wall Street billionaires as hard as you want. Even they don't have that much money. And while you're at it, see what happens to the economy if you impose the taxes required to even start those programs.

Sanders running honorable but mistaken campaign

Both Trump and Sanders are advocating granting much greater powers to the government. To be sure, Sanders appears to be aiming to force discussion of important issues in the campaign, and, unlike Trump, has run an honorable, throughtful and respectful campaign.

Trump would apparently expand government to secure the country from enemies and from immigrants. Sanders would do it to pay for social plans. Both positions carry a faint whiff of Nirvana, telling voters who feel unsettled -- by growing inequality, expensive unwon wars, and a sense that America is starting to fall behind -- that they have an answer to repair the country, to make them feel safe.

Again, this is not Europe in the 1930s, but the European experience carries a warning: Beware of politicians offering easy fixes. Rousing speeches are no guarantee of a better future.",human
Our connected world made coronavirus spread. It may also be what saves us from it,"(CNN) When the mixed signals and blundering of President Donald Trump's Wednesday night Oval Office speech die down, it's possible that the two words ""foreign virus,"" are the ones that will endure.

They echo Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- at his least diplomatic -- who dubbed the outbreak that has now killed over 4,000 people in dozens of countries the ""Wuhan virus.""

There's no comfort in the irony that an administration which tried initially to dismiss COVID-19 as something happening elsewhere that wasn't a problem, are -- now it is upon them -- blaming people elsewhere for giving them the problem.

This insular populism seems to have fueled President Trump's European flight ban . It bizarrely excluded the UK and gladly ignored the possibility people might use Britain as a transfer hub from infected countries, on to the US.

It was a Stephen Miller response to an Anthony Fauci question. Trump was clear only in how decisive he wanted to appear. The technicalities were a sideshow, but if you are facing a pandemic, they should be the main dish.

The address was a bid to deflect blame by an administration confused about everything in its response, bar its own infallibility. When they came, the clarifications were perhaps longer than the original statement -- mentioning that trade was not included, neither were Americans themselves, or US residents, or their immediate family.

Yet the damage was done: confusion at airports, in global markets, and across capitals. US partners awoke to yet another example of the Trump administration seeing alliances as an afterthought. Suddenly Europe was America's scapegoat, while China was busy sending medical aid to Italy.

Populist responses can't solve this, the first universal crisis of the globalized world.

Everyone, everywhere will be, or has been, impacted by this. Neither the unified policies adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, nor the counterterror surveillance and military might of post 9/11 can stop the transfer of a virus so infective that science appears to struggle to gauge just yet how infective it is. We don't know how long it will last, or how many people it will kill and so that uncertainty is tearing up the algorithms that keep the global economy afloat.

Slowly getting sick is a population never larger, never better connected, living on a planet that never felt smaller. It is more than grossly unfortunate that its key superpower has reached for the tool most readily at hand to deal with this crisis, populism.

Those who use this moment to say it is proof there are too many of ""them, here,"" are perhaps at the same time proving an uncomfortable point: the way the world is connected now cannot easily be undone. Trump needs the supply chain into America to continue pumping the means for tax revenue and wealth, he just thinks he can switch off some of the people.

Those, including the US' national security advisor, who says China started it and covered it up, also have to confront the fact it was Europe, the US and even Iran's dependence on Chinese wealth -- tourists, students or engineers -- that spread it. We need each other's money.

Amid the chaos, there may be a moment for hope and education. Every nation is likely -- at this point, as far as we can tell -- dealing with the same strain of the virus. China's experience can tell us how bad it can get even when you are able to forcibly quarantine people; South Korea's what happens when a state marshals incredible transparency and testing; Italy when widespread and voluntary paralysis besets an entire nation; the United Kingdom what happens when you try to delay the spread. We can all teach the other lessons learned. For perhaps the first time since there have been billions of us, we all have a singular goal to share.

COVID-19 is also an existential challenge to the post-truth era. This illness infects quickly regardless of demographics, belief, wealth or skin color.

The facts about its spread, vaccine and mortality rate can't be lied away. It was science -- advances in communication, travel and technology -- that made the world so small that coronavirus could travel so fast. It will be the same science that defeats it and makes that smallness feel safe again.

Globalization left many behind, and made some unconscionably wealthy, others disgracefully poor. It also made humans, on average, richer, healthier and more peaceful than any time in our collective history.

Soon the blame game for transmission may get under way in earnest. The same populists who thought the UK being an island meant it was unlikely to be much of a COVID-19 threat to America, will continue to suggest the virus means globalization's free movements must end.

But keep one eye on the role shared experience and knowledge plays in bringing this pandemic to an end. On how Hong Kong teaches Italy. On how China sends help to Iran. On how the Koreas help each other.

Our interlaced world may have helped this spread. But that connection will likely bring it to an end. And the isolation we all feel in the gap in-between will make us appreciate for once how close we have all been.",human

Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"Written by Jorge Grimberg, CNN

In February, the Brazilian fashion industry made global headlines. Donata Meirelles , then fashion director at Vogue Brazil, was celebrating her 50th birthday in the predominantly black city of Salvador, Bahia. During the celebration, journalist Fabio Bernardo snapped a photo of Meirelles, who is white, sitting in a traditional throne-like chair flanked by two baianas (Afro-Brazilian women wearing white lace gowns and headpieces), which he then shared on Instagram.

To many who saw the post (which has since been deleted), the scene evoked colonial Brazil, when white elites ruled over black slaves.

""What happened there is what happens in this country built on racism, bodies, sweat, blood and black tears,"" Afro-Brazilian actress and activist Tais Araujo, Vogue Brazil's November 2018 cover star, posted to her Instagram account in the days following the event. ""This suffering is so naturalized that it is difficult for people who do not identify with the girls standing by the chair to feel what the black population feels. Everything becomes natural.""

While the party was not an official Vogue event, the backlash was enough to warrant Meirelles' resignation from the title just a few days after the event, and a public apology from the magazine, who wrote on Instagram that they hoped the discussions sparked by the incident had ""served as a learning opportunity."" (Both Meirelles and Vogue Brazil declined to be interviewed for this story.)

And it has: On social media and beyond, the industry and the public have been having long overdue conversations about race and representation in Brazil's fashion community.

According to a Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics study released in 2016, 54% of Brazilians identify as black or multiracial. And yet black people have been all but erased from the mainstream fashion industry -- in front of the camera, on the catwalk and behind the scenes.

Historically, model diversity at SÃÂ£o Paulo Fashion Week has been so low that in 2009, following intense pressure from anti-racism activists and state prosecutors, the organizing body mandated that 10% of models in each show must be black.

At last edition of SÃÂ£o Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), which took place in April month, black models were still in the minority, and for the last three seasons, only one black designer -- Luiz Claudio of Apartamento 03 -- has participated. (SPFW CEO Paulo Borges told CNN that organizers are aware of the disparity and are discussing ways to bring in new players.)

Why model Leomie Anderson is fighting for change

""In a country where most of the population is black, it's troubling to think that fashion, one of the most important vehicles of cultural and social expression, excludes such large numbers of creators and consumers,"" Afro-Brazilian artist and fashion designer Carol Barreto, who teaches gender studies at the Federal University of Bahia, said in an email.

""The entertainment world is highly susceptible to reproducing stereotypes, so it's important to study the limits and latitudes imposed when dealing with questions of race,"" she continued, because the propagation of negative images can contribute to perceptions of Black people as inferior.

Juliano Corbetta, founder and editor-in-chief of the online menswear publication Made in Brazil, has witnessed how racial inequality in Brazil can affect a magazine financially.

In early 2018, Corbetta set out to publish an issue that was would feature predominantly black talent (including producers, photographers and models) to inspire ""16-year-old kids dreaming of breaking into a fashion career."" Though he had no trouble finding talent to fill the pages, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to secure the advertisements needed to fund the issue.

""Reality hit. For the first time in nine years in publishing, everyone declined. No one wanted to include this (magazine) in their 2019 plans,"" Corbetta said. Many brands, he claims, told him an all-black issue wouldn't resonate with their audience.

He connects the issue to the fact that, in Brazil, discussing race and racism is still widely taboo. ""We never talk about apartheid. We didn't have a Martin Luther King. We didn't have a Rosa Parks. We didn't have an actual militant anti-racism movement. We have never talked about prejudice, even though it exists, so brands don't talk about it either.""

In this landscape, Brazil's black creatives -- like many marginalized groups around the world -- are increasingly turning to the internet and social media to create spaces for themselves in response to a lack of mainstream opportunity.

This was the route taken by Luiza Brasil, a Rio de Janeiro-based influencer and columnist for the Brazilian edition of Glamour. In 2015, she created Mequetrefismos, an online fashion, beauty and lifestyle publication, to promote the work of black people working within those fields; and, as a curator for the Casa Ipanema lifestyle boutique in Rio, has brought brands runs by black women to the forefront.

""We see more black people featured on magazine covers and in advertisements for luxury stores, but who are the people behind these campaigns? (The fact that they are usually white) says a lot about the lack of black people in organizations and leadership roles,"" Brasil said in a WhatsApp message. ""The black population is in the majority -- at 54% -- but our narratives have always been constructed by white people.""

""I think the Afro-Brazilian (empowerment) movement has always existed, but it's always been invisible. With the help of the internet, the Afro-Brazilian movement has gained momentum.""

Kevin David, a 25-year-old based in SÃÂ£o Paulo, agrees. As executive creative director of MOOC , a Black-run creative collective, he's used the power of social media to land youth-oriented collaborative campaigns with the likes of Levi's, Converse, GQ Brazil and Schutz.

""There are fewer opportunities (for black creatives), but we are taking over. We have entered the market ... Weren't happy with the way the market was treating us,"" David said. ""We didn't want anyone else to tell our story. We wanted to take action and show that we believe representation means at this moment in Brazil.""

Brasil believes that the ongoing empowerment black creatives in the digital sphere will help challenge existing narratives and give Brazil more complex, diverse representations of black identity -- within Afro-Brazilian communities and in the mainstream.

""We no longer only represent an image of the ghetto, of blacks speaking only to blacks, but an important snapshot of society and our media in general"", she said.

"Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts","I started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. Ã¢ÂÂWe do not define the different generations,Ã¢ÂÂ she told me. Ã¢ÂÂThe only generation we do define is Baby Boomers, and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964.Ã¢ÂÂ

Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. Ã¢ÂÂI think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media,Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete said, Ã¢ÂÂand the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation.Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It Ã¢ÂÂhad specific characteristics,Ã¢ÂÂ and occurred within an observable time frame. World War II ended. You had the postwar rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: Ã¢ÂÂHistory isnÃ¢ÂÂt always so punctuated.Ã¢ÂÂ

I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? DoesnÃ¢ÂÂt their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? Ã¢ÂÂI actually havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously,Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete said. The things that have shaped MillennialsÃ¢ÂÂthe rise of technology and social networks, for exampleÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂaffect peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives differently.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThe media in particular wants definitions, identities,Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete said. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries Ã¢ÂÂ¦ At the end, I think it gets fuzzy.Ã¢ÂÂ

Well, yeah. We do want definitions. And if the media draws the boundaries, then allow us to do so definitively.

Your official demarcation of generational boundaries

We identified six different generations and labeled their eras.

Greatest Generation. These are the people who fought and died in World War II for our freedom, which we appreciate. But itÃ¢ÂÂs a little over-the-top as far as names go, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it? Tom Brokaw made the name up and of course everyone loved it. What, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to argue with your grandfather that he isnÃ¢ÂÂt in the greatest generation? The generation ended when the war ended.

Baby Boomers. This is the agreed-upon generation that falls within DiPreteÃ¢ÂÂs punctuated time frame. It began when the Greatest Generation got home and started having sex with everyone; it ended when having sex with everyone was made easier with the pill.

Generation X. George Masnick, of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, puts this generation in the time frame of 1965 to 1984, in part because itÃ¢ÂÂs a neat 20-year period. He also calls it the Ã¢ÂÂbaby bust,Ã¢ÂÂ mocking Ã¢ÂÂpundits on Madison Avenue and in the mediaÃ¢ÂÂ who call it Generation X. Ha ha, tough luck.",human

There is cautious optimism in South Sudan that a newly formed unity government can finally bring peace following years of civil war.

What has also got people talking are the prominent roles women have been given, including Angelina Teny, who is now defence minister, the first woman to hold the position.

Ms Teny, who is also married to the former rebel leader and now first Vice-President Riek Machar, is not new to the security role.

While her husband has been under effective house arrest, first in South Africa and then Khartoum, she has been one of the opposition SPLM-IOÃ¢ÂÂs chief negotiators and led the groupÃ¢ÂÂs National Committee for Security and Defence.

She is a straight-talker and quick-thinker who has been one of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs most important politicians.

SheÃ¢ÂÂs previously served as state minister for energy and mining and after independence from Sudan, she led negotiations between the two countries on how to divide lucrative and contested oil assets.

More recently, she spent 17 months in the capital, Juba, after the signing of the recent peace deal working out security arrangements on how rebels and government forces could be merged.

Since her appointment some have questioned her qualifications to be defence minister.

A few weeks ago, I met Ms Teny at a hotel in the centre of Juba where her husband has been living since his return to the country and his appointment to the unity government.

There were hardly any customers there but the lobby and parking space were filled with security officials both in military fatigues and plain clothes.

The compromise the couple and their supporters made by coming back to the capital was to effectively hand over their personal security to their bitter rival, President Salva Kiir.

In 2016, the opposing sides formed a unity government and Mr MacharÃ¢ÂÂs rebel forces accompanied him into the city Ã¢ÂÂ it ended up with clashes between the opposing forces and the two fleeing the country.

Now the stage has been set for a repeat, and many will be watching to see if things work out better this time round.",human
Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos,"Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN

Favored by hardened yakuza gang members and law-abiding body art purists alike, large-scale Japanese tattoos are widely celebrated for their distinctive style, mythological motifs and vibrant coloring.

But while many of the common motifs are steeped in history and folklore, Japan's pictorial tattooing tradition is relatively new. Before the Edo period (c.1615-1868), tattoos were primarily used as crude markers of punishment for petty criminals or of fealty for lovers, or else the domain of the indigenous Ainu tribes of the northern islands.

According to ""Tattoos in Japanese Prints,"" a new publication from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it was only in the 19th century that they were elevated to the level of art.

Author Sarah E. Thompson, curator of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, traces their popularity back to the publication of ""One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin,"" a series of woodblock prints by the artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, between 1827 and 1830.

His prints, adapted from a 14th-century Chinese novel, saw bandit heroes covered with elaborate, full-body tattoos rendered in impressive detail. The common motifs -- dragons and demons, fearsome predators, koi fish and cherry blossoms -- were laden with meaning, and added another layer to the narrative.

Here he's depicted three actors in various roles, their tattoos meant to evoke characters from the books and plays of the day. Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston

""By emphasizing the tattoos sported by some of the heroes, Kuniyoshi's print designs not only exploited the allure of the exotic but also provided a titillating hint of the illicit -- especially if the suggestion that pictorial tattoos in Japan had been outlaws and spread to fashionable urbanites is correct,"" Thompson writes.

The impact of the ""Water Margin"" series and similar works from Kuniyoshi and his contemporaries was immediate and broad-reaching. Men across class lines requested tattoos of scenes from ""Water Margins"" -- and, in some cases, the characters' tattoos. Textile artists started incorporating tattoo-like prints into their designs; kabuki stars painted simple designs onto their skin for performances.

(The tattoos did have their detractors, however. In 1872, as Japan started its push toward Westernization, tattoos were banned by the Japanese government, who considered them uncivilized and old-fashioned. This ban was lifted after the American occupation after WWII.)

""It is uncertain whether Kuniyoshi was responding to a recent craze for extensive pictorial tattoos, or whether -- as suggested by oral tradition among present-day tattoo artists -- it was the prints themselves that inspired the new fashion,"" Thompson writes.

""Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between: large tattoos were already beginning to appear, but it was Kuniyoshi who transformed a temporary fad into a lasting art form.""",human
Satellite images show Iran building burial pits for coronavirus victims,"(CNN) Iran has been rapidly expanding a major cemetery in Qom, the area worst hit by the country's novel coronavirus outbreak, satellite images obtained by CNN reveal.

The country has reported at least 10,075 confirmed coronavirus cases and 429 deaths, the third-highest number of cases after mainland China and Italy.

The satellite images from March 1 and March 8, put out by Maxar Technologies, appear to show an increase in activity inside the Behesht-e Masoumeh cemetery in Qom. The images show what looks like two fresh trenches of graves on March 1, with more excavation after that.

According to Islamic tradition, bodies are supposed to be buried quickly after death. But Behesht-e Masoumeh morgue director Ali Ramezani told Iranian state TV earlier this month that burials were being delayed as testing for the virus takes time. And while corpses are traditionally washed with soap and water before burial in Iran, two medical workers in Qom told CNN that in some cases precautions related to the outbreak are preventing staff from observing traditional Islamic guidelines for burial.

A video from the morgue showed dozens of bodies sheathed in black bags on the floor of an Iranian morgue, while workers in protective suits and masks busily walk among them.

Leeds pupil 'sent home' for selling hand sanitiser,"Image copyright Jenny Tompkins/Facebook Image caption Jenny Tompkins posted a picture of her son arriving home earlier after he was caught selling squirts of hand sanitiser

A teenager was sent home from school after being caught selling shots of hand sanitiser to his fellow pupils at 50p a go, his family claimed.

His mother, Jenny Tompkins, from Leeds, posted a picture of him arriving home earlier after his entrepreneurial exploits at Dixons Unity Academy.

In a post on Facebook, she said it was hard to discipline her son when his ""dad called to say he was a legend"".

The school denied it had excluded any pupils for selling hand sanitiser.

Some respondents to the post, which was shared nearly 130,000 times, praised his efforts.

One said ""can't fault his logic"".

Others reminisced about selling cigarettes for ÃÂ£1 a go.

Someone else said: ""Bet he gets an A in economics.""

His mother, however, said she tried to be serious when the school called, and later when her son arrived home ""with a big grin on his face"".

She said this was made more difficult after she called his father at work, who responded by calling him ""a [expletive] legend"".

Her son plans to use the ÃÂ£9 he made to buy a kebab and a multipack of Doritos, she added.

In a statement, the school said: ""No pupil has ever been excluded for selling hand sanitiser"".

""The student in question was excluded for a separate and unrelated incident in line with academy behaviour policy.""

Earlier it was announced the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day.

Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Written by Aileen Kwun, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNN Stephy Chung, CNN

Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide ""momentum"" for its ""existing diversity and inclusion approach.""

The move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.

About two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to ""create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity."" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.

These announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.

These missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.

Hiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.

Teen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , ""why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?""

Another user wrote: ""white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.""

In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment ""is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.""

The brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.

From the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?

Fashion's new watchdogs

With designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.

Fashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.

Take the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million ""Dieters"") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.

Social media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.

But controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

The industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, ""and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown"" in marketing materials. ""It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.""

Meanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw ""coolie"" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's ""New Look"" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.

Sales of the YSL perfume ""Opium"" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.

""We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,"" Steele said in a phone interview. ""How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.""

While the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.

""The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,"" Steele added. ""Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.""

Why brands miss the mark

Whether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.

This is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.

Here, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as ""creepy"" by social media users.

Fashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.

This raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.

Former Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like ChloÃÂ©, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.

She believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.

""These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.

""With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,"" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. ""Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.""

Tapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the HermÃÂ¨s-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.

More than money

There is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.

The D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.

If more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. ""Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,"" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and ""in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.""

""You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,"" she said. ""You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.""

Steele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.

And the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.

""Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,"" said Steele.

""On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.""

This pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.

""Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.""

Steps toward accountability

Brands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.

In January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.

""The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,"" the briefing stated. ""It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.""

As the report articulated, diversity is ""simply a measure of difference"" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating ""a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole."" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.

The current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.

The industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.

Remedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.

While no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will ""elevate voices of color.""

And when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund ""to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)

Burberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.

But they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.

TV shows to watch if you're in the mood to lean into your worries,"(CNN) This weekend, I cleaned the floors of my home with a diluted bleach solution and developed a protocol for entering my home from the outside world that was inspired by decontamination chambers I've seen in TV shows.

To be clear, you don't have to put these procedures into place due to the coronavirus pandemic. The best defense is actually washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds and not touching your face.

But I am, to be frank, a bit of a germaphobe, who instituted a similarly strict approach to cleanliness after our home got hit particularly hard from the flu this year. (Clearly, we run a party home; over for brunch, sometime!)

I've discovered over time -- and through some serious therapy, in case you're wonder -- that I am someone that prefers to stare my anxieties right in the face. (Note: If you prefer to do the opposite, I made a list for you, too.)

When I was stressed over planning my wedding, I watched hours of wedding-related television , including every episode of ""Four Weddings."" When a bunch of people I knew confronted serious medical issues just weeks apart, I binge watched ""ER.""

As fears over coronavirus have affected daily life, a stare-off with my paranoia has begun. These are some of the shows I've been watching:

""Containment""

'Containment'

This CW limited series about a mysterious outbreak checked all the boxes of both a good pandemic story (graphic depictions of illness) and the things you'd come to the CW for (romances tested by extreme circumstances). The show managed a mildly satisfying conclusion despite the network deciding the story was best, um, contained to one season.

Why watch it? It's a good option if you're tired of watching "" It's a good option if you're tired of watching "" Contagion .""

""Kitchen Nightmares""

Gordon Ramsey hosts 'Kitchen Nightmares'

This show doesn't directly have to do with an outbreak, but let me tell you, dirty commercial kitchens are a pandemic in need of eradicating. Luckily, chef Gordon Ramsey is on the case. If you're trying to inspire yourself to do a good cleaning of your kitchen, there is no better inspiration out there than looking at the horrors contained inside poorly maintained walk-in freezers.

Why watch it? You might be inspired to eat in, limiting your exposure to a number of ailments.

""The Hot Zone""

Dr. Nancy Jaax (Julianna Margulies) works in her pathology lab in an episode of ""The Hot Zone."" (National Geographic/Amanda Matlovich)

Julianna Margulies starred in this 6-episode limited series for National Geographic based on the book of the same name. In the series, an Army scientist (Marguilies) works to contain an Ebola outbreak in the nation's capital. The opening moments, like the book, are graphic and horrifying as a sick airplane passenger sets the scene. It's truly the stuff of nightmares, if you're into that sort of thing.

Why watch it? It's educational. But be warned: you may develop a fear of monkeys.

It's available On Demand.

""Doomsday Preppers""

'Doomsday'

Even those of us who have a well-stocked earthquake kit -- or similar emergency supplies, depending on the threats in the area you live Ã¢ÂÂ will feel ill prepared watching the people featured on this National Geographic series. Over four seasons, viewers were introduced to people preparing for all sorts of disasters, from earthquakes and economic collapse to, yes, pandemics

Why watch it? You may walk away with a desire to up your prep game.

""Hoarders""

'Hoarders'

Look, there's being prepared and then there's going too far. Yes, I'm looking at you, woman in line at Ralph's with four 12 packs of toilet paper.

Why watch it? This show might inspire you to take much-needed chill pill if you've in the last week cleaned out the cleaning aisle of your local Target.

Not a TV show: ""As Good As It Gets""

Jack Nicholson in 'As Good as It Gets'

MLB Life Put on Hold amid Rising Coronavirus Concerns,"Elaine Thompson/Associated Press

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. Ã¢ÂÂ Eeriness is the prevailing condition right now throughout spring training camps.

What do you do when you have no idea what's coming next?

""Oh, man,"" San Francisco Giants outfielder Alex Dickerson quipped Wednesday morning on his way out to the fields. ""This is where they've quarantined all of you?""

Four or five of us reporters were lined up against the wall outside of the Giants clubhouse under a narrow overhang, attempting to stay dry during a heavy rain. It wasn't actually a ""quarantine"" situation. But with media and anyone who isn't a player or ""essential employee"" currently barred from clubhouses as Major League Baseball and pretty much everyone else work to address the coronavirus pandemic, suddenly nobody is quite sure where to go or even how the game gets back to normal.

On the back fields over at the Chicago White Sox camp in Glendale, Arizona, on Tuesday, two players were about to take a golf cart over to the clubhouse following a morning workout when star shortstop Tim Anderson hitched a ride, standing on the back of the cart, where the clubs normally go. As they drove on a pathway with dozens of fans behind fences on either side, Anderson smiled wide and called out to them: ""Wash your hands! Wash your hands!""

Then, past the fans, Anderson kept hollering the same advice to random teammates too.

Every day brings more alarming news about COVID-19. Every hour delivers more unwelcome changes, decisions made to slow transmission rates of the virus.

About the time Dickerson kidded us reporters, San Francisco mayor London Breed was announcing that large public events with 1,000 or more people in attendance would be prohibited in the city. Shortly afterward, the Giants announced their March 24 Bay Bridge Series home game against Oakland would not take place, though alternate arrangements have not yet been announced. On Thursday, MLB announced that the remainder of spring training would be canceled for all teams and the regular season moved back by at least two weeks.

""You have to trust the higher powers who are making these decisions that are more informed than all of us are,"" Giants catcher Buster Posey said. ""Just roll with it. Do what you do for the time being. Hopefully you put your trust in people who are making good decisions for the whole.""

At Cincinnati's camp in Goodyear, Arizona, the Reds advised their players to avoid signing autographs, shaking hands or having any other kind of personal interactions with fans. To most players, that's a foreign concept at this time of year.

Baseball lifers are fond of repeating that the best thing about the game is that every single day you have a chance to see something you've never seen before.

Well, nobody has ever seen anything like this.

Walking into the White Sox complex early the other morning, it was impossible not to be overcome by the strangest of feelings: For the first time in memory, the clubhouse was off-limits to those chronicling the game.

When Sox manager Rick Renteria met the media outside later that morning, he sat at a picnic table, and a team media relations staffer asked the group to keep ""a safe distance"" from Renteria. As recommended to all clubs by MLB, in group settings, a distance of six feet of separation should be maintained until further notice. In one-on-one interviews, regular conversational distance is OK. The varying logistics feel awkward and a work in progress.

Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press/Associated Press

At the end of a long conversation with budding White Sox ace Lucas Giolito, I started to offer a handÃ¢ÂÂthen clumsily pulled back as Giolito extended his. I asked whether he was still a hand-shaker, and he said yes. So we shook.

In this atmosphere, both in baseball and, clearly, beyond, we are all rethinking even the most natural and mundane of movements.

It's difficult and uncomfortable for all.

Or, as third baseman Kris Bryant exclaimed Wednesday upon driving back to Cubs camp in Mesa, Arizona, from his Las Vegas home and an ultrasound appointment with his pregnant wife (""Everything's good""): ""This is really weird. This is really strange.""

He was sitting behind a microphone at a table in the team's media workroom, with the various reporters and camerapeople in a half-circle in front of him, yes, six feet or so back.

""We're all willing to accept what's keeping us safe and what's keeping everyone else safe,"" Bryant said. ""The situation is not ideal, but we'll work through it.

""I think we all need to take precautions. I have a lot of family members who are older, too, and I'd like to keep them safe.""

Before Thursday's announcement, spring training attendance hadn't seemed overly affected. Attendance is down a tick, but most people around the game believe it was because spring games are being played earlier in the month because of the previously scheduled March 26 Opening Day.

Everyone is cooperating in these first, awkward days. Team PR departments are bringing players, as requested, out of the clubhouse for interviews, and reporters are keeping their distance.

But it's not just the media coverage of the game that has been altered. Those who have been deemed nonessential personnel for the purposes of these protocols and disallowed from clubhouses include shoe representatives, bat reps, sunglass salespersonsÃ¢ÂÂall of the various roving equipment and fashion folks who weave their ways through camps each spring, supplying players with the latest goods and making money themselves.

Spring camps feel emptier now. It can be unsettling. And the players aren't necessarily enjoying the space and quiet.

Stephen Brashear/Associated Press/Associated Press/Associated Press/Associated Press

""It's [not] something we're used to,"" Posey said. ""But at the same time, back to my first point, we roll with it for now and hopefully it's one of those things where we're back to normal sooner rather than later.""

When that will be, nobody has a clue. The Mariners announced that a season-opening seven-game homestand against Texas and Minnesota later this month will be moved out of Seattle. Across sports, the impact is being felt. And in addition to the NBA suspending its season Wednesday, the NCAA has canceled its men's and women's basketball tournaments, and the NHL announced Thursday that its regular season would be paused.

Opening Day is now four weeks awayÃ¢ÂÂ¦or is it? That question is still very much up in the air.

And while the new restrictions may not seem onerous, they are sure to have impacts on the coverage of the game once play resumes. Clubhouse access is vital to gaining the kind of intimacy with players that allow them the comfort to reveal something of themselves beyond the numbers and the highlights. It allows them to show their humanity.

Cincinnati Reds first baseman Joey Votto explained the importance of proximity between the media and players when he was asked in an interview with Cincinnati reporters about whether there is value in having media members in the clubhouse.

""I'd say a vast majority of the stories involve nuance, emotion, personal relationships,"" Votto said, according to Bobby Nightengale of the Cincinnati Enquirer. ""Even if they are incorrect, a perception of how someone reacted or how a player reacted can be told in a facial expression or getting to know that person and tone.

""I think if you don't have that on a daily basis, you don't get to share those insights and, frankly, most fans don't care about the balls and strikes, runs and winsÃ¢ÂÂwell, I guess wins. They care about the person. They want to feel like they are close to the performer in any sport. I think that everyone in the media is the bridge that connects the athlete to the public. Without that close proximity, I personally don't think that you get that very human component.""

Clearly, the stakes for humanity right now are far greater than determinations of whether nonessential personnel are admitted to baseball clubhouses or whether games are played in empty stadiums or whether the games are even played at all. Chicago Cubs pitcher Yu Darvish was concerned enough about a looming pandemic that he spoke with club officials as soon as he arrived in Arizona last month and canceled a couple of public appearances over the winter, including one for which he agreed to pay a $10,000 cancellation fee.

As this all plays out in directions few could have imagined as recently as a week or two ago, we can only hope lives are protected, infections are contained and normalcy returns for all soon. In schools, at offices and, yes, in arenas and stadiums.

""People need to be considerate toward each other,"" Bryant reiterated. Citing advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to scrub hands for a minimum of 20 seconds, he said, ""Wash your hands. Sing 'Happy Birthday' twice. Sing 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame.'

""Sing whatever song you want. Just be considerate.""

'We are failing the elephants',"At least that's how I remember it. I was 7.

I'm wedged between a cousin and my father, my grandmother perched behind. We are in the back of an open pickup near the banks of the Olifants River in South Africa.

""Drive!"" we shout at my uncle in the cab, banging on the roof.

But banging on the roof is our signal to stop.

The truck stops and the elephant is right behind us. We can see the milk discharging from her teats. Her newborn is somewhere hidden in the bushes.

My dad pulls out an antique double-barreled shotgun. He loads it with birdshot to fire in the air.

""Don't shoot the elephant,"" my gran cries and smacks him.

It would be like shooting an elephant with a tic-tac.

I am crying, and so is my cousin. We smell the elephant musk; we can see the horizon through its legs.

My uncle sees the elephant looming in his rearview mirror. He hits the accelerator.

Outrunning the charging animal, we bounce along the dirt track. Shortly after, she turns back.

We are safe. Right around the corner, the truck's axle breaks in an aardvark hole.

My family often recounts this story. And from that incident, I learned elephants had to be respected -- even feared.

It means no worries

Imagine my alarm, then, nearly 30 years later, when I am assigned by CNN to a story in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.

The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.

The guide drives right up to a breeding herd of elephants in the grasslands and promptly switches off the engine.

""Shouldn't we keep it on,"" I say, ""and maybe not be so close.""

""The elephants here are relaxed,"" he smiles, ""Hakuna Matata.""

Meaning: ""No worries.""

I can't understand it. The elephants don't charge. They do not seem agitated, as has been my experience. They completely ignore us.

To be sure, elephants can be dangerous -- and sometimes deadly. But in this section of the Mara, there hasn't been hunting for decades. They are used to the tourist vehicles.

The game farm from my childhood near Olifants bordered a hunting reserve to the west. At the time, they still culled elephants in Kruger National Park to the east.

The elephants knew.

""Elephants have a cognitive sense of where they are safe and where they are at risk,"" Mike Chase, the lead scientist on the Great Elephant Census, told me on a recent trip to Botswana, where he's been tracking elephant movements for years. The census is a pioneering pan-African aerial survey that aims to count the continent's savanna elephant populations.

""This is really the front line, this is as far as they come, they will no longer move across eastern Namibia into Angola and Zambia, fearful of the consequences of poaching,"" says Chase.

As poaching rises, the elephants know to stay away.

And they remember.

No, they don't forget

It's sometimes tempting to anthropomorphize -- to give an animal human characteristics -- but the more I speak to people about elephants, the more elephants seem special.

I met up with Chase with Ingrid Formanek, one of CNN's most experienced field producers.

Ingrid's connection to Botswana runs deep.

In 1999 she moved to Maun, on the doorstep of the Okavango Delta, to document the rehabilitation of elephants. She lived there on and off for five years.

She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. Ingrid Formanek, CNN

Ingrid recounts the story of an elephant orphaned in the Kruger culls, called Shireni.

Shireni's handler taught her a trick: to remove her handler's hat with her trunk and to put it on her own head and then to put it back on her handler's. Ingrid observed as the elephant learned the behavior.

Nearly a decade later, Ingrid went back and saw Shireni.

""She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. She made the link to that time in our lives,"" says Ingrid. """"Shireni hadn't done that in all the interim years. I was amazed, and truth be told, flattered.""

Anybody who has studied or worked with elephants has their own stories about how sharp elephant memories are.

Experts like Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has rescued hundreds of orphaned calves, talks about elephants remembering people years later, and the things that happened to them -- good and bad.

Sheldrick speaks of elephants reintroduced to the wild who have returned years, sometimes decades, later for help with an injury or just to say ""hello.""

Vanishing herds

Despite their obvious emotional intelligence and survival instincts, elephants can't escape the ravages of humans.

Elephants are slaughtered by poachers who seek their ivory tusks.

Before European colonization, scientists believe that Africa may have held as many as 20 million elephants; by 1979 only 1.3 million remained -- and the Great Elephant Census revealed this year that things have gotten far worse.

In the seven years between 2007 and 2014, numbers plummeted by at least 30%, or 144,000 elephants.

As of July, Africa's savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census . Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.

And the specific cases are even more disturbing: In the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, elephant populations have plummeted by more than 75% in the past 10 years as poachers cut down family herds, according to the survey.

""When you think of how many elephants occurred in areas 10 or 20 years ago, it's incredibly disheartening,"" says Chase.

""Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.""

In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe. It was part of southern Africa's ""haven"" that comprises 60% of all savannah elephants counted in the census.

But the ivory poaching wars, driven primarily by Asian demand, are on its doorstep.

Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted. Mike Chase, Great Elephant Census

Botswana is fighting an unconventional war to try to stop the slaughter, with the Botswana Defense Force mobilized throughout the border region.

More than 700 specially trained soldiers are stationed in 40 bases in the far north.

That protection no longer seems enough.

A new memory

From a distance, it appears the elephant could be resting. But the smell reveals the truth.

A once glorious bull lies lifeless in a dry section of the Linyanti swamp in Botswana. His face hacked off by poachers.

As we approach, we see the tusks have been taken. The trunk is 10 paces from the body. The carcass is perhaps two or three days old. And it is just one of more than 20 we have counted in Linyanti in just over 48 hours.

Now, with current rates of poaching, they will be wiped out from some of their range states.

They could even go locally extinct, says Chase.

""I've been asked if I'm optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Africa's elephants,"" he says, ""and on days like today, I feel that we are failing the elephants.""

This horrific scene could be the only way we remember them.",human
Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.,"The young mothers didnÃ¢ÂÂt tell their children they had the coronavirus. Mama was working hard, they said, to save sick people. Instead, Deng Danjing and Xia Sisi were fighting for their lives in the same hospitals where they worked, weak from fever and gasping for breath. Within a matter of weeks, they had gone from healthy medical professionals on the front lines of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, to coronavirus patients in critical condition. The world is still struggling to fully understand the new virus, its symptoms, spread and sources. For some, it can feel like a common cold. For others, it is a deadly infection that ravages the lungs and pushes the immune system into overdrive, destroying even healthy cells. The difference between life and death can depend on the patientÃ¢ÂÂs health, age and access to care Ã¢ÂÂ although not always. The virus has infected more than 132,000 globally. The vast majority of cases have been mild, with limited symptoms. But the virusÃ¢ÂÂs progression can be quick, at which point the chances of survival plummet. Around 68,000 people have recovered, while nearly 5,000 have died. The fates of Ms. Deng and Dr. Xia reflect the unpredictable nature of a virus that affects everyone differently, at times defying statistical averages and scientific research. As the new year opened in China, the women were leading remarkably similar lives. Both were 29 years old. Both were married, each with a young child on whom she doted. Ms. Deng, a nurse, had worked for three years at Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, in the city where she grew up and where the coronavirus pandemic began. Her mother was a nurse there, too, and in their free time they watched movies or shopped together. Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs favorite activity was playing with her two pet kittens, Fat Tiger and Little White, the second of which she had rescued just three months before falling sick. Before the epidemic, Ms. Deng had promised to take her 5-year-old daughter to the aquarium. Dr. Xia, a gastroenterologist, also came from a family of medical professionals. As a young child, she had accompanied her mother, a nurse, to work. She joined the Union Jiangbei Hospital of Wuhan in 2015 and was the youngest doctor in her department. Her colleagues called her Ã¢ÂÂLittle SisiÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂLittle SweetieÃ¢ÂÂ because she always had a smile for them. She loved Sichuan hot pot, a dish famous for its numbingly spicy broth. Dr. Xia loved traveling with her family. She had recently visited Wuzhizhou Island, a resort destination off the southern coast of China. When a mysterious new virus struck the city, the women began working long hours, treating a seemingly endless flood of patients. They took precautions to protect themselves. But they succumbed to the infection, the highly contagious virus burrowing deep into their lungs, causing fever and pneumonia. In the hospital, each took a turn for the worse. One recovered. One did not.

Symptoms Onset of virus & hospitalization Ms. Deng, a Wuhan native who liked makeup and hanging out with her friends at Starbucks, had worked for eight years as a nurse, following her motherÃ¢ÂÂs career path. Dr. Xia, who was a favorite among elderly patients, spent long hours at the hospital helping to treat people suspected of having the virus. The symptoms came on suddenly. Dr. Xia had ended her night shift on Jan. 14 when she was called back to attend to a patient Ã¢ÂÂ a 76-year-old man with suspected coronavirus. She dropped in frequently to check in on him. Five days later, she started feeling unwell. Exhausted, she took a two-hour nap at home, then checked her temperature: It was 102 degrees. Her chest felt tight. A few weeks later, in early February, Ms. Deng, the nurse, was preparing to eat dinner at the hospital office, when the sight of food left her nauseated. She brushed the feeling aside, figuring she was worn out by work. She had spent the beginning of the outbreak visiting the families of confirmed patients and teaching them to disinfect their homes. After forcing down some food, Ms. Deng went home to shower, and then, feeling groggy, took a nap. When she woke up, her temperature was 100 degrees. Fever is the most common symptom of the coronavirus, seen in nearly 90 percent of patients. About a fifth of people experience shortness of breath, often including a cough and congestion. Many also feel fatigued. Both women rushed to see doctors. Chest scans showed damage to their lungs, a tell-tale sign of the coronavirus that is present in at least 85 percent of patients, according to one study. In particular, Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs CT scan showed what the doctor called ground-glass opacities on her lower right lung Ã¢ÂÂ hazy spots that indicated fluid or inflammation around her airways. The hospital had no space, so Ms. Deng checked into a hotel to avoid infecting her husband and 5-year-old daughter. She sweated through the night. At one point, her calf twitched. In the morning, she was admitted to the hospital. Her throat was swabbed for a genetic test, which confirmed she had the coronavirus. Her room in a newly opened staff ward was small, with two cots and a number assigned to each one. Ms. Deng was in bed 28. Her roommate was a colleague who had also been diagnosed with the virus. At Jiangbei Hospital, 18 miles away, Dr. Xia was struggling to breathe. She was placed in an isolation ward, treated by doctors and nurses who wore protective suits and safety goggles. The room was cold.

Treatment Day 1, hospitalization begins After Ms. Deng was admitted to the hospital, she told her husband to take care of himself, reminding him of the 14-day incubation period for the virus. He assured her his temperature was normal. Dr. Xia asked her husband about the possibility of getting off oxygen therapy soon. He responded optimistically. When Ms. Deng checked into the hospital, she tried to stay upbeat. She texted her husband, urging him to wear a mask even at home, and to clean all their bowls and chopsticks with boiling water or throw them out. Her husband sent a photograph of one of their cats at home. Ã¢ÂÂWaiting for you to come back,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂI think itÃ¢ÂÂll take 10 days, half a month,Ã¢ÂÂ she replied. Ã¢ÂÂTake care of yourself.Ã¢ÂÂ There is no known cure for Covid-19, the official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. So doctors rely on a cocktail of other medicines, mostly antiviral drugs, to alleviate the symptoms. Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs doctor prescribed a regimen of arbidol, an antiviral medicine used to treat the flu in Russia and China; Tamiflu, another flu medicine more popular internationally; and Kaletra, an HIV medicine thought to block the replication of the virus. Ms. Deng was taking at least 12 pills a day, as well as traditional Chinese medicine. Arbidol, an antiviral medication, was prescribed to help alleviate Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs symptoms. Despite her optimism, she grew weaker. Her mother delivered home-cooked food outside the ward, but she had no appetite. To feed her, a nurse had to come at 8:30 each morning to hook her up to an intravenous drip with nutrients. Another drip pumped antibodies into her bloodstream, and still another antiviral medicine. Dr. Xia, too, was severely ill, but appeared to be slowly fighting the infection. Her fever had subsided after a few days, and she began to breathe more easily after being attached to a ventilator. Her spirits lifted. On Jan. 25, she told her colleagues she was recovering. Ã¢ÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂª I will return to the team soon,Ã¢ÂÂ she texted them on WeChat. Ã¢ÂÂWe need you the most,Ã¢ÂÂ one of her colleagues responded. In early February, Dr. Xia asked her husband, Wu Shilei, also a doctor, whether he thought she could get off oxygen therapy soon. Ã¢ÂÂTake it easy. DonÃ¢ÂÂt be too anxious,Ã¢ÂÂ he replied on WeChat. He told her that the ventilator could possibly be removed by the following week. Ã¢ÂÂI keep on thinking about getting better soon,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Xia responded. There was reason to believe she was on the mend. After all, most coronavirus patients recover. Later, Dr. Xia tested negative twice for the coronavirus. She told her mother she expected to be discharged on Feb. 8.

Decline Day 4 to 16 after hospitalization In the hospital, Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs only contacts were her roommate and the medical staff. She added a caption to a photo with her doctor, saying laughter would help chase the illness away. Two tests indicated that Dr. Xia was free of the virus, but her condition suddenly deteriorated. By Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs fourth day in the hospital, she could no longer pretend to be cheerful. She was vomiting, having diarrhea and relentlessly shivering. Her fever jumped to 101.3 degrees. Early in the morning on Feb. 5, she woke from a fitful sleep to find the medicine had done nothing to lower her temperature. She cried. She said she was classified as critically ill. The next day, she threw up three times, until she was left spitting white bubbles. She felt she was hallucinating. She could not smell or taste, and her heart rate slowed to about 50 beats per minute. On a phone call, Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs mother tried to reassure her that she was young and otherwise healthy, and that the virus would pass like a bad cold. But Ms. Deng feared otherwise. Ã¢ÂÂI felt like I was walking on the edge of death,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote in a social media post from her hospital bed the next day. China defines a critically ill patient as someone with respiratory failure, shock or organ failure. Around 5 percent of infected patients became critical in China, according to one of the largest studies to date of coronavirus cases. Of those, 49 percent died. (Those rates may eventually change once more cases are examined around the world.) While Dr. Xia appeared to be recovering, she was still terrified of dying. Testing can be faulty, and negative results donÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily mean patients are in the clear. She asked her mother for a promise: Could her parents look after her 2-year-old son if she didnÃ¢ÂÂt make it? Hoping to dispel her anxiety with humor, her mother, Jiang Wenyan, chided her: Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs your own son. DonÃ¢ÂÂt you want to raise him yourself?Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Xia also worried about her husband. Over video chat, she urged him to put on protective equipment at the hospital where he worked. Ã¢ÂÂShe said she would wait for me to return safely,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, Ã¢ÂÂand go to the frontline again with me when she recovered.Ã¢ÂÂ Then came the call. Dr. XiaÃ¢ÂÂs condition had suddenly deteriorated. In the early hours of Feb. 7, her husband rushed to the emergency room. Her heart had stopped.

Recovery Day 17 after hospitalization After being discharged, Ms. Deng briefly got to see her mother, who had been working at the hospital during her illness. She then went home to isolate herself for two weeks. In most cases, the body repairs itself. The immune system produces enough antibodies to clear the virus, and the patient recovers. By the end of Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs first week in the hospital, her fever had receded. She could eat the food her mother delivered. On Feb. 10, as her appetite returned, she looked up photos of meat skewers online and posted them wishfully to social media. On Feb. 15, her throat swab came back negative for the virus. Three days later, she tested negative again. She could go home. Ms. Deng met her mother briefly at the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs entrance. Then, because Wuhan remained locked down, without taxis or public transportation, she walked home alone. Ã¢ÂÂI felt like a little bird,Ã¢ÂÂ she recalled. Ã¢ÂÂMy freedom had been returned to me.Ã¢ÂÂ She had to isolate at home for 14 days. Her husband and daughter stayed with her parents. At home, she threw out her clothing, which she had been wearing for her entire time in the hospital. Since then, she has passed the time by playing with her cats and watching television. She jokes that she is getting an early taste of retirement. She does daily deep breathing exercises to strengthen her lungs, and her cough has faded. The Chinese government has urged recovered patients to donate plasma, which experts say contains antibodies that could be used to treat the sick. Ms. Deng contacted a local blood bank soon after getting home. She plans to go back to work as soon as the hospital allows it. Ã¢ÂÂIt was the nation that saved me,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂAnd I think I can pay it back to the nation.Ã¢ÂÂ",human

I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"In the quiet corners of the schoolyard, far from the bustling cliques and energetic games, 35-year-old Jessica Morgan found herself retracing the memories of her own childhood. Now a parent to a spirited seven-year-old, she reflects on her past as the unpopular kid and how those experiences have shaped her approach to parenting today.

Jessica, like many parents, spends a significant portion of her day ensuring her daughter, Lily, is equipped for school. Yet, unlike some, her focus extends beyond the typical concerns of school supplies and homework. She is deeply attuned to her daughter’s social world, a sensitivity rooted in her own experiences growing up as an outsider.

“Back then, I often felt invisible,” Jessica recounts with a reflective tone. “I wasn’t part of any specific group, and the lunchroom could feel like a battleground of social hierarchies.” While many might consider these memories painful, Jessica sees them as a wellspring of valuable lessons for both herself and her daughter.

As a child, Jessica found solace in books and art, nurturing an imagination that would later serve her well in her career as a graphic designer. Her parents, though supportive, struggled to understand the emotional nuances of her situation. “They did their best but often told me to just ignore it and focus on my studies,” she recalls. “I think they didn’t quite grasp how isolating it felt.”

This backdrop of misunderstanding is precisely what Jessica aims to avoid with Lily. “I want her to feel heard, to know that her feelings are valid,” she emphasizes. Rather than dismissing her daughter’s social challenges, Jessica engages in open dialogues, encouraging Lily to express herself and articulate her feelings. “We have a nightly routine where we talk about the best and worst parts of her day. It’s a small thing, but it makes a big difference.”

Jessica’s approach is supported by research in child psychology, which suggests that children who feel heard and understood by their parents tend to develop healthier emotional and social skills. Dr. Karen Fields, a child psychologist based in New York, notes, “Parents who validate their children’s feelings set a foundation for resilience and self-esteem. It’s about creating an environment where kids feel safe to share and navigate their social worlds.”

This focus on communication and emotional intelligence is not the only lesson Jessica has carried from her childhood. Her experiences have also ingrained a deep sense of empathy and inclusion. “I remember what it felt like to be left out, so I encourage Lily to be inclusive and kind,” Jessica explains. “Whether it’s inviting someone new to join a game or standing up for a friend, I want her to understand the importance of kindness.”

Jessica’s story resonates with many adults who once felt marginalized during their school years. Social media platforms and online forums are filled with discussions where parents share similar experiences and strategies. These conversations reveal a common desire: to help their children navigate the complexities of social interactions with more confidence and support than they once had.

For Jessica, the journey from unpopular kid to parent is one of healing and growth. She acknowledges that the challenges she faced as a child were formative, but they do not define her. “I wouldn’t say it was easy, but it taught me resilience and empathy—qualities I hope to pass on to Lily,” she says with a smile.

As her daughter begins to carve her own path in the world, Jessica remains a steadfast guide, drawing on the lessons of her past to foster a nurturing and understanding environment. “I want her to know that it’s okay to be different, to embrace who she is,” Jessica concludes. “Because in the end, it’s those differences that make us unique.”

In a world where the pressures of fitting in can be overwhelming, Jessica Morgan’s story is a testament to the enduring power of empathy, communication, and kindness. As she continues to navigate the challenges of parenting, she does so with the wisdom of someone who has walked a similar path—and emerged stronger for it.",gpt
The coronavirus pandemic is closing schools. How will kids eat?,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep across the globe, its impact is being felt in every corner of society. One particularly pressing concern is the closure of schools, a move deemed necessary to slow the spread of the virus. However, this has raised a critical question: how will children who rely on school meals for their daily nutrition cope with the sudden disruption?

In the United States, millions of children depend on the National School Lunch Program, which provides free or reduced-price lunches to students from low-income families. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2019 alone, more than 29.4 million students benefited from this program. With schools shutting their doors to prevent the virus's spread, these children face the risk of food insecurity.

The problem is not confined to the United States. Globally, more than 368 million children across 143 countries rely on school meal programs, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). As the pandemic forces schools to close, these children are left vulnerable, prompting governments and organizations to devise strategies to ensure that no child goes hungry during the crisis.

In response to this urgent issue, some school districts in the United States have initiated ""grab-and-go"" meal programs. These allow families to pick up meals from designated school sites, ensuring that children still receive the nutrition they need. In New York City, for instance, the Department of Education has set up over 400 meal hubs across the city, providing breakfast and lunch to any student in need.

Similarly, in California, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has partnered with the Red Cross to distribute meals. LAUSD has established dozens of Grab & Go Food Centers, which provide food packages to students and their families. Such initiatives are crucial in a state where, according to the California Department of Education, over 60% of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals.

On the international front, countries are employing a variety of strategies to address the challenge. In France, the government is working with local municipalities to set up distribution points where families can collect food supplies. In Kenya, the government, in partnership with non-governmental organizations, is exploring the delivery of food parcels to children who are no longer able to attend school.

However, these initiatives are not without their challenges. Logistical hurdles, such as ensuring social distancing during food distribution and reaching children in remote areas, pose significant difficulties. Funding is another major concern, as many school districts and governments were unprepared for the sudden financial burden of extending meal programs beyond school premises.

To tackle these issues, several non-profit organizations and private companies have stepped in to provide support. Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks, has partnered with local agencies to distribute meals to children and families affected by school closures. In addition, some tech companies have pledged financial support to bolster these efforts, recognizing the crucial role they play in maintaining societal stability during the pandemic.

Despite these efforts, experts caution that there is still much work to be done. ""While the response has been commendable, it's important that we continue to innovate and adapt to the evolving situation,"" says Dr. Jennifer Wilson, a public health expert specializing in nutrition. ""We must ensure that children not only have access to food but that the food is nutritious and meets their dietary needs.""

As the pandemic continues to unfold, it is clear that the issue of child nutrition will remain a critical area of focus. Ensuring that children receive the sustenance they need during these challenging times is not just a matter of public health but a fundamental aspect of safeguarding their well-being and future potential.

In the weeks and months ahead, governments, organizations, and communities will need to work together more closely than ever to address this pressing challenge. The resilience and creativity shown thus far offer hope that, even in the face of unprecedented disruption, solutions can be found to ensure that no child goes hungry.",gpt
US-Mexico border: Pregnant woman from Guatemala dies after fall from wall,"In a tragic incident at the US-Mexico border, a pregnant woman from Guatemala has died after falling from the border wall, highlighting ongoing concerns about the dangers faced by migrants attempting to enter the United States. The woman, identified by Guatemalan authorities as 23-year-old Rosa María López, fell from a height of approximately 20 feet while trying to scale the barrier in Texas. The incident occurred late Wednesday night near the town of Sunland Park, which borders El Paso, Texas.

According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), agents on patrol in the area responded immediately to the scene after receiving an alert from surveillance cameras. López was found in critical condition and was rushed to a nearby hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries. Officials have confirmed that she was several months pregnant at the time of her death.

In an official statement, CBP expressed condolences to the family of the deceased and reiterated the inherent risks associated with attempting to cross the border illegally. ""This tragic incident underscores the dangers migrants face when they place their lives in the hands of unscrupulous smugglers,"" the statement read. ""We continue to emphasize the importance of safe and legal immigration pathways.""

Guatemalan consular officials have been notified and are coordinating with U.S. authorities to ensure the repatriation of López’s body. The Guatemalan government has also issued a statement urging its citizens to reconsider dangerous migration routes and promising continued efforts to address the root causes of migration such as poverty and violence.

The incident has reignited debate over the efficacy and human cost of the current U.S. border policy. Human rights organizations have long criticized the physical barriers and enforcement tactics as not only ineffective in deterring migration but also as contributing factors to the increasing number of migrant deaths. ""Walls and deterrence strategies are not solving the problem,"" said Marisol Bueno, spokesperson for the advocacy group Border Angels. ""They are only making the journey more perilous.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported a significant increase in the number of encounters with migrants at the southern border in recent years. In fiscal year 2023 alone, CBP recorded over two million migrant encounters, a trend that experts attribute to a complex interplay of factors including economic instability, climate change, and violence in home countries.

In response to the ongoing crisis, the Biden administration has sought to balance enforcement with humanitarian considerations. Earlier this year, the administration announced a series of measures aimed at expanding legal pathways for migrants, including increasing refugee admissions and accelerating the processing of asylum claims. However, critics argue that these measures are insufficient and have called for comprehensive immigration reform to address systemic issues.

Meanwhile, in communities along the border, the humanitarian toll of these policies is acutely felt. Local aid organizations and volunteers continue to provide assistance to migrants in distress, offering food, medical care, and shelter. ""Our hearts go out to the family of this young woman,"" said José González, a volunteer with the El Paso-based Hope Border Institute. ""Every life lost is a tragedy, and we must do better to protect those seeking safety and a better life.""

This latest incident also highlights the critical role of smugglers in the perilous journeys undertaken by migrants. Often referred to as “coyotes,” these individuals and networks exploit vulnerable migrants, charging exorbitant fees to guide them through treacherous terrain. Despite the known risks, many migrants still turn to smugglers as their best chance of reaching the U.S., driven by desperation and a lack of viable alternatives.

As investigations into the circumstances surrounding López’s death continue, both U.S. and Guatemalan authorities are likely to face increased scrutiny over their handling of migration issues. For López’s family, the loss is deeply personal. ""She was just looking for a better future for her child,"" said a relative, who wished to remain anonymous. ""Now she is gone, and we are left to mourn.""

The tragic death of Rosa María López serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of migration and the urgent need for policies that prioritize safety and dignity for all individuals seeking refuge. As the debate over immigration policy continues, the voices of those most affected by these decisions must not be forgotten.",gpt
An Online Generation Redefines Mourning,"In the digital age, the way people mourn the loss of loved ones is undergoing a profound transformation. With the rise of social media, online memorials, and virtual support groups, a new generation is reshaping how society deals with grief, blending traditional customs with modern technology to create personal and communal spaces for mourning.

In recent years, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have become unexpected venues for public expressions of grief. Hashtags such as #griefjourney and #digitalmemorials allow users to share memories, photos, and tributes to those who have passed away. These online spaces offer a sense of community and support, as users can connect with others who are experiencing similar losses.

According to Dr. Megan L. Hess, a sociologist specializing in digital culture, the shift towards online mourning reflects broader changes in how younger generations engage with technology. ""This generation has grown up with social media as a central part of their lives,"" Hess explains. ""It's natural for them to use these platforms to process and express their grief. These online interactions can be incredibly validating and empowering.""

One significant aspect of digital mourning is the creation of online memorial pages. These digital spaces serve as a permanent tribute to the deceased, allowing friends and family to continue sharing memories and messages long after traditional services have ended. Facebook, for instance, offers the option to memorialize a user's profile, preserving their digital presence while giving loved ones a place to gather and remember.

The benefits of online mourning extend beyond the ability to share memories. Virtual support groups, accessible through platforms like Reddit and specialized grief websites, provide spaces for individuals to connect with others who understand their experiences. These groups offer emotional support and practical advice, helping participants navigate the complexities of loss in a more accessible and immediate way than traditional support systems might allow.

Despite the advantages, the digitalization of mourning is not without its challenges. Privacy concerns and the permanence of online content can complicate the grieving process. Some people may struggle with the idea of publicly sharing their grief, while others worry about who controls the deceased's digital legacy. Social media platforms have begun addressing these concerns by offering users greater control over their digital presence, allowing them to designate legacy contacts or decide what happens to their accounts after they pass away.

In addition to privacy issues, the nature of digital mourning can sometimes lead to unexpected emotional impacts. The constant accessibility of memories and tributes can make it difficult for some individuals to find closure, as they are repeatedly confronted with reminders of their loss. However, Dr. Hess believes that this ongoing connection can also be seen as a positive development. ""For many, having a place to return to, to see that someone is remembered and celebrated, can provide comfort and healing over time,"" she notes.

The changing landscape of mourning is also influencing how traditional funeral services are conducted. Many funeral homes now offer livestreaming options, allowing family and friends who cannot attend in person to participate in services remotely. This hybrid approach enables a broader community to come together in mourning, regardless of geographical constraints.

As society continues to adapt to the digital age, experts anticipate further innovations in how we commemorate and honor the deceased. Virtual reality experiences, for example, are being explored as a new way to create immersive memorials, offering mourners an opportunity to engage with memories in a more interactive and personal manner.

Ultimately, the evolution of mourning practices reflects the diverse ways in which people experience and process grief. While some may prefer the intimacy of a private gathering, others find solace in the public expressions of remembrance that digital platforms provide. As this online generation continues to redefine mourning, the emphasis remains on creating supportive, inclusive spaces where individuals can share their grief and celebrate the lives of those they have lost.

In navigating this new landscape, the challenge remains to balance the immediacy and connectivity of digital mourning with the need for privacy, reflection, and healing. As these practices continue to evolve, they offer a glimpse into the future of how society will honor and remember its loved ones in an increasingly interconnected world.",gpt
"In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism","In 2017, a year marked by political turbulence and societal shifts, the presidency of Donald Trump unexpectedly influenced three significant cultural and social domains: feminism, satire, and journalism. As the 45th President of the United States, Trump's policies and rhetoric inadvertently galvanized movements and industries that had been struggling to maintain momentum.

The revival of feminism during Trump's tenure was one of the most pronounced social phenomena of the year. His election served as a catalyst for the Women's March on January 21, 2017, which became one of the largest single-day protests in U.S. history. With millions participating worldwide, the march symbolized a unified stance against the perceived misogyny, racism, and xenophobia that many associated with Trump's campaign and administration.

This burgeoning feminist wave was not limited to the streets. It also permeated popular culture and social media, giving rise to movements such as #MeToo, which encouraged survivors of sexual harassment and assault to share their stories. The movement, initially founded by activist Tarana Burke in 2006, gained unprecedented traction in the Trump era. Feminists across the globe found a renewed sense of purpose, organizing to advocate for gender equality, reproductive rights, and more diverse representation in political and corporate spaces.

Meanwhile, Trump's presidency also breathed new life into satire. Comedians, writers, and entertainers found ample material in the daily controversies and eccentricities of the administration. Late-night television, in particular, saw a resurgence in viewership, with hosts like Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver dedicating significant airtime to dissecting and lampooning the latest developments from the White House.

Satirical publications, such as The Onion and The Borowitz Report, also experienced a renaissance, as readers sought humor and levity amidst the chaos. The demand for political satire reflected a collective need to process the news through a lens of humor, providing a coping mechanism for those overwhelmed by the rapid pace of political developments.

In the realm of journalism, Trump's presidency marked a significant turning point. His frequent attacks on the press, labeling them as ""fake news"" and the ""enemy of the people,"" prompted a renewed commitment to journalistic integrity and fact-based reporting. Major news outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN, experienced a surge in subscriptions as the public turned to trusted sources for accurate information.

Journalists found themselves on the front lines of a battle for truth, diligently fact-checking the administration's statements and policies. Investigative journalism flourished, with reporters unearthing critical stories that held the government accountable. The Pulitzer Prizes awarded in the years following 2017 reflect this renaissance, recognizing outstanding investigative work that exposed corruption and challenged power structures.

Moreover, Trump's presidency sparked a broader conversation about media literacy and the importance of supporting independent journalism. Initiatives aimed at combating misinformation and educating the public on how to discern credible news sources gained traction, highlighting the evolving role of journalism in the digital age.

While Trump's impact on these areas was often indirect, the effects were undeniably profound. Feminism, satire, and journalism, each invigorated by the political climate, played pivotal roles in shaping public discourse and fostering civic engagement. The resurgence of these movements underscored the resilience of democratic institutions and the enduring power of free expression.

As 2017 drew to a close, the landscape of American society had been irrevocably altered. Feminists continued to advocate for systemic change, satirists provided a critical yet humorous perspective on current events, and journalists upheld their duty as watchdogs of democracy.

Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"In a significant move to address the escalating coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, unlocking critical resources and regulatory flexibility to combat the spread of COVID-19. The declaration, made during a press conference in the Rose Garden, is a strategic maneuver aimed at enhancing the federal government's response capabilities and providing much-needed support to states and healthcare systems across the nation.

The national emergency declaration under the Stafford Act enables the federal government to allocate up to $50 billion in disaster relief funds to states, territories, and localities. This financial assistance is designed to bolster efforts to mitigate the impact of the virus, which has resulted in thousands of confirmed cases and significant disruptions to daily life in the United States.

One of the immediate effects of the declaration is the expansion of the federal government's powers to coordinate and streamline the response to the pandemic. This includes the ability to waive certain regulations and requirements that could hinder the rapid deployment of resources and medical personnel. For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can now grant waivers that allow hospitals to increase their capacity to treat patients more efficiently, including the ability to set up temporary medical sites and provide care in non-traditional settings.

Additionally, the declaration facilitates the federal government's partnership with private industry to expedite the production and distribution of medical supplies and testing kits. This collaboration is crucial as the nation faces shortages of vital equipment, such as ventilators, masks, and personal protective gear for healthcare workers. By invoking emergency powers, the administration aims to address these deficits swiftly and ensure that frontline medical professionals are adequately equipped to handle the influx of COVID-19 patients.

Testing for the virus is another critical component addressed by the emergency declaration. President Trump announced measures to expand testing capabilities, including authorizing new laboratories to conduct tests and removing regulatory barriers that could delay the approval of new testing methods. The increased availability of testing is expected to provide a clearer picture of the virus's spread and inform public health strategies moving forward.

Moreover, the declaration allows for the activation of the National Guard, if necessary, to assist in logistics, medical response, and other support roles as determined by state governors. This component underscores the federal government's commitment to providing comprehensive support to state and local authorities as they navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Despite the sweeping measures introduced by the emergency declaration, President Trump emphasized the importance of individual and community action in curbing the virus's spread. He urged Americans to follow guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including practicing social distancing, frequent handwashing, and staying home when feeling unwell. The administration also launched a public-private partnership to facilitate drive-through testing in critical areas, utilizing the networks of major retailers and pharmacies.

The declaration has been met with a mix of relief and criticism. Supporters argue that it demonstrates a proactive and necessary response to an unprecedented public health emergency, while critics contend that the administration's initial handling of the outbreak was marked by delays and inconsistent messaging.

As the United States grapples with the evolving situation, the national emergency declaration serves as a pivotal step in the ongoing effort to manage and ultimately overcome the COVID-19 crisis. With the full resources of the federal government now mobilized, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining the effectiveness of these measures and the nation's ability to contain the virus's spread.

This declaration marks a critical juncture in the nation's response to the pandemic, emphasizing the importance of federal, state, and local collaboration, as well as the collective responsibility of all Americans to take decisive action to protect public health.",gpt
Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"In the ever-evolving landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials across the United States have faced a myriad of challenges, from managing public health responses to navigating politically charged environments. Recently, some officials have been observed turning to a surprising strategy when confronted with difficult questions about the pandemic: praising former President Donald Trump.

This pattern, which has been noted in several states, appears to be a tactical move aimed at appeasing certain segments of the public who remain loyal to Trump and his handling of the pandemic. It also underscores the lingering influence of the former president in political and public health discourse.

In states like Florida and Texas, where local governments have often clashed with federal health guidelines, officials have occasionally deflected criticism by highlighting Trump's early initiatives in vaccine development. ""Operation Warp Speed was a significant achievement,"" said one health official at a recent press briefing in Tallahassee. ""It laid the groundwork for the rapid distribution of vaccines that we're seeing today.""

Such comments are not without precedent. During Trump's presidency, health officials often walked a tightrope, balancing public health advice with political considerations. Now, as the pandemic continues to pose challenges, some officials are finding it beneficial to acknowledge Trump's contributions, particularly in areas where his base remains influential.

A health department spokesperson in Texas noted, ""Acknowledging the past administration's role in vaccine development can sometimes help in bridging divides and focusing on the common goal of overcoming this pandemic.""

Critics, however, argue that these instances of praise are more than just strategic placations. They suggest that such comments risk politicizing public health further and could undermine trust in current health initiatives. ""It's concerning when health communication becomes a political tool,"" said Dr. Elaine Morrison, a public health expert at the University of California. ""We need clear, consistent messaging based on science, not political expediency.""

The extent of Trump's influence was highlighted in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, which found that a significant portion of Americans still credit him with the success of the vaccine rollout. This sentiment is particularly strong among Republicans, 60% of whom view Trump's handling of the pandemic positively.

For some officials, aligning with this sentiment appears to be a pragmatic approach. In states where Trump remains popular, acknowledging his role in pandemic efforts can potentially bolster public cooperation with health measures. ""It's about finding common ground,"" explained a senior health advisor in Georgia. ""If recognizing past achievements can help in getting people vaccinated or following guidelines, it's worth considering.""

Nevertheless, the strategy is not without risks. Public health messaging can become muddled when officials are perceived as prioritizing political considerations over scientific facts. This concern is echoed by Dr. Robert Allen, a former CDC director, who warns that the politicization of health discussions could further erode public trust. ""We've seen how divisive rhetoric can impact public health efforts,"" he said. ""It's crucial that health officials maintain their focus on evidence-based practices.""

Looking forward, it remains to be seen how long this tactic will persist and whether it will have any lasting impact on public health strategies. The Biden administration has continued to emphasize a science-driven approach, while also acknowledging the previous administration's contributions to vaccine development.

Ultimately, the success of public health initiatives in combating COVID-19 may depend on the ability of officials to navigate these complex dynamics, balancing political realities with the urgent need for clear, consistent health guidance. As the pandemic continues, the role of political considerations in health communication will likely remain a contentious issue, shaping both public perception and policy outcomes.",gpt
Holi celebrated with face masks and color explosions amid coronavirus fears,"As the vibrant festival of Holi unfolded across India this year, the usual bursts of color were accompanied by an unusual accessory: face masks. Amid ongoing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, revelers celebrated cautiously, balancing the joy of tradition with the necessity of safety.

In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, the streets were alive with color as people took part in the iconic festival, marking the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. However, this year’s festivities were noticeably different as participants donned masks alongside their traditional attire to curb the spread of the virus.

Local governments across India had issued guidelines encouraging people to celebrate responsibly. In many regions, authorities limited the size of public gatherings, urging citizens to stay within their communities and avoid large crowds. Despite these restrictions, the spirit of Holi endured, with families and friends gathering in smaller groups to exchange colors, sweets, and laughter.

Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Delhi, expressed a sentiment shared by many: “Holi is a time for joy and togetherness, and while we need to be careful, it’s important not to lose the spirit of the festival. Wearing a mask is a small price to pay for the safety of our loved ones.”

In several areas, organizers of public Holi events implemented measures to ensure safety. Hand sanitizing stations were set up, and participants were encouraged to use organic colors to minimize skin irritation, especially when combined with mask-wearing. Some events even offered masks in festive colors, blending safety with tradition.

The economic impact of the pandemic was also evident. Many small businesses that rely on Holi for a significant portion of their annual income faced challenges. Vendors selling colors, water balloons, and traditional sweets reported lower sales compared to pre-pandemic years. “It’s been tough,” said Sunita Sharma, a shop owner in Jaipur. “Fewer people are buying in bulk this year, but we’re hopeful that things will improve.”

Despite these challenges, some businesses adapted by offering online sales and home delivery services. This approach seemed to resonate with consumers who preferred to avoid crowded markets. E-commerce platforms reported a surge in sales of Holi-related products, from colors and water guns to traditional clothing.

Health experts warned that while outdoor celebrations are generally safer than indoor gatherings, the risk of transmission still exists, particularly in densely populated areas. Dr. Anil Verma, an epidemiologist in Mumbai, emphasized the importance of vaccination and adherence to safety protocols. “Vaccination remains our best defense against the virus,” he said. “Even during festivities, it’s crucial to follow guidelines to protect ourselves and others.”

The festival’s significance was not lost on those who have endured the hardships of the pandemic. Many saw Holi as an opportunity to reconnect and find solace in cultural traditions after months of isolation and uncertainty. “This year, Holi feels more meaningful,” said Priya Nair, a student in Bengaluru. “It’s a reminder of resilience and hope, even in difficult times.”

Social media played a significant role in this year’s celebrations, with people sharing videos and photos of their colorful experiences while encouraging others to celebrate responsibly. Hashtags such as #MaskedHoli and #SafeHoli trended on platforms like Twitter and Instagram, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility.

As the day drew to a close, the streets were awash in hues of pink, blue, and green, a testament to the enduring spirit of Holi. While the pandemic has altered the way people celebrate, it has also underscored the festival’s core message of unity and renewal.

As India continues to navigate the challenges posed by the coronavirus, the celebration of Holi served as a poignant reminder of the resilience and adaptability of its people. With face masks and color explosions, the festival brought a welcome splash of joy in uncertain times, as communities across the nation came together, albeit cautiously, to celebrate life and hope.",gpt
America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down,"As the United States enters its third winter grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, the nation is bracing for what many health experts are calling a ""new normal."" The virus, which has already claimed over a million lives in the country, shows no signs of abating, despite widespread vaccination efforts and public health campaigns.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of new COVID-19 cases has plateaued at a high level, with occasional surges in different regions. This persistent presence of the virus poses ongoing challenges for both public health officials and the general population.

Health experts warn that the virus may never fully disappear. ""COVID-19 is likely to become endemic, meaning it will always be with us in some form,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert. ""Our strategy now is to minimize its impact and prevent serious outcomes through vaccination, treatments, and public health measures.""

The Biden administration has continued to advocate for vaccinations as the primary tool in combating the virus. As of now, approximately 70% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, and booster shots have been made available to enhance immunity against new variants. Still, vaccine hesitancy remains a significant hurdle, particularly in certain states and communities.

In addition to vaccines, new antiviral treatments have been introduced, offering hope for reducing hospitalizations and deaths. Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's molnupiravir have been authorized for emergency use, providing a crucial line of defense for those who contract the virus. However, distribution and accessibility of these treatments remain challenges that policymakers are working to address.

The impact of the ongoing pandemic is felt across multiple facets of American life. The economy, still recovering from the initial shocks of 2020, faces continued uncertainty. Supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and inflation have been exacerbated by the pandemic's persistence. Businesses are struggling to adapt, with many opting for remote work as a long-term solution rather than a temporary fix.

Education systems face their own set of challenges. Schools across the nation are attempting to maintain in-person instruction, but outbreaks have led to periodic closures and a return to remote learning in some cases. Teachers and students alike are navigating a landscape of uncertainty, with the added stress of potential exposure hanging over every school day.

Mental health has also emerged as a significant concern. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that the pandemic has taken a toll on Americans' mental well-being, with increased reports of anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. Health care providers are urging people to seek help and support, highlighting the importance of mental health resources during these trying times.

Despite these challenges, there are glimmers of hope. The scientific community continues to make strides in understanding and combating the virus. Rapid testing has become more accessible, and public health messaging has evolved to emphasize the importance of hygiene, mask-wearing, and social distancing when appropriate.

Communities across the country are finding ways to adapt and support one another. Grassroots efforts have emerged to assist those in need, whether through food distribution programs, online support groups, or initiatives aimed at boosting vaccination rates.

As the nation moves forward, there is a growing recognition that living with COVID-19 requires a collective effort. ""We all have a role to play in keeping our communities safe,"" said Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC. ""It's about making informed choices and looking out for one another.""

In the meantime, public health officials remain vigilant, monitoring the virus's trajectory and adjusting strategies accordingly. The road ahead may be uncertain, but the resilience and adaptability of the American people offer a beacon of hope as the country navigates this new normal.

As winter approaches and indoor gatherings increase, the focus remains on mitigating the virus's impact while striving for a semblance of normalcy. The coming months will test the nation's resolve, but with continued vigilance and cooperation, there is optimism that brighter days lie ahead.",gpt
An Australian man dies in alleged ax attack near school after 'road rage' incident,"An Australian man has died following an alleged ax attack near a school in the Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, authorities reported on Thursday. The incident, which unfolded on Wednesday afternoon, is believed to have been sparked by a road rage altercation.

According to Victoria Police, the 39-year-old victim, whose identity has not yet been released, was involved in a minor traffic incident with another vehicle on the busy Ballarat Road. Witnesses report that the situation quickly escalated, culminating in a violent confrontation near a local primary school.

""Initial investigations suggest that the two drivers engaged in a verbal dispute after the traffic incident,"" stated Detective Inspector Jack Gale. ""The situation then tragically escalated, resulting in the alleged use of an ax on the victim.""

Emergency services were called to the scene shortly after 3:00 p.m., where they found the victim with critical injuries. Despite the efforts of paramedics, the man was pronounced dead at the scene. A 42-year-old male suspect, who police believe was the driver of the second vehicle, was arrested a short distance away and is currently in custody.

Authorities have yet to confirm if the suspect and victim knew each other prior to the incident. Detective Inspector Gale noted that while road rage incidents can sometimes involve individuals who are acquainted, there is currently no evidence to suggest a prior relationship in this case.

The alleged attack occurred in close proximity to a primary school, prompting a swift response from local law enforcement to ensure the safety of students and staff. The school was placed under temporary lockdown as a precaution, though police have since confirmed that no students were harmed or involved in the incident.

""We understand the distressing nature of this incident, especially given its proximity to a school,"" said Inspector Gale. ""We are conducting a thorough investigation and will provide updates as more information becomes available.""

Local residents have expressed shock and concern over the violent nature of the incident, with many questioning how a seemingly minor road disagreement could lead to such a tragic outcome. Helen Ward, a resident who witnessed the aftermath, described the scene as chaotic and distressing.

""I saw police cars and ambulances everywhere, and then I heard what had happened,"" Ward recounted. ""It's terrifying to think something like this could happen in broad daylight, right near where children are.""

The incident has prompted renewed calls from community leaders for increased measures to address road rage and violence in the area. Sunshine Mayor Linda Thompson extended her condolences to the victim's family and urged the community to remain calm as the investigation unfolds.

""This is a heartbreaking incident, and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased,"" Mayor Thompson said in a statement. ""We must work together to foster a safer environment on our roads and in our community.""

Victoria Police have urged any witnesses or individuals with dash-cam footage of the incident to come forward to assist with the investigation. They are particularly interested in hearing from anyone who may have seen the initial road altercation or the subsequent attack.

The suspect is expected to face charges relating to the incident, though formal charges have not yet been announced. He is set to appear in court later this week.

As the investigation continues, the Sunshine community remains on edge, grappling with the aftermath of an event that has not only claimed a life but also highlighted the potential for everyday interactions to spiral into violence. Authorities are hopeful that a thorough investigation will provide clarity and, ultimately, justice for the victim and his family.",gpt
The Plot Against AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs vision feels eerily familiar,"The HBO miniseries ""The Plot Against America"" has struck a chord with audiences across the nation, offering an unnervingly familiar vision that resonates with contemporary socio-political dynamics. Adapted from Philip Roth’s 2004 novel, the series presents an alternate history of the United States, where legendary aviator and staunch isolationist Charles Lindbergh defeats Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election, ushering in a wave of fascism and anti-Semitism across the country. 

Set in the 1940s, the narrative unfolds through the eyes of a working-class Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey, as they navigate the turbulent political landscape. The series captures the insidious rise of authoritarianism, the vulnerability of democratic institutions, and the societal fractures that emerge when fear and nationalism take precedence over unity and tolerance. 

Viewers have noted the eerie parallels between the show’s depiction of an America teetering on the brink of authoritarianism and current events. In recent years, the U.S. has witnessed a polarization of political discourse, concerns over electoral integrity, and an increase in racial and religious tensions. The show’s portrayal of a demagogue exploiting national fears and prejudices to gain power feels particularly relevant, echoing apprehensions about the fragility of democratic norms.

David Simon, the co-creator of the miniseries, aimed to capture the essence of Roth’s narrative, warning against complacency in the face of rising populism. ""The Plot Against America"" serves as a stark reminder of how quickly the political climate can shift and how fragile democratic institutions can be when confronted with charismatic leaders who offer simplistic solutions to complex problems. 

The show's relevance is further amplified by its exploration of media complicity and the dissemination of propaganda. In the series, radio broadcasts become a tool for spreading Lindbergh’s isolationist and xenophobic rhetoric, mirroring today’s concerns over misinformation and the role of media in shaping public perception. The historical backdrop of the series offers a lens through which viewers can examine modern challenges, including the influence of social media on political discourse and the spread of conspiracy theories.

Critics have praised the series for its nuanced portrayal of its characters, who embody the diverse reactions to the country’s political upheaval. Some characters embrace Lindbergh’s rhetoric, hoping for change and stability, while others resist, fearing the erosion of civil liberties and the rise of authoritarianism. This complexity adds depth to the narrative, reflecting the varied responses of individuals and communities when confronted with divisive leadership.

""The Plot Against America"" invites viewers to reflect on the lessons of history and their relevance to the present day. The series underscores the importance of vigilance and civic engagement in preserving democratic values and protecting marginalized communities from the dangers of scapegoating and bigotry. It challenges audiences to consider the consequences of political apathy and the responsibility of citizens to hold leaders accountable.

As the series concludes, it leaves viewers with a sobering reminder of the resilience required to safeguard democracy. In an era marked by political uncertainty and social unrest, ""The Plot Against America"" serves as both a cautionary tale and a call to action. Its chilling portrayal of an alternate reality that feels all too plausible encourages a critical examination of the current political landscape and a renewed commitment to the values of inclusivity and justice.

In the end, ""The Plot Against America"" is more than just a historical drama; it is a mirror reflecting the vulnerabilities and challenges of our time. By drawing on the past to illuminate the present, the series urges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths and to take an active role in shaping a future that upholds the principles of democracy and freedom.",gpt
90% of people are biased against women. That's the challenge we face,"A recent global study has found that an overwhelming 90% of people hold biases against women, revealing a significant challenge that societies worldwide continue to face in the pursuit of gender equality. The study, conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), examined attitudes across 75 countries, covering more than 80% of the world’s population.

The findings suggest that gender bias remains deeply embedded in societies, influencing perceptions and actions in various spheres, including politics, business, and social settings. The report highlights that these biases are not limited to any one region or culture but are pervasive across the globe.

Nahla Valji, UN Women’s Senior Gender Adviser, commented on the findings, stating, “Despite decades of progress towards gender equality, these numbers show that there is still a substantial amount of work to be done. Biases, whether conscious or unconscious, continue to shape the world in ways that disadvantage women.”

The study utilized a series of metrics to gauge gender bias, including perceptions of women in leadership roles, attitudes towards domestic responsibilities, and beliefs about gender equality in education and employment. It found that in many countries, a significant majority of people believe that men make better political leaders or business executives than women. Additionally, traditional gender roles are still widely upheld, with many respondents agreeing that men should have the final say in household decisions.

These biases have tangible effects on women’s participation in public life and the workforce. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, women, on average, earn just 68% of what men earn for similar work. Furthermore, women hold only 25% of parliamentary seats worldwide and occupy less than 21% of ministerial positions.

Experts suggest that these disparities are both a cause and a consequence of entrenched gender biases. Dr. Maria Sanchez, a sociologist specializing in gender studies, explained, “Biases against women perpetuate a cycle where women are less likely to be seen in leadership roles, which in turn reinforces stereotypes about their capabilities. Breaking this cycle requires systemic changes in how societies are structured and how leadership is conceived.”

Efforts to address these biases have been underway for years, with various organizations advocating for gender equality through education, policy changes, and awareness campaigns. However, the UNDP report underscores the need for more comprehensive and targeted approaches.

Governments and organizations are called upon to implement policies that promote gender equality in all sectors. This includes enforcing equal pay legislation, increasing women’s representation in leadership roles, and providing support for work-life balance through policies such as parental leave and childcare support.

Education is also highlighted as a crucial tool in combating gender bias. By integrating gender equality into educational curricula from a young age, societies can begin to dismantle stereotypes and cultivate a more inclusive mindset among future generations.

The private sector has a role to play as well. Companies are encouraged to conduct regular gender bias audits and implement training programs that address unconscious biases. Initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in hiring and career advancement can help create more equitable workplaces.

Despite the daunting statistics, there are signs of progress. In some countries, legislation promoting gender equality has led to a narrowing of the gender gap in education and employment. Social movements advocating for women’s rights continue to gain momentum, challenging traditional norms and advocating for systemic change.

As the world marks significant milestones such as International Women’s Day and the anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, there is an opportunity to reflect on the strides made and the work that remains. The UNDP report serves as a crucial reminder of the pervasive nature of gender bias and the collective effort required to overcome it.

In the words of Valji, “Achieving gender equality is not only a moral imperative but a critical component of achieving sustainable development. It’s time for all sectors of society to take bold steps to dismantle the biases that hold women back and create a world where everyone can thrive, regardless of gender.”",gpt
Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response,"The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was one of the deadliest in recent history, claiming over 11,000 lives and challenging global health systems. However, it also served as a crucial learning experience, offering valuable insights into managing epidemics effectively. As the world continues to grapple with various infectious diseases, understanding the lessons from the Ebola crisis has become more pertinent than ever.

One of the key takeaways from the Ebola outbreak is the importance of early detection and rapid response. Dr. Margaret Chan, the former Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized that delays in recognizing and responding to the initial cases in Guinea contributed to the rapid spread of the virus. The outbreak underscored the need for robust surveillance systems and the capacity to quickly identify and isolate cases to prevent widespread transmission.

Community engagement emerged as another critical component in the fight against Ebola. In many affected regions, mistrust of health authorities and misinformation about the virus hindered containment efforts. Successful interventions involved working closely with local leaders and communities to foster trust and ensure that public health messages were culturally appropriate and effectively communicated. This approach was vital in encouraging individuals to seek treatment and adhere to prevention measures.

International collaboration played a significant role in the eventual control of the Ebola outbreak. The crisis prompted unprecedented levels of cooperation between governments, non-governmental organizations, and international bodies. The deployment of resources, including medical personnel and supplies, was crucial in supporting overwhelmed local health systems. The establishment of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in 2014 marked the first time the UN created a mission specifically to tackle a public health emergency, highlighting the necessity of coordinated global action.

The development and deployment of effective treatments and vaccines were also pivotal in the Ebola response. While there was no licensed vaccine at the start of the outbreak, significant progress was made during its course. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, which underwent accelerated trials, demonstrated high efficacy in preventing infection and was used in a ""ring vaccination"" strategy to protect those at high risk. This experience has informed current strategies for vaccine development and deployment in response to other emerging infectious diseases.

Another essential lesson from the Ebola outbreak is the need to strengthen health systems in vulnerable regions. The epidemic exposed significant gaps in infrastructure, workforce, and resources in the affected countries, hampering their ability to respond effectively. Strengthening health systems, particularly in low-resource settings, is crucial for improving resilience against future epidemics. Investments in healthcare infrastructure, workforce training, and resource allocation have been identified as priority areas to enhance preparedness and response capabilities.

The Ebola outbreak also highlighted the importance of addressing the social and economic impacts of epidemics. The crisis had devastating effects on the economies of the affected countries, disrupting trade, agriculture, and livelihoods. Recognizing the broader impacts of health emergencies is essential for developing comprehensive response strategies that include measures to support economic recovery and social stability.

In conclusion, the Ebola outbreak provided critical lessons that have shaped current approaches to epidemic response. Early detection, community engagement, international cooperation, and the development of medical countermeasures were key factors in controlling the crisis. Strengthening health systems and addressing the socio-economic impacts of epidemics are also vital components of an effective response. As global health threats continue to evolve, these lessons remain crucial for safeguarding public health and preventing future outbreaks from becoming global crises.",gpt

The fast-food giant is venturing into the home fragrance market with a series of candles designed to evoke the aroma of individual ingredients found in its popular Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

The collection, aptly named the ""Quarter Pounder Scented Candle Pack,"" comprises six distinct candles, each representing a different component of the beloved burger.

""We know our fans' love for the Quarter Pounder runs deep,"" said McDonald's Chief Marketing Officer, Morgan Flatley. ""With the Quarter Pounder Scented Candle Pack, we aim to bring a piece of the McDonald's experience into homes in a unique and memorable way.""

This latest venture into lifestyle products comes as McDonald's continues to explore ways to engage with its audience beyond the traditional dining experience. The scented candles were first introduced as part of a promotional campaign by the Quarter Pounder Fan Club, an initiative launched to celebrate the burger's loyal fan base.

""I can't wait to fill my living room with the smell of a fresh Quarter Pounder!"" tweeted one enthusiastic fan. Others have praised the creativity behind the concept, noting that it adds an element of fun and nostalgia to home decor.

However, not all responses have been favorable. Some consumers have questioned the practicality and appeal of burger-scented candles. Critics have pointed out that while the scents may evoke fond memories of dining at McDonald's, they might not be suited for every home environment. ""As much as I love a good burger, I'm not sure I want my house smelling like one all the time,"" commented a skeptic on a popular online forum.

Despite the mixed reactions, McDonald's appears confident in the candles' potential, highlighting the growing trend of branded lifestyle products that allow consumers to connect with their favorite brands in new ways. Products like the Quarter Pounder Scented Candle Pack align with the company's broader strategy to innovate and diversify its offerings while maintaining a strong connection to its core menu items.

The candles will be sold as a set, allowing customers to enjoy the full symphony of scents that make up the Quarter Pounder experience. McDonald's has not yet specified a release date, but the candles are expected to be available for purchase through the company's online store in the coming months. Pricing details have also not been disclosed, though industry experts speculate that the set will be competitively priced to attract a wide range of consumers.

As McDonald's prepares to roll out this aromatic offering, industry analysts will be watching closely to see how it resonates with the public. The success of the Quarter Pounder Scented Candle Pack could pave the way for future collaborations and product launches, potentially setting a precedent for other fast-food chains to explore similar ventures.

In the meantime, fans of the Quarter Pounder can look forward to an immersive sensory experience, one that promises to transform any room into a nostalgic tribute to one of McDonald's most enduring menu items. Whether greeted with excitement or skepticism, the Quarter Pounder Scented Candle Pack is poised to make a notable mark in the world of branded consumer goods.",gpt
What the 'Friends' reunion makes me hope for,"The long-awaited ""Friends"" reunion aired on May 27, 2021, rekindling the nostalgia of millions worldwide who cherished the iconic sitcom during its original run from 1994 to 2004. Fans had eagerly anticipated the cast's return to the screen, and the special did not disappoint. However, beyond the laughter and tears, the reunion left many pondering what the show's revival could mean for the future of television and pop culture.

The reunion brought together the original cast—Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer—on the beloved set that served as the backdrop for countless memorable moments. The special was a mix of nostalgia-driven segments, table reads of fan-favorite scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and heartfelt discussions among the cast and creators. It was a chance for fans to relive the magic of ""Friends"" while also gaining insight into its enduring legacy.

One of the most striking aspects of the reunion was the chemistry among the cast members. Despite the years apart, their camaraderie was palpable, reminding viewers why ""Friends"" resonated with audiences in the first place. This connection between the actors translated into the authentic friendships that defined the show, making fans hope for more revivals that focus on genuine relationships rather than forced narratives.

Moreover, the special highlighted the timeless appeal of ""Friends."" Its humor, relatability, and themes of friendship and personal growth continue to resonate with new generations. As the entertainment industry evolves, there is a growing desire for content that transcends time, offering comfort and familiarity in an ever-changing world. The success of the reunion could pave the way for more content that bridges the gap between past and present, appealing to both long-time fans and new audiences.

The reunion also underscored the importance of diversity and representation in television. While ""Friends"" was a groundbreaking show in many ways, it has faced criticism for its lack of diversity. The special acknowledged these shortcomings, and the cast and creators expressed their hopes for more inclusive storytelling in the future. This acknowledgment serves as a reminder that while nostalgia can be powerful, it must also be accompanied by progress and evolution.

In addition to celebrating the past, the reunion sparked discussions about the potential for future projects featuring the original cast. While the actors have repeatedly stated that a scripted revival is unlikely, their collective enthusiasm for the reunion suggests that fans may not have seen the last of the ""Friends"" universe. Whether through new projects that capture the spirit of the original or through appearances in similar ensemble formats, the reunion has opened the door for more collaborative ventures.

The success of the ""Friends"" reunion also raises questions about the future of television reunions in general. As streaming platforms continue to grow, there is increasing potential for beloved shows to find new life through similar specials. The reunion demonstrated that there is a significant audience for well-crafted, nostalgia-driven content that honors the past while also celebrating the present. It sets a precedent for how networks and streaming services might approach revivals, balancing fan service with genuine storytelling.

Ultimately, the ""Friends"" reunion was more than just a trip down memory lane. It was a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the impact of genuine relationships on and off screen.

Together we make a family,"In a world where traditional family structures have long dominated societal norms, a growing movement is reshaping the definition of what it means to be a family. The phrase ""Together we make a family"" has become a rallying cry for those who have forged familial bonds outside conventional frameworks, emphasizing that love and commitment, rather than genetic ties, are the true foundations of family life.

Across the globe, diverse family configurations are gaining recognition and acceptance, from single-parent households and blended families to cohabitating friends and multigenerational living arrangements. This shift reflects broader societal changes, including increasing acceptance of LGBTQ+ relationships, evolving gender roles, and a greater focus on personal choice in defining family dynamics.

For many, forming a family is no longer strictly about biological lineage or legal paperwork. Jessica and Maria, a couple in their mid-thirties from Austin, Texas, exemplify this trend. Together for eight years, they have built a family of their own by adopting two children and fostering several others. ""For us, family is about love, support, and being there for one another,"" says Maria. ""Our kids may not share our DNA, but they are as much our family as anyone could be.""

This evolving concept of family has been aided by advances in reproductive technologies and shifting legal landscapes. In many countries, same-sex couples can now marry and adopt children, while surrogacy and in vitro fertilization offer new paths to parenthood. These developments have expanded the possibilities for creating families that reflect the values and identities of their members.

The impact of these changes extends beyond individual households. Sociologists note that as the definition of family broadens, so too does the understanding of community. Dr. Linda Harper, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, explains, ""When we talk about family today, we're often talking about networks of care and support that can include friends, neighbors, and even coworkers. Family is increasingly seen as a chosen group of people who provide emotional and practical support.""

This view is echoed by families like the Johnsons, a blended family in Los Angeles. After both experiencing divorces, Aaron and Lisa Johnson met and married, bringing together their children from previous relationships. ""We've had our challenges, but the kids have learned that family is about supporting each other, no matter what,"" Aaron shares. ""It's not always easy, but we make it work. Together, we make a family.""

Despite these positive developments, challenges remain. Many non-traditional families still face legal and societal hurdles, from discriminatory policies to biased perceptions. For example, unmarried couples in some regions struggle with legal recognition, affecting issues like inheritance and parental rights. Additionally, stigma can persist for families that deviate from the ""nuclear"" model.

Organizations advocating for family diversity emphasize the importance of policy reforms that acknowledge and support all family types. This includes legal recognition of various family structures, access to family benefits, and protection against discrimination. ""Every family deserves the same rights and respect, regardless of how it's formed,"" argues Carla Nguyen, director of the Family Diversity Coalition. ""Policies need to reflect the realities of today's families.""

Education also plays a crucial role in fostering acceptance. Schools and community programs that celebrate diverse family structures can help dispel myths and reduce stigma. Initiatives that encourage children to share stories about their families, for instance, can promote understanding and empathy among peers.

As society continues to evolve, the concept of family will likely become even more inclusive. Surveys indicate a growing acceptance of diverse family structures among younger generations, suggesting that the trend will continue to gain momentum. This shift is not only reshaping the notion of family but also redefining what it means to be part of a community.

Ultimately, the message is clear: family is not dictated by blood or paperwork but by the love and commitment people have for one another. As more individuals embrace this inclusive definition, the phrase ""Together we make a family"" will continue to resonate, inspiring countless others to forge their own unique paths to belonging and togetherness.",gpt
"Son accused of stabbing mother to death, man shot and killed in back-to-back Tacoma homicides","In a tragic and shocking series of events, two separate homicides occurred in Tacoma, Washington, within a span of just a few hours, leaving the community reeling and law enforcement officials working tirelessly to piece together the details.

The first incident involved a domestic dispute that escalated into a fatality. According to the Tacoma Police Department, officers responded to a distress call from a residence in the North End neighborhood late Sunday evening. Upon arrival, they discovered the body of 56-year-old Martha Jenkins, who had been fatally stabbed multiple times. Her 24-year-old son, identified as Michael Jenkins, has been taken into custody and is being held as the primary suspect in the case.

Police spokesperson Officer Lucy Hernandez stated that initial reports suggest an argument between the mother and son took a violent turn, leading to the tragic outcome. ""This is a heartbreaking situation for the family and the community,"" Hernandez said. ""Our investigators are thoroughly reviewing the evidence to understand the circumstances that led to this horrific act.""

Neighbors expressed shock and disbelief upon hearing the news. ""Martha was a kind woman, always looking out for everyone,"" said Sarah Collins, a neighbor and friend of the victim. ""It's hard to believe something like this could happen right next door.""

While authorities were still on the scene of the first incident, reports of a second homicide came in from the city's South End. This time, the victim was a 32-year-old man who was shot and killed outside a convenience store. Witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and seeing a suspect flee the scene in a dark-colored vehicle.

The victim, whose identity has not yet been publicly released pending notification of next of kin, was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency medical responders. Detectives are currently reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses in an effort to identify the perpetrator and understand the motive behind the shooting.

The two incidents do not appear to be connected, according to police officials. However, the back-to-back nature of the homicides has left residents concerned about the safety of their neighborhoods. ""It's alarming to hear about two such violent incidents happening so close together,"" said Tacoma resident John Martinez. ""We hope the police can bring those responsible to justice soon.""

Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards addressed the community's concerns during a press conference on Monday morning, emphasizing the city's commitment to tackling violent crime. ""We are deeply saddened by these senseless acts of violence,"" she said. ""Our thoughts are with the families affected, and we assure the community that our law enforcement agencies are doing everything possible to ensure their safety.""

The Tacoma Police Department is urging anyone with information related to either incident to contact their tip line. ""Community involvement is crucial in solving these cases,"" Officer Hernandez stressed. ""We encourage anyone who might have seen or heard something to reach out, no matter how insignificant it may seem.""

As the investigation continues, both incidents have reignited discussions around crime and safety measures in Tacoma. Local advocacy groups are calling for increased community policing efforts and more resources for mental health support, particularly in light of the domestic nature of the first homicide.

The city has seen a rise in violent crime rates over the past few years, prompting law enforcement and community leaders to explore new strategies for crime prevention and intervention. These recent homicides underscore the ongoing challenges faced by the city in addressing complex social issues that contribute to violence.

As Tacoma grapples with the aftermath of these tragic events, the community remains hopeful for swift justice and a renewed focus on safety and support for all residents.",gpt
"It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President","In recent months, there has been a growing chorus of voices urging President [Last Name] to rely more heavily on the expertise of seasoned professionals within his administration. As the nation grapples with a multitude of complex challenges, from economic fluctuations to pressing international issues, the call for the President to defer to the wisdom of experts has never been more urgent.

The United States is seeing a resurgence of debates on the role of expert opinion in policymaking, a discourse that has been persistent throughout various administrations. Historically, presidents have relied on a cadre of advisors and subject matter experts to guide decision-making processes. However, recent actions have raised concerns about the extent to which expert advice is being prioritized.

Economically, the country is navigating a precarious recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. Inflation rates are fluctuating, and the labor market is experiencing shifts with significant implications for both workers and employers. Economists within the federal government, as well as those in academia, have been advocating for specific measures to stabilize the economy. These include targeted fiscal policies and adjustments in interest rates to curb inflation without stifling growth. Yet, there is a perception among some experts that their recommendations are not being adequately heeded.

Dr. Emily Carter, a renowned economist at the National Economic Council, expressed her concerns, stating, ""While the administration has taken some steps in the right direction, there needs to be a more systematic approach informed by economic data and models. Quick fixes rarely address the underlying issues.""

On the international front, foreign policy experts are urging the administration to adopt strategies that align with global diplomatic norms while addressing emerging threats. The complexities of geopolitics require nuanced understanding and strategic foresight, areas where seasoned diplomats and international relations scholars play a crucial role. Recent tensions in Eastern Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have underscored the need for a balanced approach that leverages both hard and soft power.

Ambassador James Lee, a former diplomat and current analyst at the International Policy Institute, remarked, ""Diplomatic solutions are often delicate and require a deep understanding of the historical context and current dynamics. It is vital that the administration listens to those who have spent their careers navigating these intricacies.""

Domestically, the administration’s handling of healthcare policy remains a hotly debated issue. The ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside other public health concerns, highlight the necessity of relying on scientific expertise. Public health officials have been advocating for evidence-based measures to manage and prevent potential health crises. However, the mixed messaging from political leaders has, at times, undermined public confidence.

Dr. Alan Michaels, a prominent epidemiologist, emphasized the importance of clear, consistent communication grounded in scientific evidence. ""Public trust is essential in any public health initiative. The administration must ensure that expert voices are at the forefront of policy announcements to maintain credibility,"" he said.

While the President’s intentions to address these multifaceted issues are evident, the effectiveness of such efforts may hinge on the administration’s willingness to empower experts. Balancing political considerations with expert advice is undoubtedly challenging, but history has shown that the latter often provides the most reliable foundation for sound policy decisions.

Critics of the administration argue that the politicization of expert input can lead to short-term gains at the expense of long-term solutions. The administration, they contend, must prioritize transparency and accountability by visibly incorporating expert advice into its decision-making processes.

In response to these concerns, the White House has reiterated its commitment to engaging with experts across various fields. A spokesperson stated, ""President [Last Name] values the insights and recommendations of the experts within his administration and is committed to making informed decisions that best serve the American people.""

As the nation moves forward, the interplay between expertise and governance will remain a focal point of public discourse. The challenges facing the country are vast and complex, and the need for informed, expert-driven solutions has never been greater. Whether the administration will heed the call to let experts do their jobs remains to be seen, but the stakes are undeniably high.

In these times of uncertainty, the role of experts is not merely advisory but essential. It is, as many argue, time for their voices to be at the forefront, guiding the nation through its challenges with informed precision and clarity.",gpt
"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","Amid rising concerns over a surge in COVID-19 cases, New York City faces mounting pressure to close its public school system, the largest in the United States. With over a million students enrolled across more than 1,800 schools, any decision to shutter institutions could have far-reaching implications for education, family routines, and the city’s economy.

The current wave of infections has reignited debates among city officials, parents, and educators regarding the safety of keeping schools open. Mayor Eric Adams, who has prioritized maintaining in-person learning, is now confronted with the daunting challenge of balancing public health considerations with educational needs.

City health data indicates a significant uptick in COVID-19 cases, driven largely by newer, highly transmissible variants of the virus. Hospitalizations have also seen a steady rise, intensifying the debate over school closures. Concerns are particularly acute in neighborhoods where vaccination rates remain below average, sparking fears that schools could become hotspots for virus transmission.

Parents and educators are divided on the best course of action. Many parents are advocating for a temporary shift to remote learning, arguing that the health risks outweigh the benefits of in-person education during a surge. ""We understand the value of in-person learning, but health and safety should come first,"" said Maria Gonzalez, a mother of three in the Bronx. ""We need to ensure our children and educators are safe.""

Conversely, some parents, especially those of younger children, emphasize the challenges of remote learning, citing the academic and social setbacks their children experienced during previous school closures. ""My son struggled with remote learning,"" said David Kim, a Brooklyn parent. ""He needs the structure and support of being in school.""

Educators, too, are voicing concerns. The United Federation of Teachers (UFT), representing over 120,000 educators in the city, has called for stricter safety protocols. UFT President Michael Mulgrew stated, ""While we understand the desire to keep schools open, we must ensure the safety of our students and staff. We need clear plans to address rising cases and protect our communities.""

Mayor Adams and Schools Chancellor Meisha Porter have reiterated their commitment to maintaining safe, open schools. At a recent press conference, Adams noted, ""We are closely monitoring the situation and working with health experts to ensure we are making informed decisions. Our goal is to keep schools open, but not at the expense of public health.""

City officials have implemented several measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread within schools. These include mandatory mask-wearing, regular testing, and improved ventilation systems. Additionally, the city has ramped up vaccination efforts, promoting booster shots for eligible students and staff.

Despite these efforts, the call for closure remains persistent. Some city council members have joined the chorus, urging the administration to take decisive action to prevent further outbreaks. Councilwoman Jessica Ramos stated, ""We need to act swiftly to protect our communities. Temporary closures could help control the spread and prevent long-term disruptions.""

The potential economic impact of school closures is another significant concern. Many families rely on schools not only for education but also for childcare, enabling parents to work. Businesses, already grappling with pandemic-related challenges, fear that school closures could exacerbate staffing shortages.

As the situation unfolds, New York City is at a critical juncture. The decision to close or keep open the nation’s largest school system will serve as a bellwether for other cities grappling with similar dilemmas. With public health data evolving rapidly, city leaders face the daunting task of making decisions that will impact millions of lives.

The coming weeks will likely be pivotal in determining the trajectory of New York City's educational landscape amidst the pandemic. Parents, educators, and city officials will continue to weigh the complex interplay of health, education, and economic factors as they navigate this challenging period.",gpt
My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"In reflecting on my argument with Justice Antonin Scalia, it's important to first acknowledge the legacy he left behind. Scalia, known for his sharp wit and unwavering originalist philosophy, was a towering figure on the U.S. Supreme Court bench. His decisions and dissents often sparked vigorous debate, and my encounter with him was no exception.

The setting was a legal symposium several years ago, where Justice Scalia was the keynote speaker. The room buzzed with anticipation, packed with legal scholars, students, and practitioners eager to hear the Justice's views on constitutional interpretation. I was seated in the front row, representing a major news outlet, ready to capture his insights.

Scalia began his address with characteristic vigor, expounding on his belief in originalism — the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as it was understood at the time it was written. He argued that this approach provides a stable and predictable legal framework that guards against the whims of contemporary societal changes.

During the Q&A session, I raised my hand to pose a question that had been simmering in my mind. ""Justice Scalia,"" I began, ""how do you reconcile the need for a stable legal framework with the evolving nature of societal values, particularly in areas where the original text of the Constitution is silent or ambiguous?""

Scalia, with a twinkle in his eye, leaned forward as if relishing the opportunity for a spirited debate. ""Ah, the old 'living Constitution' argument,"" he replied, his voice a mix of amusement and challenge. ""The Constitution is not meant to be a chameleon, changing with every societal shift. It is meant to be interpreted as it was intended, not as we wish it to be now.""

I pressed further, citing examples such as the evolution of civil rights and technology, where the framers could not have foreseen the complexities of modern society. ""Doesn't the adaptability of the Constitution ensure its relevance?"" I asked.

Scalia responded with an analogy that he often used: ""The Constitution is like a legal anchor. It is not meant to drift with the tides but to hold firm. When changes are needed, that's what the amendment process is for. It is not the role of judges to amend from the bench.""

The exchange sparked a lively discussion in the room, with several attendees nodding in agreement while others whispered their dissent. Scalia's steadfast commitment to originalism was clear, as was his disdain for judicial activism, which he viewed as a dangerous deviation from democratic principles.

Yet, my argument with Scalia was not just about differing legal philosophies; it was about the broader implications of his views on contemporary society. I pointed out that the amendment process is notoriously difficult, often leaving critical issues in limbo. ""Doesn't this rigidity risk leaving important rights unprotected?"" I inquired.

Scalia countered with a historical perspective, noting that the framers intentionally created a challenging amendment process to ensure only the most essential changes were enacted. ""The difficulty is a feature, not a bug,"" he asserted.

Our debate, though respectful, highlighted the deep philosophical divide that characterizes much of the discourse around constitutional interpretation. Scalia's adherence to originalism, while praised for its clarity and consistency, also faced criticism for being inflexible in the face of modern challenges.

As the session concluded, Scalia graciously shook my hand, acknowledging the importance of such debates in a healthy democracy. ""We may not agree,"" he said with a smile, ""but it's through these discussions that we refine our understanding of the law.""

Reflecting on that encounter, I recognize the enduring impact of Justice Scalia's judicial philosophy. His arguments continue to resonate in legal circles, serving as a touchstone for debates on constitutional interpretation. While I remain skeptical of originalism's ability to fully address the complexities of modern society, I appreciate the rigorous intellectual framework it provides.

Ultimately, my argument with Justice Scalia underscored the ongoing tension between tradition and progress in American law. It is a dialogue that will undoubtedly continue, shaping the future of legal interpretation and the very fabric of American democracy.",gpt
How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution,"In the early 1960s, the United States was in the throes of a fervent space race with the Soviet Union. The launch of the Apollo program in 1961 marked a pivotal moment not just for space exploration, but also for technological innovation. While the program’s primary goal was to land humans on the Moon and return them safely to Earth, its legacy extends far beyond lunar exploration. The technological advancements and collaborative environment fostered by the Apollo program laid the groundwork for what would later become Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the tech revolution.

The Apollo program was a monumental undertaking that required unprecedented levels of innovation and collaboration between government agencies, private contractors, and academic institutions. At the heart of this endeavor was the demand for cutting-edge technology. Meeting the challenges of space travel necessitated advancements in computing, materials science, and telecommunications. These advancements were not only groundbreaking in their own right but also served as a catalyst for the burgeoning tech industry in Northern California.

One of the most significant contributions of the Apollo program to the tech industry was in the field of computing. The development of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) pushed the boundaries of what was technologically possible at the time. The AGC was one of the first computers to use integrated circuits, a technology that would later become the foundation of modern computing. The need for smaller, more efficient, and reliable computing systems for space missions drove innovation and investment in semiconductor technologies. This technological drive was a critical factor in transforming the Santa Clara Valley, which had been primarily focused on agriculture, into a hub for electronic and computer industries.

Moreover, the Apollo program fostered a spirit of collaboration and innovation that became a hallmark of Silicon Valley. The program brought together some of the brightest minds from academia and industry, creating a network of talent and knowledge that persisted long after the program ended. Companies that were involved in the program, such as Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, took the lessons learned and applied them to civilian technology, leading to the proliferation of personal computing and the internet age.

The influence of the Apollo program extended to the culture and business practices that characterize Silicon Valley today. The program’s emphasis on problem-solving, rapid prototyping, and iterative design became integral to the way tech companies operate. This approach encouraged risk-taking and innovation, elements that are crucial to the rapid development cycles and competitive nature of the tech industry.

Furthermore, the influx of federal funding for research and development during the Apollo era laid down infrastructure and resources that would benefit tech startups in the years to follow. Universities such as Stanford and MIT, which played significant roles in the Apollo missions, became breeding grounds for future tech entrepreneurs and innovators. This created a pipeline of talent and ideas that continued to fuel growth in the region.

The technological demands of the Apollo program also had a lasting impact on telecommunications and the development of digital networks. The need for reliable communication between Earth and space accelerated advancements in satellite and communication technology. These advancements laid the groundwork for the development of global communications networks, influencing everything from the internet to mobile technology.

In retrospect, the Apollo program’s contributions to technology and industry were as significant as its accomplishments in space exploration. The program not only inspired a generation to look toward the stars but also enabled countless innovations that would transform everyday life on Earth. The legacy of the Apollo program is evident in the rapid technological growth and entrepreneurial spirit that defines Silicon Valley today.

As we look towards future space endeavors, such as NASA’s Artemis program, the lessons and innovations of the Apollo era continue to resonate. The collaborative spirit, technological advancements, and visionary thinking that characterized the Apollo program remain integral to the ongoing evolution of the tech industry, reminding us that sometimes, reaching for the stars can change life on Earth in ways we never imagined.",gpt
"I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me","As millions of Americans grapple with chronic illnesses, the call for legislative action to enhance protections and support for this vulnerable population has reached a critical juncture. A significant portion of the U.S. population lives with chronic conditions, encompassing ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and mental health issues. For these individuals, navigating daily life presents unique challenges, compounded by the financial and bureaucratic hurdles of the existing healthcare system. Thus, it is imperative for Congress to implement measures that safeguard the health and well-being of the chronically ill.

One of the foremost priorities is the expansion and protection of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA has been a lifeline for many with pre-existing conditions, ensuring access to insurance without fear of denial or exorbitant premiums. However, recent political debates have put its future in jeopardy. Congress must not only preserve these protections but also consider enhancements that ensure comprehensive coverage remains accessible and affordable. Strengthening the ACA could include increasing subsidies for low-income individuals, expanding Medicaid in states that have yet to do so, and implementing measures to control prescription drug prices.

Another critical area is prescription drug reform. Many individuals with chronic illnesses rely on medications that are both life-saving and financially burdensome. The inflated cost of prescription drugs in the United States has been a point of contention for years, with patients often forced to choose between medication and other essentials. Legislative actions, such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies, could significantly reduce costs for patients. Additionally, introducing caps on out-of-pocket expenses for medications can alleviate financial strain on families dealing with chronic health conditions.

Furthermore, there is a pressing need for improved long-term care options. Chronic illnesses often require ongoing medical attention and support services, which can be inadequately covered by traditional insurance plans. Congress can address these gaps by expanding Medicare and Medicaid coverage for home-based and community health services. By investing in a robust infrastructure for long-term care, lawmakers can ensure that individuals with chronic illnesses receive the support they need without resorting to institutionalization, which can be both costly and undesirable for many patients.

Mental health care is another domain where legislative action is crucial. Chronic illness frequently accompanies mental health challenges, whether as a direct result of the illness or due to the stress and anxiety associated with managing it. Congress should advocate for parity in mental health coverage, ensuring it is treated with the same importance as physical health. This includes expanding access to mental health services, increasing funding for mental health programs, and integrating mental health care into primary care settings.

Additionally, workplace protections for individuals with chronic illnesses must be strengthened. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides some protection, but gaps remain, particularly concerning workplace accommodations and discrimination. Congress can enhance these protections by refining ADA guidelines to better address the needs of those with chronic conditions, offering tax incentives to businesses that implement inclusive practices, and instituting stricter penalties for non-compliance.

Lastly, it is essential for Congress to invest in research and innovation focused on chronic illnesses. This includes funding for medical research to better understand these conditions and develop new treatments. Encouraging public-private partnerships can accelerate the discovery and implementation of innovative solutions, ultimately improving the quality of life for those affected.

The path forward requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the multifaceted challenges faced by individuals with chronic illnesses. By prioritizing healthcare reform, prescription drug affordability, long-term care, mental health services, workplace protections, and research funding, Congress has the opportunity to enact meaningful change that will significantly impact millions of lives. In doing so, lawmakers not only fulfill a moral obligation but also invest in the overall health and productivity of the nation. The time for action is now, and the chronically ill community is counting on Congress to act decisively.",gpt
South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation,"As the coronavirus outbreak continues to escalate in Wuhan, China, South African citizens trapped in the epicenter are urgently calling on their government for evacuation. With the city's lockdown entering its fourth week, anxiety and frustration are mounting among the South African nationals who find themselves confined to their residences with dwindling supplies and growing uncertainty.

Wuhan, a sprawling city of 11 million people, has been sealed off by Chinese authorities since mid-January in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19. The unprecedented quarantine measures have left many foreign nationals stranded, prompting several countries to evacuate their citizens. However, South Africans in Wuhan say they feel forgotten as they await assistance from their government.

In a series of interviews conducted via phone and video calls, several South Africans described the challenges they face in Wuhan. ""We are scared and we want to come home,"" said Thandi Mkhize, a postgraduate student at Wuhan University. ""Our families are worried, and we are living in fear of contracting the virus.""

Mkhize, like many of her compatriots, expressed concerns about the limited access to basic necessities. ""It's becoming difficult to find food and other supplies. Most stores are closed, and the ones that are open have long lines and shortages,"" she added.

The South African government has been criticized for its perceived slow response to the crisis. While countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have already repatriated their citizens, South Africa has yet to announce any concrete evacuation plans. This has left many of the approximately 100 South Africans in Wuhan feeling anxious and uncertain about their future.

In response to the growing outcry, South Africa's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, addressed the issue in a press briefing earlier this week. ""We are acutely aware of the situation our citizens are facing in Wuhan, and we are working closely with Chinese authorities to ensure their safety and well-being,"" she assured. ""Evacuation plans are under consideration, and we are exploring all possible options to bring our people home safely.""

Pandor noted that the South African embassy in Beijing has been in constant communication with the citizens in Wuhan, providing regular updates and support. However, she acknowledged the challenges involved in coordinating an evacuation, particularly given the logistical complexities and the need to adhere to international health regulations.

Meanwhile, back home in South Africa, family members of those stranded in Wuhan have been vocal in their calls for action. ""We are worried sick,"" said Sipho Dlamini, whose daughter is studying in Wuhan. ""We just want our children to come back safely. The government needs to act fast.""

The situation in Wuhan remains dire, with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continuing to rise. As of the latest reports, the virus has claimed over 2,000 lives worldwide, with the majority of fatalities occurring in China. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, urging countries to take proactive measures to prevent further spread.

For the South Africans in Wuhan, the wait for evacuation is fraught with uncertainty. Many have taken to social media to share their experiences and appeal for help, using hashtags like #EvacuateSACitizens and #BringUsHome.

While the government navigates the intricate process of organizing an evacuation, those stranded in Wuhan can only hope for a swift resolution. ""We just want to come home,"" said Mkhize, echoing the sentiments of many of her fellow citizens. ""We need the support and action of our government more than ever.""

As the situation unfolds, the South African government faces mounting pressure to expedite its response and ensure the safe return of its citizens. The coming days will be crucial in determining the outcome for those caught in the grip of the Wuhan lockdown.",gpt
Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Wall Street experienced a notable rebound on Tuesday following a historic plunge earlier in the week, offering a glimmer of hope to investors who have been navigating a volatile economic landscape. Tuesday’s rally, led by a surge in tech stocks, helped to alleviate some of the anxiety sparked by Monday’s dramatic sell-off, which marked one of the most significant single-day losses in recent memory.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.5%, adding approximately 750 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite each rose by 2.8% and 3.2%, respectively. This upswing comes as investors digest new data suggesting potential resilience in certain sectors of the economy, despite ongoing concerns about inflation and global supply chain disruptions.

Tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, were among the top gainers, each posting increases of more than 3%. The tech sector, which has been under pressure due to rising bond yields, saw a resurgence as investors took advantage of lower valuations following Monday’s steep declines. Analysts suggest this rally may signal renewed confidence in the long-term growth prospects of technology companies, which have been pivotal in driving market gains over the past decade.

Financial stocks also contributed to the upswing. Major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs recorded gains of approximately 2%, buoyed by expectations of interest rate hikes which could enhance profit margins. Energy stocks, however, had a mixed performance as oil prices fluctuated amid concerns over OPEC’s production levels and geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains.

Tuesday’s market activity comes on the heels of a turbulent period marked by heightened volatility. Monday’s plunge was largely attributed to fears surrounding inflationary pressures, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicating a higher-than-expected rise in prices, stoking fears of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. Investors have been skittish as they assess how quickly the Fed might raise interest rates to curb inflation, with some analysts predicting multiple rate hikes in the coming year.

“The market’s rebound today suggests that there is still underlying confidence, but it remains fragile,” said Laura McMillan, a senior market strategist at Horizon Investments. “Investors are clearly trying to balance optimism about economic growth with the reality of persistent inflationary pressures.”

In an effort to provide more clarity, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, reiterating the Fed’s commitment to maintaining price stability while supporting continued economic recovery. Powell emphasized the importance of flexible policy-making, suggesting that the central bank would be prepared to adjust its approach as necessary to respond to evolving economic conditions.

Meanwhile, global markets mirrored Wall Street’s fluctuations, with European stocks closing higher after initial losses, while Asian markets showed mixed results overnight. The MSCI World Index, a broad gauge of global equity markets, rose 1.9%, reflecting cautious optimism among international investors.

Market participants continue to monitor several key economic indicators due later this week, including the Producer Price Index (PPI) and retail sales data, which are expected to provide further insights into consumer demand and wholesale pricing trends. Analysts caution that any surprises in these reports could spark additional volatility, underscoring the market’s sensitivity to economic data amid an uncertain global backdrop.

As investors navigate these choppy waters, many are adjusting their portfolios to hedge against potential risks, with some increasing their allocation to defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples. Others are diversifying into commodities and real estate, seeking safe havens amidst economic uncertainty.

For now, Wall Street’s rebound offers a momentary reprieve, but market watchers remain vigilant. The interplay of inflation, interest rates, and global economic dynamics will likely continue to shape market sentiment in the weeks and months ahead, as investors search for direction in a rapidly changing financial landscape.",gpt
Asking yourself 'What's the meaning of life?' may extend it,"In a groundbreaking study that resonates with age-old philosophical inquiries, researchers have found that pondering the question “What’s the meaning of life?” could not only enrich one’s existence but potentially extend it. The findings, published in the Journal of Psychological Well-being, suggest that engaging in regular contemplation about life's purpose may promote longevity and improve overall health.

The research, conducted over a decade, involved more than 3,000 participants from diverse backgrounds and varying age groups. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, spearheaded the study, aiming to investigate the long-held belief that a purposeful life correlates with better health outcomes. Their results indicate a strong link between existential reflection and enhanced mental and physical well-being.

Dr. Emily Tran, the study’s lead author and a professor of psychology, explained the methodology: “We asked participants to engage in daily reflections focused on life’s meaning and purpose. Through a series of surveys and health assessments conducted over ten years, we observed that those who regularly engaged in such reflections reported higher levels of life satisfaction and exhibited lower rates of chronic illnesses.”

The participants who frequently contemplated their purpose demonstrated a 15% lower risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and showed improved immune function compared to those who did not engage in such reflections. Additionally, these individuals reported fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, conditions often linked with stress and a lack of purpose.

Dr. Tran attributes these findings to the psychological benefits of having a clear sense of purpose. “When individuals have a defined understanding of what gives their life meaning, they tend to experience less stress and anxiety. This mindset can lead to healthier lifestyle choices and better stress management, which are crucial for longevity,” she said.

The implications of this research extend beyond individual health benefits. Dr. Tran noted that fostering environments where people are encouraged to explore and define their purpose could have positive societal impacts. “Communities that support existential reflection may see overall improvements in public health and well-being,” she added.

While the study emphasizes the health advantages of pondering life’s meaning, it also raises questions about how modern society approaches existential questions. In an era dominated by rapid technological advancements and fast-paced lifestyles, many individuals may find themselves disconnected from deeper philosophical inquiries.

Dr. Sarah Patel, a sociologist not affiliated with the study, commented on the societal implications: “In today’s world, people often prioritize productivity and material success over introspection. This research suggests that integrating moments of reflection into our daily routines could be beneficial not just for personal health but for societal well-being as well.”

The study’s findings have already prompted interest from the wellness industry, with some organizations exploring ways to incorporate existential reflection into their health and wellness programs. Mindfulness and meditation apps are considering updates to encourage users to engage in purposeful reflection, potentially adding features that prompt users to explore questions about life’s meaning.

However, experts caution against oversimplifying the study’s findings. Dr. Tran emphasized that while reflecting on life’s meaning can contribute to well-being, it is not a panacea for all health issues. “It’s important to view this as one component of a holistic approach to health. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and social connections also play significant roles in determining longevity,” she noted.

The research opens new avenues for further exploration, with scientists interested in examining how cultural, religious, and philosophical differences influence individuals’ perceptions of life’s meaning. Future studies may also investigate the role of digital technology in either facilitating or hindering existential reflection.

As the debate around the meaning of life continues to capture human curiosity, this study offers a compelling argument for the practical benefits of engaging with such questions. As Dr. Tran concludes, “While we may never find a definitive answer to life’s meaning, the journey of exploration itself appears to be a vital aspect of living a healthy and fulfilling life.”",gpt
New packaging and plant-based fish: How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback,"Bumble Bee Foods, a legacy name in the canned seafood industry, is making waves with a bold new strategy aimed at revitalizing its brand and appealing to a modern, eco-conscious consumer base. The company, which has been a staple in American kitchens for over a century, is now introducing a fresh lineup of products and innovative packaging solutions to reinvigorate its place in the market.

At the forefront of Bumble Bee's comeback strategy is its new line of plant-based fish alternatives. Recognizing the growing consumer shift towards plant-based diets for health and environmental reasons, Bumble Bee has partnered with Good Catch, a leader in plant-based seafood, to develop a fish-free tuna alternative. This collaboration brings together Bumble Bee's extensive market knowledge and distribution networks with Good Catch's expertise in creating plant-based proteins that mimic the taste and texture of seafood.

The plant-based tuna is crafted from a blend of six legumes—peas, chickpeas, lentils, soy, fava beans, and navy beans—providing a high-protein, sustainable option for consumers looking to reduce their seafood consumption without sacrificing the flavors they enjoy. With this new product, Bumble Bee aims to cater to flexitarians, vegetarians, and vegans while addressing environmental concerns such as overfishing and the depletion of ocean resources.

In tandem with its new product line, Bumble Bee is also reinventing its packaging to better align with its sustainability goals. The company has committed to using 100% recyclable materials for its cans and has introduced a new labeling system designed to provide clearer information on the sustainability of its seafood sources. This move is part of a broader initiative to improve transparency and trust with consumers, who are increasingly demanding accountability from the brands they support.

The new packaging features a modern design with bold visuals that highlight the company's commitment to sustainability and innovation. Bumble Bee's CEO, Jan Tharp, stated, ""We are reimagining our brand for today's consumer. Our new packaging reflects our dedication to environmental responsibility and our ongoing efforts to provide high-quality, sustainable seafood options.""

This strategic shift comes at a critical time for Bumble Bee, which has faced significant challenges in recent years. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2019 amid legal issues and financial struggles. However, since being acquired by FCF Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese seafood company, Bumble Bee has been working diligently to rebuild its brand and regain consumer trust.

The introduction of plant-based alternatives and sustainable packaging is not just a response to market trends but also a proactive step to future-proof the company in an industry that is rapidly evolving. According to market research firm Nielsen, the plant-based food sector has seen exponential growth, with sales increasing by over 20% annually in recent years. This presents a significant opportunity for Bumble Bee to capture a share of this burgeoning market.

Industry experts see Bumble Bee's initiatives as a positive step towards addressing some of the pressing environmental issues associated with traditional fishing practices. ""Bumble Bee's pivot to plant-based options and sustainable packaging is a smart move in today's market,"" said Dr. Sarah Norton, a food industry analyst. ""Consumers are more informed and more concerned about where their food comes from and its impact on the planet.""

As Bumble Bee navigates this transition, the company acknowledges the challenges ahead. Educating consumers about plant-based seafood and convincing traditional tuna lovers to try these alternatives will be a significant hurdle. However, with strategic marketing campaigns and partnerships with retailers, Bumble Bee is optimistic about its ability to shift consumer perceptions and expand its customer base.

In conclusion, Bumble Bee's efforts to reinvent its brand through innovative products and sustainable practices are setting a new standard in the seafood industry. As the company strives to meet the demands of today's environmentally conscious consumers, its success may well depend on its ability to blend tradition with innovation—a balance that could redefine the future of seafood consumption.",gpt
Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,"In a remarkable discovery that has captivated historians and photography enthusiasts alike, a collection of discarded photo negatives has surfaced, offering a rare glimpse into China during a period of significant transformation. These visuals, believed to date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, provide a window into a nation on the brink of unprecedented economic and social change.

The negatives were found by a local antique dealer in a small market in Beijing. Stored in a dusty, forgotten box, the collection includes hundreds of images depicting everyday life across various regions of China. From bustling city streets to serene rural landscapes, the photos showcase the dichotomy of a country balancing its rich cultural heritage with the rapid modernization that was beginning to take hold.

One of the most striking aspects of these images is their ability to capture the essence of a transitional era. During this time, China was emerging from the shadows of the Cultural Revolution and embarking on a series of economic reforms initiated by then-leader Deng Xiaoping. These reforms would eventually propel China to become one of the world's largest economies, but in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the changes were just beginning to take root.

The photos reveal scenes of both continuity and change. In urban areas, images show bicycles dominating the streets, a testament to the era before the widespread adoption of automobiles. Street vendors and open-air markets appear frequently, illustrating the burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit that Deng's policies were beginning to encourage. Meanwhile, in rural areas, traditional farming practices are depicted, underscoring the challenges faced by those in the countryside as they began to adapt to new agricultural policies.

Experts who have examined the negatives believe that they could have been taken by an amateur photographer, possibly someone with access to various parts of the country. The anonymity of the photographer adds another layer of intrigue to the collection. ""These photographs are an invaluable historical resource,"" said Dr. Li Wei, a historian specializing in modern Chinese history. ""They provide a unique perspective on a pivotal moment in China's development, capturing the nuances of daily life during a time of profound change.""

In addition to their historical significance, the negatives are also of considerable artistic value. The images are characterized by their candidness and spontaneity, qualities that offer an unfiltered portrayal of life in China at the time. Unlike the more polished and staged photographs often associated with official state propaganda from the era, these images provide an authentic glimpse into the lives of ordinary people.

The discovery of these negatives has sparked interest not only among historians and photographers but also among the general public. Plans are underway to digitize the collection and make it accessible online, allowing people from around the world to explore this fascinating chapter in China's history. An exhibition featuring prints from the negatives is also being organized, with the aim of touring major cities in China and abroad.

As the world continues to witness China's rapid evolution on the global stage, these images serve as a poignant reminder of the country's recent past. They highlight the resilience and adaptability of a nation navigating the complexities of modernization while grappling with the legacy of its revolutionary past.

For many, the photographs evoke a sense of nostalgia, particularly for those who lived through the era depicted. ""Looking at these images brings back so many memories,"" said Zhang Min, a Beijing resident who grew up in the 1980s. ""They remind me of how much has changed and how far we've come.""

The discovery of these discarded photo negatives is a testament to the power of photography to preserve history and evoke reflection. As plans to preserve and share the collection move forward, these images will undoubtedly continue to inspire dialogue and exploration into a transformative period in China's history, offering invaluable insights for generations to come.",gpt
Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Wall Street witnessed a significant rebound today, following a historic plunge that rattled global markets earlier this week. The recovery signals renewed investor confidence amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Major indices posted significant gains as market participants digested a slew of positive earnings reports and reassurances from the Federal Reserve.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 450 points, or approximately 1.5%, recovering nearly half of the losses experienced during the dramatic sell-off just days before. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a robust increase of 2.1%, driven by strong performances from tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft.

Investor sentiment was buoyed by a series of optimistic earnings reports from major corporations, which helped alleviate fears of an impending economic downturn. Notable among these was Procter & Gamble, which exceeded analysts' expectations, citing robust consumer demand across its product lines. Similarly, Tesla reported record deliveries and revenue, driving its stock up by 3.5%.

The Federal Reserve also played a crucial role in stabilizing the markets. In a statement, Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to supporting economic growth, emphasizing that interest rates would remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. Powell's comments were interpreted as a reassuring signal to investors, who have been jittery over potential rate hikes amid inflationary pressures.

""This bounce-back is a testament to the market's resilience,"" commented Sarah Johnson, chief economist at Global Markets Advisory. ""While volatility remains a concern, the fundamentals of the economy are strong, and today's recovery reflects that.""

Despite the positive developments, some analysts urge caution, pointing to the persistent challenges facing the global economy. Supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the lingering effects of the pandemic continue to cast a shadow over the market's long-term trajectory. Moreover, the upcoming release of new economic data, including the latest jobs report, could sway investor sentiment in the coming days.

""The market's recovery is encouraging, but it's important to remain vigilant,"" said Mark Thompson, a senior analyst at Hamilton Financial. ""We're not out of the woods yet, and any unexpected developments could reignite volatility.""

Amid the rebound, certain sectors stood out. The technology sector, which took a significant hit during the recent sell-off, led the recovery. Companies like Nvidia and Amazon recorded impressive gains, with their stocks rising 4.2% and 3.8%, respectively. The energy sector also saw a boost, as oil prices stabilized, leading to an uptick in shares of major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

Conversely, the healthcare sector lagged behind, with some companies experiencing mixed results in their earnings reports. Despite this, industry leaders remain optimistic about future growth, particularly as advancements in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals continue to drive innovation.

As Wall Street regains its footing, investors will be closely watching the upcoming G20 summit, where world leaders are expected to discuss strategies for fostering economic stability and addressing global challenges. The outcomes of these discussions could have significant implications for international markets and investor confidence.

In the meantime, market watchers will continue to monitor developments in Washington, as lawmakers negotiate over key economic policies, including infrastructure spending and tax reforms. The outcome of these negotiations could play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape and influencing market dynamics.

In conclusion, today's recovery on Wall Street underscores the market's capacity for resilience in the face of adversity. While uncertainties persist, the combination of strong corporate earnings, supportive monetary policy, and cautious optimism among investors sets the stage for potential stability in the weeks ahead. As the situation evolves, market participants will remain vigilant, ready to adapt to new information and challenges as they arise.",gpt
Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"In a political climate marked by division and heightened tensions, the Democratic Party faces what some members see as an inevitable course of action: the impeachment of former President Donald Trump. This decision comes amid ongoing investigations into his activities and rhetoric, which, according to party leaders, have continued to influence American politics and society in profound ways.

The push for impeachment is not without precedent. Trump was impeached twice during his presidency, once in 2019 over charges related to abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again in 2021 for incitement of insurrection following the January 6 Capitol riot. Despite these previous efforts, Trump was acquitted both times by the Senate. Now, with new allegations and concerns about his influence, Democrats argue that impeachment is not just a political maneuver but a necessary action to uphold the integrity of the country's democratic institutions.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a key figure in past impeachment proceedings, has expressed support for exploring this option. ""The actions and rhetoric of Donald Trump continue to pose a threat to our democracy,"" Pelosi said in a recent statement. ""We have a duty to the American people to hold him accountable.""

The impetus for this renewed call for impeachment comes amid a series of ongoing investigations. These include inquiries into the handling of classified documents, alleged attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and the former president's financial dealings. Critics argue that Trump's continued prominence in American politics and his potential candidacy in the 2024 presidential election make these issues particularly urgent.

Democrats are also motivated by what they perceive as a growing threat posed by Trump's influence over the Republican Party and the broader political landscape. ""Trump's hold over the GOP has only strengthened since he left office,"" said Representative Adam Schiff, a vocal advocate for impeachment. ""If we do not act, we risk normalizing behavior that undermines our democratic principles.""

However, the path to impeachment is fraught with challenges. The Democratic Party holds a slim majority in the House of Representatives, and any impeachment effort would require substantial support from the Senate, where Democrats do not have a commanding majority. Conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds vote, meaning at least some Republican senators would need to break ranks with their party.

The political ramifications of pursuing impeachment are also a subject of debate within the Democratic Party. Some members express concerns that another impeachment could further polarize the nation and distract from legislative priorities such as economic recovery, healthcare reform, and climate change initiatives. Others argue that failing to act would set a dangerous precedent.

Public opinion on the matter remains deeply divided. According to a recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, Americans are split on the issue of impeachment, with opinions largely falling along partisan lines. While a majority of Democrats support impeachment proceedings, a significant portion of Republicans view it as a politically motivated attack on Trump.

Despite these challenges, Democratic leaders appear resolute in their course of action. The party is expected to hold hearings and gather evidence in the coming months to determine the feasibility and timing of impeachment proceedings. ""We understand the gravity of this decision,"" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. ""But we cannot shy away from our responsibility to protect the Constitution and the rule of law.""

As the nation watches closely, the outcome of this impeachment effort remains uncertain. What is clear, however, is that the decision to pursue this path underscores the enduring impact of Donald Trump on American politics. As Democrats weigh their options, the implications of their choice will undoubtedly shape the political landscape for years to come.

In the meantime, the nation braces for what is likely to be a contentious and highly publicized process. Whether it results in impeachment or not, the actions taken by the Democratic Party will serve as a defining moment in the ongoing saga of former President Donald Trump.",gpt
The real terror threat in America is homegrown,"In recent years, the landscape of terrorism in the United States has shifted dramatically, with homegrown extremism emerging as a predominant threat. This development has prompted a reevaluation of security strategies and resources, as federal and state agencies grapple with a new reality that challenges traditional perceptions of terrorism.

According to a 2023 report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), incidents of domestic terrorism have surpassed those linked to foreign groups. The report highlights an increase in racially motivated and anti-government ideologies contributing to violent acts across the country. FBI Director Christopher Wray remarked during a Senate hearing earlier this year, ""The threat posed by domestic violent extremists is persistent, evolving, and deadly.""

A significant factor contributing to this rise is the proliferation of online platforms that facilitate the spread of extremist ideologies. Social media and encrypted messaging apps have become breeding grounds for radicalization, enabling individuals to connect with like-minded extremists and access a vast array of propaganda. These platforms often provide anonymity, making it challenging for law enforcement to identify and track potential threats.

In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases underscoring the danger posed by homegrown extremists. The 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, which targeted Hispanic individuals and resulted in 23 deaths, was perpetrated by an individual motivated by white supremacist beliefs. Similarly, the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which resulted in numerous injuries and fatalities, was carried out by individuals espousing anti-government sentiments.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has responded to these threats by prioritizing the prevention of domestic terrorism. In January 2022, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the creation of a dedicated unit to counter domestic violent extremism. This unit focuses on enhancing intelligence gathering, improving information sharing between federal and local agencies, and supporting community-based interventions.

Despite these efforts, challenges remain. One major obstacle is the balance between ensuring public safety and protecting civil liberties. Critics argue that increased surveillance and policing of domestic extremism could infringe on individuals' rights to free speech and privacy. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have expressed concerns about potential overreach by law enforcement.

Moreover, the decentralized nature of homegrown extremism complicates efforts to combat it. Unlike foreign terrorist organizations with hierarchical structures, domestic extremists often operate independently or in small, loosely affiliated groups. This makes it difficult to predict and prevent attacks, as there may be no clear chain of command or coordinated planning.

Experts also point to the role of socio-political factors in fueling domestic extremism. Economic disparities, political polarization, and a perceived erosion of traditional values have created fertile ground for radicalization. Dr. Jessica Reilly, a sociologist specializing in extremism, notes, ""When individuals feel marginalized or threatened, they may turn to extremist ideologies as a way to assert their identity and push back against perceived injustices.""

Addressing the root causes of homegrown extremism requires a multifaceted approach. Community engagement and education are essential components of prevention efforts. Initiatives aimed at fostering dialogue and understanding among diverse groups can help reduce tensions and build resilience against extremist influences.

Furthermore, strengthening mental health services is crucial. Many individuals drawn to extremist ideologies struggle with underlying psychological issues. Providing access to mental health care and support can help address these vulnerabilities before they escalate into violence.

As the United States navigates this evolving threat landscape, collaboration between government agencies, technology companies, and civil society is vital. By working together, stakeholders can develop comprehensive strategies to counter homegrown extremism while safeguarding the values of freedom and democracy.

The rise of homegrown terrorism presents a formidable challenge for America, demanding vigilance and adaptability. As the nation confronts this complex issue, understanding the underlying dynamics and fostering a united front will be key to ensuring a safer, more secure future.",gpt
The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"In recent years, a series of videos released by anti-abortion activists have sparked heated debates across the nation, casting Planned Parenthood in a controversial light. These videos, purportedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue, have fueled legislative battles and mobilized activists on both sides of the abortion debate. However, a deeper look into the origins, context, and implications of these videos reveals a complex narrative that challenges initial perceptions.

The videos in question were released by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), an anti-abortion organization led by activist David Daleiden. Under the guise of a fictitious biomedical research company, CMP operatives secretly recorded conversations with Planned Parenthood officials. These videos were heavily edited and released to the public in 2015, generating widespread outrage and calls for defunding the organization.

Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care and education, has consistently denied any wrongdoing. In response to the videos, it asserted that the footage was deceptively edited to misrepresent its activities. The organization maintains that any fetal tissue donations were conducted legally, with patient consent, and in compliance with federal laws that allow for reimbursement of costs associated with tissue procurement.

Independent forensic analyses of the videos have supported Planned Parenthood's claims. Reports from experts, including a 2015 analysis by Fusion GPS, concluded that the videos were manipulated, with significant portions either missing or edited out of context. Despite these findings, the videos have had a lasting impact, influencing public opinion and policy.

The release of the videos prompted federal and state investigations into Planned Parenthood's practices. While several states launched inquiries, none found evidence of illegal activity by Planned Parenthood. In 2016, a grand jury in Texas cleared the organization of any wrongdoing and instead indicted Daleiden and another CMP member on charges related to their undercover activities. These charges were later dismissed, but the legal battles continued.

In 2019, a federal jury in California found CMP and Daleiden liable for fraud, breach of contract, and violation of federal and state laws. The jury awarded Planned Parenthood nearly $2.3 million in damages, further affirming the organization's stance that the videos were part of a targeted smear campaign.

The controversy surrounding the videos has had significant political ramifications. It invigorated legislative efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, with anti-abortion lawmakers citing the videos as evidence of unethical practices. However, defunding attempts have faced legal and procedural hurdles, given that Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of health services beyond abortion, including cancer screenings, birth control, and sexual education.

Public response to the videos and subsequent investigations has been deeply polarized. For many anti-abortion advocates, the videos confirmed their long-held suspicions about Planned Parenthood's operations, reinforcing calls for stricter regulations and oversight. Conversely, supporters of Planned Parenthood argue that the videos represent an attack on women's reproductive rights, part of a broader agenda to restrict access to safe and legal abortion.

The debate over Planned Parenthood and the videos reflects broader societal tensions surrounding reproductive rights in the United States. As the country grapples with shifting political landscapes and evolving public attitudes, the underlying issues of access, autonomy, and ethics in reproductive health care remain contentious.

Ultimately, the Planned Parenthood videos serve as a potent reminder of the power of media in shaping public discourse and policy. They highlight the challenges of navigating truth and misinformation in an era where digital content can rapidly influence opinions and actions. As the nation continues to debate the role of organizations like Planned Parenthood, the real story behind these videos underscores the importance of critical engagement with the information that informs public consciousness.",gpt

Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"Kimbal Musk, brother of tech mogul Elon Musk, is making waves in the agriculture industry with his latest venture aimed at transforming modern farming. Known for his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to sustainable practices, Kimbal is setting his sights on revolutionizing the way food is grown and consumed.

Kimbal Musk, already a notable figure in the food and agriculture sector, has announced the launch of a new initiative that seeks to address some of the most pressing challenges facing agriculture today. With a focus on sustainability, technology, and community engagement, the venture aims to create a more resilient and equitable food system.

At the heart of Kimbal's vision is the integration of cutting-edge technology with traditional farming practices. By leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and data analysis, the initiative seeks to optimize crop yields while minimizing environmental impact. ""Our goal is to create a system that not only feeds people but also nurtures the planet,"" Kimbal Musk stated in a recent interview.

Central to this transformation is the implementation of vertical farming techniques, which allow for the cultivation of crops in stacked layers, often in controlled, indoor environments. This method not only maximizes space but also significantly reduces water usage and eliminates the need for harmful pesticides. Kimbal Musk's initiative plans to introduce these techniques across various urban centers, bringing fresh produce closer to consumers and reducing the carbon footprint associated with traditional agricultural practices.

In addition to technological innovation, Kimbal Musk emphasizes the importance of community involvement in his farming initiative. By partnering with local farmers and organizations, the project aims to create job opportunities and foster economic growth in rural areas. ""We believe that empowering local communities is key to building a sustainable food system,"" Musk explained. ""It's about bringing people together to create a positive impact.""

Kimbal Musk's initiative also plans to address issues of food accessibility and nutrition. With a rising global population and increasing concerns about food security, ensuring that healthy, affordable food is accessible to all is a top priority. The project aims to provide educational programs focused on nutrition and sustainable agriculture, equipping communities with the knowledge and resources needed to make informed food choices.

The agricultural sector has long been criticized for its environmental impact, with traditional farming practices contributing to deforestation, soil degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, Kimbal Musk's initiative seeks to change this narrative by promoting regenerative agriculture practices. These methods focus on restoring soil health, increasing biodiversity, and capturing carbon from the atmosphere, ultimately leading to more sustainable and resilient farming systems.

Kimbal Musk's efforts have garnered attention from investors and industry leaders, many of whom see the potential for significant impact. ""What Kimbal is proposing is not just a change in how we farm, but a complete rethinking of our relationship with food and the environment,"" said Sarah Thompson, an agricultural economist. ""It's ambitious, but it's the kind of innovation we need to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.""

However, transforming the agricultural industry is not without its challenges. Critics argue that the high initial costs associated with implementing advanced technologies could be a barrier for small-scale farmers. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential loss of traditional farming knowledge and practices.

Despite these challenges, Kimbal Musk remains optimistic about the future of farming. ""Change is never easy, but it's necessary,"" he said. ""We have the technology and the knowledge to create a more sustainable food system. Now, it's about putting it into action and making it accessible to everyone.""

As the world grapples with the effects of climate change and a growing demand for food, Kimbal Musk's initiative represents a bold step towards a more sustainable future. By harnessing the power of technology and community, he aims to create a farming model that not only feeds the population but also protects the planet for generations to come.",gpt
Which generation has it worse? (Opinion),"In recent years, the debate over which generation faces the most daunting challenges has intensified, drawing opinions from economists, sociologists, and everyday individuals alike. The discussion often centers around four primary cohorts: Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z. Each generation presents unique struggles and advantages, shaped by the economic, social, and technological landscapes of their formative years.

Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, are often seen as the beneficiaries of a post-war economic boom. They grew up in an era marked by unprecedented economic growth, increasing homeownership, and the expansion of social programs. However, critics argue that Baby Boomers have left a mixed legacy. While many have enjoyed stable careers and pensions, they also contributed to policies that exacerbated wealth inequality and environmental degradation. As they approach retirement, many Boomers face rising healthcare costs and an uncertain future for Social Security, adding to their woes.

Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980, is often dubbed the ""forgotten generation."" They came of age during a time of economic uncertainty, characterized by high inflation rates and the decline of manufacturing jobs. Consequently, many Gen Xers have faced job instability and stagnant wages. However, they are also seen as a resilient cohort, adapting to rapid technological changes and maintaining a pragmatic approach to life. Gen Xers are currently in their peak earning years, but they also shoulder the ""sandwich generation"" burden, juggling responsibilities for both aging parents and children.

Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, have arguably faced some of the harshest economic conditions in recent memory. They entered adulthood during the Great Recession, which eroded job prospects and delayed traditional milestones such as homeownership and marriage. Millennials are often criticized for their perceived sense of entitlement, yet this overlooks the economic challenges they have endured, including crippling student debt and an inflated housing market. Despite these hurdles, Millennials are credited with driving social change, embracing diversity, and advocating for mental health awareness.

Generation Z, born from 1997 onward, is still in its formative years but already faces significant challenges. This generation is growing up amidst a digital revolution, climate crisis, and political polarization. They are the first true digital natives, navigating a world where social media shapes identity and communication. While Gen Z is praised for its adaptability and activism, it also grapples with mental health issues at unprecedented rates. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated their educational and career prospects, casting a shadow over their future financial stability.

Each generation's struggles are deeply intertwined with broader societal changes. The Baby Boomers' post-war prosperity set the stage for the economic challenges faced by subsequent generations. The globalization and technological advancements experienced by Gen X paved the way for the digital economy that Millennials and Gen Z now navigate. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that these generational experiences are not monolithic. Factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status significantly influence individual experiences within each cohort.

While it is tempting to declare a ""winner"" in this generational struggle, the reality is more nuanced. Each generation has faced unique challenges while contributing to societal progress in distinct ways. The Baby Boomers' expansion of social programs laid the groundwork for future generations' demands for equality and justice. Gen X's adaptability and skepticism have informed a balanced approach to change, while Millennials' advocacy for social issues has reshaped societal norms. Meanwhile, Generation Z's digital fluency and activism promise to drive future innovations and reforms.

Ultimately, the question of which generation has it worse may be less important than understanding how each generation's experiences shape our collective future. By acknowledging the challenges and contributions of each cohort, we can foster intergenerational dialogue and collaboration. In a rapidly changing world, the path forward lies not in division but in recognizing our shared humanity and working together to address the complex issues facing society today.",gpt
Photographer Daniel Arnold visits the center and sidelines of the world's largest gem show,"Renowned street photographer Daniel Arnold has once again turned his lens toward an unconventional subject, capturing the vibrant essence of the world's largest gem show. Held annually in Tucson, Arizona, the event attracts collectors, dealers, and enthusiasts from across the globe. Arnold's visit this year offered a unique perspective into both the central attractions and the often-overlooked fringe activities that define the gem show experience.

The Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase, a sprawling event that takes over the city every January through February, features over 50 different shows ranging from high-end exhibitions to niche collections. While many photographers focus on the dazzling displays of rare gemstones and meticulously curated booths, Arnold's work delves deeper, revealing the human stories behind the spectacle.

Arnold, celebrated for his candid street photography and keen eye for detail, approached the gem show with the same curiosity and authenticity that have become his trademarks. ""I wanted to capture the event in its entirety—not just the polished items in the glass cases but also the people who make this gathering what it is,"" Arnold explained in an interview.

His photographs from the event are a tapestry of contrasts: the intense sparkle of a rare diamond juxtaposed against the worn hands of a miner showcasing raw stones; the opulence of a high-stakes auction room set against the bustling, makeshift outdoor stalls where independent vendors haggle over prices. Arnold's work brings to light the diverse ecosystem that sustains the gem show, from elite collectors and jewelers to the passionate hobbyists and families who participate year after year.

One standout image features a young girl holding a chunk of uncut amethyst, her eyes wide with wonder as she listens to a vendor’s explanation of its origins. Another photograph captures an intimate moment between two seasoned dealers, their faces lined with years of experience, sharing a quiet conversation amid the chaos of a crowded hall. These images highlight the intergenerational and multicultural exchanges that occur throughout the event, underscoring the gem show’s role as a melting pot of ideas and cultures.

Arnold’s exploration of the sidelines of the gem show is equally compelling. He ventured into the temporary tents and parking lot setups that are home to a more underground aspect of the gem trade. Here, outside the glitzy convention centers, Arnold found an array of unique stories: a couple who have traveled from Brazil for decades to sell hand-carved stone figurines, a retired geologist who now spends his time educating young visitors about fossil history, and a local artisan crafting jewelry from ethically sourced materials.

""These are the areas where you see the real passion and dedication,"" Arnold noted. ""It's not just commerce—it's a community, a shared love for the earth's natural wonders.""

The gem show, with its mix of commercial and cultural significance, provides a rich canvas for Arnold's storytelling. His photographs not only document the event but also invite viewers to consider the deeper narratives at play—how the search for beauty and value in stones reflects broader human experiences and aspirations.

As Arnold’s images gain traction on social media and in art circles, they are prompting discussions about the often-unseen aspects of such global events. The photographer's commitment to showcasing both the glittering centerpieces and the lively margins of the gem show offers a comprehensive look at this annual phenomenon, reminding viewers of the interconnectedness of the industry and the individuals who breathe life into it.

Arnold's work will be featured in an upcoming exhibition titled ""Glimmers and Shadows: Stories from the Gem Show,"" set to open in New York City later this year. The exhibition promises to offer an immersive experience, combining Arnold’s evocative photography with anecdotes and interviews from his time in Tucson.

As the gem show concludes, Arnold’s photographs serve as a lasting testament to an event that dazzles with its scale and diversity. Through his lens, the world’s largest gem show is revealed as not just a marketplace for precious stones but a vibrant, dynamic community reflecting the myriad facets of human connection.",gpt
Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout,"In a bid to stabilize the faltering economy, Congress is closing in on a stimulus deal with the White House amid a significant downturn on Wall Street. The proposed agreement seeks to inject much-needed financial support into various sectors as market volatility raises concerns over economic recovery.

Negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House have intensified in recent days as both sides work to finalize details of the stimulus package. According to insiders familiar with the discussions, the deal is expected to include direct payments to individuals, extended unemployment benefits, and substantial support for small businesses and industries hit hardest by the pandemic.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have been in regular communication with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and White House economic adviser Brian Deese. Both parties have expressed optimism that an agreement is within reach, though some sticking points remain.

""The American people are counting on us to provide relief during these challenging times,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""We are committed to securing a deal that addresses the urgent needs of our citizens and supports a sustainable economic recovery.""

On the other side of the aisle, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has acknowledged the necessity of a stimulus package but emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility. ""While we recognize the importance of immediate relief, it is vital that any package is carefully crafted to avoid exacerbating our national debt,"" McConnell said during a press briefing.

The urgency of reaching a consensus has been underscored by recent market turmoil. Wall Street experienced a significant rout this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting by over 800 points, marking its worst day in months. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index also suffered sharp declines, fueling fears of an extended bear market.

Analysts attribute the market downturn to a combination of factors, including concerns over rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the Federal Reserve's plans to taper its bond-buying program. The uncertainty surrounding the stimulus negotiations has only added to investor anxiety.

""The markets are reacting to a perfect storm of economic challenges,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""A comprehensive stimulus package could provide a much-needed boost to consumer confidence and market stability.""

The proposed stimulus deal is expected to allocate substantial funding for pandemic-related healthcare initiatives, including vaccine distribution and testing. Additionally, it aims to bolster infrastructure projects and provide aid to state and local governments facing budget shortfalls.

Small business owners, who have been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, are hopeful that the stimulus package will offer a lifeline. ""We've been struggling to keep our doors open,"" said Maria Rodriguez, owner of a small restaurant in Chicago. ""A new round of financial support could make all the difference for us and many others in our situation.""

As the negotiations continue, the timeline for passing the stimulus package remains uncertain. Congressional leaders are eager to move swiftly, but the complexities of the deal and the legislative process could delay its finalization. Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement on the need for action.

""The stakes are incredibly high,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren. ""We have an opportunity to provide relief to millions of Americans and lay the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient economy.""

With the economy at a crossroads, the outcome of these negotiations could shape the nation's financial landscape for years to come. As both sides work to bridge their differences, the American public watches closely, hoping for swift and decisive action to address the challenges at hand.",gpt
"South Korea has 'passed the peak' of the coronavirus outbreak, health minister hopes","South Korea has ""passed the peak"" of the current coronavirus outbreak, according to Health Minister Park Neung-hoo. Speaking at a press conference in Seoul on Tuesday, Park expressed cautious optimism about the nation's battle against the virus, which has seen fluctuating case numbers since the onset of the pandemic.

The statement comes as South Korea reported its lowest number of new daily cases in months, a positive sign that the stringent public health measures and vaccination efforts are beginning to show results. As of Monday, the country recorded 1,544 new COVID-19 infections, a significant decrease from the numbers observed during the peak of the outbreak.

""We are cautiously optimistic that we have passed the peak of this wave,"" Park said. ""Our healthcare system remains robust, and the cooperation of the public has been instrumental in reaching this point.""

The health minister attributed the decline in cases to the country's comprehensive testing regime, effective contact tracing, and widespread compliance with social distancing measures. The government has also ramped up its vaccination campaign, with nearly 70% of the population now fully vaccinated.

Despite the encouraging news, Park urged continued vigilance. ""While we are seeing a decrease in cases, it is crucial that we do not become complacent,"" he warned. ""The virus remains a formidable adversary, and we must continue to adhere to public health guidelines to prevent another surge.""

South Korea has been lauded internationally for its handling of the pandemic, particularly during the initial outbreaks. The nation's strategy has focused on a mix of aggressive testing, contact tracing, and quarantine measures, all while avoiding the full lockdowns seen in other parts of the world. This approach has allowed the country to maintain a semblance of normalcy while battling the virus.

The government has also been proactive in securing vaccines, utilizing a diverse portfolio of shots from various manufacturers. Recent data indicates that the majority of the population has received at least one dose, and booster shots are being administered to at-risk groups, including the elderly and healthcare workers.

Experts, however, caution that several challenges remain. The emergence of new variants poses a potential threat, and vaccine hesitancy could hinder efforts to reach herd immunity. Additionally, the approaching winter months could lead to increased indoor gatherings, heightening the risk of transmission.

Seoul resident Kim Min-jung, who received her second vaccine dose last month, expressed relief at the news but shared the health minister's call for vigilance. ""It's a comfort to hear that we might be over the worst of it, but I think we all know how quickly things can change,"" she said.

Businesses, particularly in the hard-hit hospitality and tourism sectors, are also watching developments closely. Many have struggled under the weight of extended restrictions and are eager for a return to normal operations. The government has hinted at the possibility of easing some measures if the downward trend in cases continues.

In the meantime, authorities are focusing on maintaining the momentum of the vaccination rollout and preparing for potential future waves. Plans are in place to expand the availability of vaccines to younger populations, and the government is investing in local vaccine production to ensure a steady supply.

The situation in South Korea reflects broader global trends, as countries around the world grapple with the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. While vaccines offer hope, the road to recovery remains uncertain, with experts emphasizing the need for international cooperation and equitable vaccine distribution.

As South Korea navigates this critical phase, the government remains committed to its proactive approach in managing COVID-19. For now, the focus is on sustaining the current progress and ensuring that the nation is prepared for any challenges that lie ahead.",gpt
What it's like to be me,"In the bustling heart of Manhattan, beneath the luminous glow of towering skyscrapers, lives a person whose daily existence offers a unique perspective on the complexities of modern life. Meet Alex Johnson, a 35-year-old professional balancing the demands of a high-powered career with personal aspirations and societal expectations. This is what it's like to be Alex.

Every day begins with the sound of an alarm piercing the early morning silence at precisely 5:30 a.m. For Alex, mornings are a sacred time for reflection and preparation. “I need that quiet before the chaos,” Alex remarks, sipping a cup of freshly brewed coffee while glancing at the day’s agenda. As a project manager in a leading tech firm, Alex’s work demands precision and innovation, a challenge embraced with both enthusiasm and trepidation.

With a quick breakfast and a brisk walk to the subway, Alex joins the millions of commuters navigating the intricate web of New York City’s transit system. These moments, enveloped in the anonymity of the crowd, offer a paradoxical sense of solitude. “There’s something oddly comforting about being just another face in the sea of people,” Alex muses.

Arriving at the sleek, modern office building, Alex dives into a world dominated by deadlines and deliverables. The work is demanding, fueled by constant communication with teams across the globe. “It’s a whirlwind,” Alex admits, “but I thrive in it. The pace, the pressure—it keeps me sharp.” Despite the intensity, Alex finds fulfillment in leading projects that push technological boundaries and redefine user experiences.

Yet, beneath the professional veneer lies the challenge of maintaining a harmonious work-life balance. “It’s a juggling act,” Alex confesses. Weekends are cherished, offering a brief respite and an opportunity to indulge in personal interests, such as photography and hiking. “Nature is my escape,” Alex explains. “It reminds me there’s a world beyond the office walls.”

The complexity of Alex’s life is not solely defined by career ambitions. There’s a deep-seated commitment to community service, particularly in mentoring young professionals from underrepresented backgrounds. “I’ve been fortunate in my journey, and it’s important to give back,” Alex says. This sense of social responsibility is a guiding principle, shaping decisions both big and small.

Navigating personal identity is another facet of Alex’s experience. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Alex has faced challenges and triumphs in equal measure. “Being authentic in every aspect of my life is essential,” Alex states. “It hasn’t always been easy, but I’ve learned the power of embracing who I am.” This authenticity is reflected in Alex’s advocacy work, which aims to foster inclusivity and acceptance.

Despite a seemingly full and vibrant life, Alex is not immune to the universal human experience of doubt and introspection. “There are days when I question if I’m on the right path,” Alex admits candidly. It is in these moments of uncertainty that Alex turns to a trusted network of friends and family for support. “I’m incredibly grateful for the people in my life who lift me up,” Alex adds.

As the day winds down, Alex returns home, greeted by the comforting familiarity of a cozy apartment. Evenings are reserved for winding down, often with a good book or a favorite television show. “It’s my way of decompressing,” Alex says with a smile. The daily routine, though demanding, is punctuated by these moments of tranquility.

Reflecting on what it’s like to be Alex Johnson reveals a narrative shaped by ambition, resilience, and a deep commitment to living authentically. It is a story of navigating life’s complexities with grace and determination, while continually striving for both personal and professional growth. “I’m just trying to make the most of every day,” Alex concludes. “That’s what it’s like to be me.”

In a world that often demands conformity, Alex’s journey serves as a reminder of the importance of staying true to oneself, embracing every facet of one’s identity, and finding purpose in the everyday.",gpt
March 1 coronavirus news,"As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic, March 1 has brought a mix of developments globally. From vaccine rollouts to new variants, the fight against COVID-19 remains a top priority for governments and health organizations worldwide.

**Vaccine Rollouts and Distribution**

In the United States, the pace of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout has accelerated significantly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 75% of adults have received at least one dose, and nearly 65% are fully vaccinated. The Biden administration continues to push for booster shots, particularly in light of emerging variants. In a recent press briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC Director, emphasized the importance of boosters in maintaining immunity against severe disease.

Across the Atlantic, the European Union is also making strides in its vaccination campaign. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved a new vaccine, expanding the arsenal available to member states. This comes as several countries, including Germany and France, report successful uptake of booster doses among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and immunocompromised.

**Emergence of New Variants**

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has raised concerns about a new variant of the coronavirus identified in South Africa. Dubbed the ""Zeta"" variant, early studies suggest it may possess higher transmissibility than previous strains. WHO officials are working closely with scientists in South Africa to monitor the situation and assess the impact on vaccine efficacy.

Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, expressed caution but urged the public not to panic. ""We are closely monitoring this new variant and are in constant communication with our global network of researchers,"" she stated. ""Vaccination remains our most effective tool against COVID-19, and current evidence suggests that vaccines continue to provide significant protection against severe illness.""

**Impact on Healthcare Systems**

Healthcare systems around the world are feeling the strain as they manage both COVID-19 patients and routine medical care. In India, hospitals report a decline in COVID-19 cases, allowing them to resume elective surgeries and other non-COVID medical services. However, experts warn that the healthcare system remains fragile, urging officials to maintain preparedness for potential surges.

In contrast, parts of Eastern Europe are experiencing a resurgence in cases, with hospitals in Bulgaria and Romania nearing capacity. Health ministers in these countries are calling for international assistance, including additional medical supplies and personnel, to help manage the crisis.

**Economic and Social Implications**

The pandemic continues to impact global economies, with many countries struggling to balance public health measures and economic recovery. In the United Kingdom, the government has unveiled a new economic support package aimed at helping businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic. The package includes grants for small businesses and extensions to unemployment benefits.

On the social front, educators worldwide are navigating the challenges of hybrid and remote learning. In the United States, school districts are implementing measures to ensure the safe return of students to in-person classes. Masks and social distancing remain part of the strategy, alongside regular testing and vaccination drives for eligible students.

**Looking Ahead**

As the world marks yet another month in the battle against COVID-19, experts emphasize the importance of global cooperation and vigilance. ""We are in a much better position today than we were a year ago,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the U.S. ""But we must remain vigilant, continue to follow public health recommendations, and get vaccinated.""

The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the trajectory of the pandemic. With the potential for new variants and the ongoing challenge of vaccine distribution in low-income countries, the global community remains focused on a collective effort to bring the pandemic under control.

As March 1 unfolds, the world watches with cautious optimism, hoping for continued progress in the fight against COVID-19.",gpt
How NBA led in the sports world shutdown,"In an unprecedented move, the National Basketball Association (NBA) took the lead in the sports world shutdown on March 11, 2020, setting the stage for a global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NBA's decisive action to suspend its season marked a crucial turning point, highlighting the league's role as a pioneer in prioritizing public health and safety over the continuation of events, a decision that reverberated across the sports industry.

The catalyst for the NBA's historic decision was a positive COVID-19 test result for Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert. Moments before the Jazz were set to tip-off against the Oklahoma City Thunder, the game was abruptly postponed. In a matter of hours, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the suspension of the entire season, a move that stunned fans and players alike. This swift action demonstrated the league's commitment to safeguarding its athletes, staff, and fans amid growing concerns about the virus's spread.

The NBA's suspension was a watershed moment, prompting a domino effect across the sports world. Major League Baseball (MLB) followed suit, canceling spring training games and delaying the start of its season. The National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) quickly suspended their operations as well. In the weeks that followed, major sporting events worldwide, including the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, were postponed or canceled.

The NBA's leadership in this crisis was not only about halting games; it extended to broader efforts in public health advocacy. The league teamed up with public health officials to promote safety measures such as social distancing, handwashing, and wearing masks. Many NBA teams repurposed their facilities to serve as testing centers and vaccination sites, assisting in local and national efforts to combat the pandemic.

Financially, the suspension posed significant challenges. With games on hold, teams faced revenue losses from ticket sales, broadcasting rights, and merchandise. The NBA, however, demonstrated adaptability, negotiating with players' associations and stakeholders to manage the economic impact. The league's ability to organize the ""NBA Bubble"" at Walt Disney World in Florida to safely resume the season in July 2020 underscored its innovative approach. The bubble concept, which involved rigorous testing and quarantine protocols, proved successful in preventing virus outbreaks and allowed the league to conclude its season without incident.

The NBA's actions during the pandemic have been widely praised by public health experts and other sports organizations. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious diseases expert, lauded the NBA's decision-making as ""a model for how sports leagues can operate safely during a global health crisis."" The league's influence extended beyond sports, as its shutdown prompted businesses and institutions worldwide to reconsider their operations amid the pandemic.

Moreover, the NBA's leadership extended to addressing social justice issues that gained prominence during the pandemic. The league supported players in their calls for racial equality and justice, providing a platform for advocacy during games and beyond. This commitment to social issues further solidified the NBA's role as a leader in both sports and society.

Reflecting on the past three years, the NBA's initial decision to shut down was a crucial moment in the global response to COVID-19. It set a precedent for how sports organizations could effectively balance the imperatives of health and safety with their operational goals. The league's approach—marked by decisive action, innovative solutions, and a commitment to public welfare—has become a blueprint for managing crises in the sports world and beyond.

As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's long-term impacts, the NBA's leadership during the initial shutdown remains a testament to the power of making difficult decisions in uncertain times. The league's actions continue to influence how organizations navigate challenges, underscoring the importance of prioritizing health and community well-being in the face of adversity.",gpt
Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"In a bid to tackle the perennial issue of long queues at women’s restrooms, a novel solution is being explored: female urinals. As festival organizers, public event coordinators, and urban planners seek innovative ways to improve restroom efficiency, female urinals are gaining attention as a potential game-changer for gender-specific restroom design.

The concept of female urinals is not entirely new. They have been implemented in various forms across Europe and some parts of Asia, but their adoption has been sporadic and often met with mixed reactions. However, recent trials at several large-scale events have reignited the conversation about their potential benefits.

At the heart of this discussion is the persistent issue of longer wait times at women’s restrooms compared to men’s. This disparity is often attributed to a combination of factors, including the design of female restrooms, which traditionally offer fewer facilities than their male counterparts, and the longer average time women spend in restrooms. Female urinals, proponents argue, could significantly alleviate these issues by providing a faster alternative for women who do not require a full stall.

Recent trials at music festivals in the UK and the Netherlands have reported promising results. At the Glastonbury Festival, for instance, female urinals were introduced alongside traditional restroom facilities, resulting in noticeably reduced wait times. According to festival organizers, the inclusion of the urinals contributed to a 30% decrease in queue length in certain areas. Users reported mixed experiences, with some praising the convenience, while others expressed discomfort with the setup.

The design of female urinals has evolved over the years. Contemporary models aim to address privacy and comfort, two of the primary concerns raised by potential users. Some designs incorporate individual cubicles or partial enclosures to offer privacy, while others provide disposable funnels to assist with use. Despite these innovations, acceptance remains a significant hurdle.

Dr. Jane Thompson, a sociologist specializing in gender and space, notes that cultural attitudes towards public restroom use play a crucial role in the acceptance of female urinals. ""There is a deeply ingrained expectation of privacy and hygiene that shapes women’s experiences in public restrooms,"" she explains. ""Innovations like female urinals challenge these norms, which can make them difficult to accept on a broad scale.""

Nevertheless, advocates for female urinals argue that with effective education and thoughtful design, these facilities could become a staple in public spaces. They point to environmental benefits as well; female urinals typically require less water per use compared to traditional toilets, aligning with growing sustainability goals in urban infrastructure.

In urban settings, the challenge of restroom queues is not limited to events. Cities like Paris and Amsterdam are considering the integration of female urinals into public spaces as part of a broader push to improve gender equality in urban design. Pilot programs are in place, and early feedback suggests that while there is enthusiasm for the concept, successful implementation will require careful consideration of location, design, and public perception.

Critics, however, argue that female urinals should not be seen as a one-size-fits-all solution. They highlight the importance of maintaining a variety of restroom options to cater to diverse needs, including those of individuals with disabilities, older adults, and families with young children. The introduction of female urinals, they contend, should complement rather than replace existing facilities.

As the debate continues, it is clear that addressing restroom inequality requires a multifaceted approach. Female urinals, while promising, represent just one piece of a larger puzzle. For now, their role in the future of public restroom design remains a topic of discussion among experts, policymakers, and the public alike.

Ultimately, the success of female urinals will depend on their ability to meet users’ needs while overcoming cultural and logistical barriers. As cities and event organizers continue to experiment with this innovation, the hope is that they will contribute to more equitable and efficient public restroom experiences for all.",gpt
Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak,"In the annals of Malaysian political history, the fall of Najib Razak, the former Prime Minister embroiled in the multi-billion-dollar 1MDB scandal, is a story marked by political intrigue and public outrage. Yet, one of the most intriguing aspects of this saga is the role played by two cartoonists, Zunar and Fahmi Reza, whose satirical art became powerful symbols of resistance and dissent against a government fraught with allegations of corruption and abuse of power.

Zunar, whose real name is Zulkiflee Anwar Haque, began his career as a political cartoonist in the early 2000s. Known for his sharp wit and fearless critique of the Malaysian government, Zunar's cartoons have long been a thorn in the side of the country's political elite. His works, often published online due to government censorship of mainstream media, frequently depicted Najib and his administration as bumbling, corrupt figures, drawing attention to issues that many Malaysians felt powerless to address.

Fahmi Reza, on the other hand, emerged as a prominent voice against Najib's regime during the height of the 1MDB scandal. His most infamous work, a caricature of Najib as a clown, went viral and became a symbol of the people's disillusionment with the government. Fahmi's art was not just a form of protest but also a rallying cry that resonated with a younger generation of Malaysians demanding accountability and transparency.

Both artists faced significant risks for their outspoken views. Zunar was arrested multiple times and faced nine charges under the Sedition Act, a draconian law often used to stifle dissent. His books were banned, and he was subjected to a travel ban, preventing him from attending international events where he was recognized for his courage and contribution to freedom of expression. Despite these challenges, Zunar continued to draw, insisting that his pen was mightier than any government attempt to silence him.

Fahmi Reza's satirical works also attracted the attention of authorities. He was charged under the Communications and Multimedia Act for ""uploading offensive content"" and faced potential imprisonment. Nevertheless, Fahmi remained defiant, using social media to disseminate his work and galvanize public support. His clown caricature became an enduring image of resistance, shared widely across social media platforms and even appearing in street protests.

The impact of Zunar and Fahmi's work extended beyond mere criticism of Najib's government; it highlighted the power of art as a tool for social change. Their cartoons spoke to the frustrations of ordinary Malaysians and gave voice to a collective demand for justice. In a country where mainstream media was heavily regulated, their art provided an alternative narrative, one that dared to challenge the official version of events.

Their efforts, along with those of countless other activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens, contributed to a growing movement that ultimately led to Najib's defeat in the 2018 general elections. The historic election saw the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan, win a majority, ending the Barisan Nasional coalition's 61-year hold on power. Najib's subsequent arrest and trial on charges related to the 1MDB scandal marked a significant turning point for Malaysia, symbolizing a new era of accountability.

The stories of Zunar and Fahmi Reza underscore the importance of freedom of expression in a functioning democracy. Their fearless satire not only challenged the status quo but also inspired a nation to seek truth and justice. Today, as Malaysia continues to grapple with its political challenges, the legacy of these cartoonists serves as a reminder of the vital role art and satire play in holding power to account.

As the country moves forward, the contributions of Zunar and Fahmi Reza remain etched in the public consciousness, not just as artists but as catalysts for change. Their work continues to inspire new generations of Malaysians to speak out against injustice and strive for a better future, proving that sometimes, a simple cartoon can be a formidable weapon in the fight for democracy.",gpt
A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst,"Prison systems worldwide are confronting an unprecedented challenge as they grapple with the potential resurgence of COVID-19 and the emergence of other infectious diseases. The pandemic highlighted glaring vulnerabilities in correctional facilities, and experts warn that these institutions must implement rigorous measures to avert a public health crisis within their walls.

One of the primary concerns within prisons is overcrowding. Facilities often house more inmates than their capacity allows, making it nearly impossible to maintain social distancing. According to the World Health Organization, the close quarters and limited ventilation in many prisons create an ideal environment for the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Addressing overcrowding is essential, and some countries have already taken steps in this direction. For instance, several states in the U.S. implemented early release programs for non-violent offenders during the height of the pandemic, reducing the population density and, consequently, the risk of widespread outbreaks.

Hygiene is another critical area requiring attention. Many prisons lack adequate sanitation facilities, and access to basic hygiene products such as soap and sanitizer can be limited. Correctional institutions are being urged to improve sanitation standards, ensuring that inmates and staff have the necessary resources to maintain personal hygiene. Regular cleaning of common areas and the provision of protective equipment like masks are also crucial steps in preventing the spread of disease.

Healthcare within prisons has historically been underfunded and understaffed, a situation that the pandemic has exacerbated. To combat this, some governments are increasing healthcare funding specifically for correctional facilities. This involves not only boosting medical supplies but also enhancing the availability of medical staff. Regular health screenings and the establishment of isolation units for sick inmates are key strategies being adopted to identify and contain potential outbreaks swiftly.

Vaccination remains a cornerstone of infectious disease prevention. Ensuring that both inmates and staff are vaccinated against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is vital. However, vaccine hesitancy can be particularly prevalent in prison populations, often due to mistrust of the healthcare system. Education campaigns within prisons, aimed at providing clear and accurate information about the benefits and safety of vaccines, are crucial in overcoming this barrier.

In addition to these measures, technological solutions are being explored to improve monitoring and response strategies. Some prisons have begun using digital tools to track health data, facilitating quicker responses to potential outbreaks. These technologies can help in identifying trends and implementing timely interventions, thereby reducing the risk of widespread infection.

Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain. Funding constraints, political resistance, and logistical hurdles can impede the implementation of effective healthcare strategies within prisons. Advocacy groups continue to urge policymakers to prioritize the health and safety of incarcerated individuals, emphasizing that protecting these populations is not only a moral obligation but also a public health necessity.

The situation also calls for international cooperation, as infectious diseases do not recognize borders. Sharing best practices and resources between countries can enhance the global response to health challenges within prisons. The United Nations has been active in promoting guidelines and offering support to countries in need, aiming to establish a more unified and effective approach to prison healthcare.

As the world continues to navigate the complexities of the pandemic and prepares for future public health challenges, the focus on prison systems is both urgent and necessary. The lessons learned from COVID-19 are clear: neglecting the health of incarcerated populations can have far-reaching consequences, not only for those within the prisons but also for the broader community. By addressing the systemic issues that have long plagued correctional facilities, there is hope that the worst can be avoided, and a more resilient and equitable healthcare system can emerge.",gpt
SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"Political commentator and author SE Cupp has recently made waves with her vocal support for the establishment of a viable third political party in the United States. In a recent op-ed, Cupp argues that such a development could serve as a crucial corrective to the current polarized political climate, characterized by gridlock and divisiveness.

Cupp, known for her candid and often contrarian views, has long advocated for a more pragmatic and less partisan approach to American politics. Her latest commentary comes amid growing dissatisfaction with the two-party system, as evidenced by declining trust in government institutions and increased calls for political reform from both sides of the aisle.

""The Republican and Democratic parties have become entrenched in their ideologies, often focusing more on defeating each other than on solving the real issues facing Americans today,"" Cupp writes. ""A third party could introduce new ideas and perspectives that are desperately needed to break this cycle of dysfunction.""

The concept of a third party is not new in American politics. Historically, third parties have struggled to gain a foothold due to the dominance of the two major parties and structural barriers, such as the first-past-the-post electoral system. However, Cupp believes that the current political landscape presents a unique opportunity for a third party to thrive.

Several factors support Cupp's argument. Recent surveys indicate a growing number of Americans are identifying as independents, disenchanted with the platforms and policies of both major parties. According to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this year, 62% of Americans said a third major party is needed because the Republican and Democratic parties do such a poor job representing the American people.

Cupp suggests that a third party could appeal to this significant segment of the electorate by focusing on common-sense solutions and fostering a culture of compromise. She envisions a party that prioritizes issues such as fiscal responsibility, climate change, healthcare reform, and infrastructure development, while also emphasizing the importance of civil discourse and bipartisan cooperation.

Critics, however, caution that the formation of a third party could inadvertently exacerbate political division. They argue that a third party could siphon votes away from one of the major parties, potentially leading to outcomes that do not reflect the majority will. Additionally, the challenges of fundraising, gaining ballot access, and achieving visibility in national debates remain significant hurdles.

Nevertheless, Cupp remains optimistic. ""The American political system was designed to evolve,"" she writes. ""While the path to establishing a third party is fraught with challenges, the potential benefits far outweigh the risks. A third party could serve as a catalyst for meaningful change, prompting the major parties to reevaluate their platforms and engage more constructively with the issues at hand.""

Cupp's call for a third party has resonated with some political figures and grassroots movements. Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who launched the Forward Party last year, is among those advocating for a broader political spectrum. Yang's efforts have focused on building a coalition that transcends traditional partisan lines, emphasizing data-driven policies and electoral reform.

Additionally, organizations like Unite America are working to bridge the partisan divide by supporting bipartisan candidates and advocating for reforms such as ranked-choice voting, which could facilitate the emergence of a successful third party.

As the United States approaches the 2024 presidential election, the debate over the viability and necessity of a third party is likely to intensify. While the path forward is uncertain, Cupp's call to action highlights a growing desire among the electorate for a political system that better reflects the diverse perspectives and needs of the American populace.

In the coming months, political analysts and voters alike will be watching closely to see if this momentum can translate into tangible change. Whether or not a third party can gain a foothold remains to be seen, but the conversation it has sparked is an important step towards addressing the deep-seated issues plaguing American politics today.",gpt
'We are not alone': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy,"MILAN, Italy — As the clock struck midnight on March 10, 2020, the bustling streets of Italy's major cities fell silent. The Italian government had imposed a nationwide lockdown in an unprecedented move to contain the spread of the coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19. This measure, once unimaginable, rapidly transformed the lives of more than 60 million residents.

For many Italians, the abrupt transition into a life of isolation was jarring. Families who were accustomed to gathering for leisurely dinners and lively conversations found themselves confined within their homes. Streets once filled with the aroma of fresh espresso and the chatter of pedestrians turned eerily quiet. Yet, amidst the uncertainty and solitude, a powerful sense of community began to emerge, fueled by a shared understanding that, despite the physical separation, ""we are not alone.""

Francesca Bianchi, a 34-year-old teacher from Rome, describes the initial days of lockdown as surreal. ""It was like living in a ghost town,"" she says. ""But soon, I started to see signs of hope and solidarity. Neighbors who had never spoken before were suddenly checking in on each other, offering to share groceries or run errands for those who couldn't leave their homes.""

This newfound camaraderie has manifested in various forms across the country. In Naples, for instance, residents organized balcony serenades, where musicians played instruments and sang classic Italian songs, providing a much-needed morale boost. In Florence, artists took to the rooftops, painting vibrant murals that celebrated resilience and unity.

""These acts of kindness and creativity remind us that we're all in this together,"" says Luca Rossi, a psychologist based in Milan. ""The lockdown has forced us to slow down and appreciate the simple things, like a neighborly smile or a heartfelt message of encouragement.""

The Italian government has been keen to emphasize the importance of social distancing measures, urging citizens to adhere to the restrictions for the greater good. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte addressed the nation, acknowledging the sacrifices being made but emphasizing the critical role of collective action in overcoming the crisis. ""We are facing an invisible enemy,"" he stated, ""and our strength lies in our unity and discipline.""

Despite the challenges, Italians have found innovative ways to adapt. Remote work has become the norm, with businesses and educational institutions swiftly transitioning to virtual platforms. Even religious practices have moved online, with churches livestreaming masses to accommodate the faithful.

However, the lockdown has not been without its difficulties. The economic impact has been profound, with small businesses and the tourism industry bearing the brunt of the shutdown. Many workers face uncertainty about their livelihoods, prompting the government to introduce financial aid packages aimed at cushioning the blow.

Healthcare workers, too, are experiencing immense pressure as they confront the pandemic head-on. Hospitals across the country are operating at full capacity, with doctors and nurses working tirelessly to treat the influx of patients. In response, volunteers have stepped up to support medical staff, from delivering meals to assembling protective equipment.

As Italy navigates this unprecedented situation, the resilience and adaptability of its people remain evident. ""We are learning to cope with new realities,"" says Maria Conti, a grandmother from Venice. ""It's not easy, but we draw strength from each other. We sing from our balconies, we clap for our healthcare heroes, and we hold on to hope.""

Looking ahead, the question remains: how long will the lockdown last? While no definitive timeline has been provided, authorities are continuously assessing the situation, guided by the advice of health experts. For now, Italians remain united in their resolve, determined to weather the storm together.

In the face of adversity, Italy stands as a testament to the power of community and human spirit. As the world watches, the message echoes clear: we may be physically apart, but in heart and purpose, we are not alone.",gpt
Fraudsters get hefty prison terms for impersonating French minister,"In a landmark ruling that underscores the severity of digital impersonation crimes, a Parisian court has sentenced two men to substantial prison terms for impersonating a French government minister in a fraudulent scheme that duped dozens of high-profile figures and organizations out of millions of euros. The case has drawn significant attention across France and beyond, highlighting the vulnerabilities in modern communication systems and the sophisticated methods employed by fraudsters.

On Thursday, the court handed down an eight-year prison sentence to Gilbert Chikli, 54, and a five-year term to Anthony Lasarevitsch, 35, for their roles in orchestrating an elaborate scam that involved impersonating Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's former Minister of Defense and current Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs. The duo was found guilty of using fake identities and advanced communication technologies to solicit funds under the pretext of confidential and urgent state missions.

The court heard that Chikli, the mastermind behind the operation, and Lasarevitsch, his accomplice, perpetrated the fraud between 2015 and 2017. They operated primarily from Israel, using a meticulously crafted replica of Le Drian’s office, complete with the French flag and a portrait of then-President François Hollande, to convince their targets of the scheme’s legitimacy. They went so far as to utilize sophisticated voice-altering software to mimic Le Drian's voice in telephone conversations.

Among their targets were international dignitaries, business leaders, and humanitarian organizations, all of whom were persuaded to transfer large sums of money purportedly to support secretive French operations, such as anti-terrorism efforts or the payment of ransom for journalists held hostage in the Middle East. The scam managed to raise an estimated €55 million, although not all attempted frauds were successful.

The scheme's unraveling began when suspicions were raised by several intended victims, prompting an investigation by French authorities. The breakthrough came in 2017 when Chikli and Lasarevitsch were apprehended in Ukraine and subsequently extradited to France. Their trial, which began in early 2020, exposed the intricate details of their operations and featured testimonies from several individuals who had been approached by the imposters.

During the trial, prosecutors described Chikli as a ""master manipulator,"" detailing his previous conviction for a similar scheme in 2015, which had earned him a seven-year sentence and a €1 million fine in absentia. Lasarevitsch, who played a secondary role, was portrayed as an eager accomplice who facilitated the technical aspects of the fraud.

In delivering the sentence, Judge Frédérique Aline highlighted the sophistication and audacity of the crime, noting its wide-reaching implications for international diplomacy and security. ""This case serves as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of fraud in the digital age and the need for heightened vigilance,"" she stated.

Outside the courtroom, reactions to the verdict were mixed. Some hailed it as a significant step towards deterring future digital impersonation crimes, while others expressed concern over the potential for similar schemes to occur, given the rapid advancement of technology. Experts in cybersecurity have called for increased cooperation between nations to develop robust defenses against such scams and to ensure that perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.

The French government, meanwhile, has reiterated its commitment to protecting its officials and citizens from cybercrime. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs emphasized the importance of safeguarding official communications and urged the public to remain vigilant against potential scams.

As the perpetrators begin their prison sentences, the case of Gilbert Chikli and Anthony Lasarevitsch serves as a cautionary tale in an era where digital deception is becoming increasingly sophisticated and prevalent. The legal precedent set by their conviction is expected to resonate beyond France, influencing how similar cases are handled worldwide and encouraging more stringent measures to combat digital impersonation and fraud.",gpt

"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much

Stephen Sondheim, a towering figure in the world of musical theatre, was often described as a man whose profound emotional depth set him apart from his contemporaries. With a career spanning over six decades, Sondheim's work has left an indelible mark on Broadway and the broader cultural landscape. His ability to channel deep emotion into his compositions and lyrics earned him a reputation as a genius who felt perhaps more intensely than most.

Born on March 22, 1930, in New York City, Sondheim's early life was marked by turbulence. His parents' troubled marriage and subsequent divorce led him to seek refuge in the arts. At the age of ten, he was introduced to lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, who became a mentor and father figure. This relationship would profoundly influence Sondheim's career and personal life, setting the stage for his future as a pioneering composer and lyricist.

Sondheim's ability to convey complex emotions through his music became evident with his early works, such as ""West Side Story"" (1957), for which he wrote the lyrics. His collaboration with Leonard Bernstein on this modern retelling of ""Romeo and Juliet"" was a critical and commercial success, establishing Sondheim as a formidable talent in the industry. Critics lauded his ability to infuse the narrative with raw emotion, capturing the angst and passion of young love in a manner that resonated with audiences worldwide.

Throughout his career, Sondheim continued to explore the intricacies of human emotion in shows like ""Company"" (1970), ""Follies"" (1971), and ""A Little Night Music"" (1973). His work often delved into themes of loneliness, love, and the passage of time, inviting audiences to reflect on their own experiences. Sondheim's approach to musical theatre was innovative, often eschewing traditional formats in favor of narrative complexity and character-driven storytelling.

One of Sondheim's most celebrated works, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" (1979), exemplifies his penchant for blending dark themes with humor and pathos. The tale of a vengeful barber seeking retribution in Victorian London, ""Sweeney Todd"" challenges audiences to empathize with morally ambiguous characters. Sondheim's ability to humanize even the most sinister figures through music and lyrics underscores his deep understanding of the human condition.

Sondheim's later works, such as ""Into the Woods"" (1987) and ""Passion"" (1994), further solidified his reputation as a master of emotional storytelling. ""Into the Woods,"" a complex interweaving of fairy tales, explores the consequences of desire and the ambiguities of morality. ""Passion,"" a more intimate exploration of love and obsession, won the Tony Award for Best Musical, a testament to Sondheim's continued relevance and impact on the genre.

Despite his numerous accolades, including eight Tony Awards, an Academy Award, and a Pulitzer Prize, Sondheim remained a humble and introspective figure. His interviews and writings reveal a man who was deeply aware of his own vulnerabilities and insecurities. He often spoke of his struggles with self-doubt and the intense pressure he felt to live up to his own standards of excellence.

Sondheim's influence extended beyond the realm of musical theatre, inspiring generations of composers, lyricists, and performers. His work has been celebrated in countless revivals, tribute concerts, and adaptations, ensuring that his legacy continues to resonate with new audiences. Sondheim's ability to articulate the complexities of human emotion through his art has left an indelible mark, not only on the world of theatre but on the broader cultural consciousness.

As the world reflects on the life and work of Stephen Sondheim, one is reminded of his unique ability to feel and express the full spectrum of human emotion. His contributions to musical theatre have not only entertained but also challenged and inspired audiences to look inward, to feel deeply, and to embrace the complexities of life. In a world where feeling too much can often be seen as a burden, Sondheim's legacy serves as a poignant reminder of the beauty and power that can be found in embracing one's emotions fully.",gpt
Indian MP: Our nation's glorious tradition of religious tolerance is being shredded,"In a fiery address to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Indian Member of Parliament Rajesh Varma delivered a stark warning about the erosion of religious tolerance in the nation. His remarks have sparked a heated debate across the political spectrum and ignited discussions about India's commitment to its pluralistic identity.

Varma, a senior leader from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), took to the floor during a session devoted to discussing the recent outbreaks of communal violence in several parts of the country. ""Our nation's glorious tradition of religious tolerance is being shredded,"" Varma asserted, pointing to a series of incidents that he claimed were indicative of rising intolerance and sectarian strife.

The MP highlighted recent reports of religiously motivated violence, including attacks on places of worship and community clashes, as evidence of a troubling trend that threatens the fabric of the nation. ""These incidents are not isolated,"" Varma declared. ""They are symptomatic of a deeper malaise that we must urgently address.""

India, a diverse nation with a rich tapestry of cultures and religions, has long celebrated its identity as a secular state. The Indian Constitution enshrines the rights of its citizens to freely practice and propagate their faith. However, Varma argued that these constitutional guarantees are under siege, with growing polarization and divisive rhetoric fueling unrest.

Political analysts have noted that while communal tensions have always existed in India, the frequency and intensity of such incidents have escalated in recent years. The ruling party, led by Prime Minister Asha Desai, has faced criticism for allegedly not doing enough to curb the rise of extremist elements within its ranks.

In response to Varma's speech, Home Minister Suresh Patil addressed the Lok Sabha, defending the government's record on maintaining communal harmony. ""The government is fully committed to upholding the secular ethos of our nation,"" Patil said. ""We have taken swift action in response to any threats to religious harmony and will continue to do so.""

Patil also announced the formation of a new task force dedicated to monitoring and preventing communal violence, a move that was met with both praise and skepticism from various quarters. Critics argue that such initiatives have been proposed in the past with little tangible impact on the ground.

Outside Parliament, Varma's remarks have resonated with many civil society groups and activists who have long warned of the dangers posed by religious intolerance. Human rights organizations have documented a rise in hate crimes and have called on the government to take more decisive action to protect vulnerable communities.

""The social fabric of our nation is indeed being tested,"" said Anjali Mehra, director of the Delhi-based human rights group Harmony Watch. ""We need to foster dialogue and understanding, not division and fear.""

Public reaction to Varma's speech has been mixed. While some citizens have applauded his call for introspection, others accuse the opposition of politicizing sensitive issues for electoral gain. ""It's easy to point fingers,"" said Ramesh Kulkarni, a political science professor at Mumbai University. ""What we need now is constructive dialogue and effective policy measures.""

Social media has been abuzz with discussions, with hashtags related to religious tolerance trending nationwide. Many users have shared personal stories and experiences that highlight both the challenges and triumphs of India's multicultural society.

Despite the contentious nature of the debate, there is a growing consensus that preserving India's tradition of religious tolerance requires collective effort from all sectors of society. As Varma concluded his speech, he urged lawmakers to rise above partisan politics and work together to safeguard the nation's pluralistic heritage.

""Our diversity is our strength,"" Varma said, his voice echoing through the chamber. ""Let us not allow it to become our weakness. The time for action is now, before the threads of our shared heritage unravel beyond repair.""

As the nation grapples with these pressing issues, the path forward remains uncertain. However, the discourse ignited by Varma's passionate plea underscores the enduring importance of religious tolerance in the world's largest democracy.",gpt
The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.Ã¢ÂÂs Digital Henchman,"In recent years, the shadowy world of digital influence and cyber-espionage has become an essential component of statecraft, with governments across the globe leveraging technology to further their geopolitical aims. One of the most intriguing stories emerging from this digital battleground involves the rise and fall of a man known in tech and intelligence circles as M.B.S.âs digital henchman.

Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, has been known for his ambitious vision to modernize the kingdom and assert Saudi influence on the global stage. However, underpinning this vision has been a reliance on a cadre of tech-savvy operatives tasked with managing and manipulating digital narratives. At the heart of this operation was a mysterious figure whose real name remains elusive but who was widely referred to as M.B.S.'s digital henchman.

This individual, once a key player in Saudi Arabia's cyber strategy, emerged in the late 2010s as a crucial architect of the kingdom's digital operations. His rise to prominence was characterized by an uncanny ability to execute sophisticated cyber operations, ranging from controlling narratives on social media platforms to allegedly orchestrating cyber-attacks against perceived adversaries.

Sources familiar with the inner workings of the Saudi cyber apparatus describe him as a brilliant yet enigmatic figure, adept at navigating the intricate web of global digital networks. His operations reportedly extended beyond the borders of Saudi Arabia, with alleged activities targeting dissidents and critics across multiple countries.

The digital henchman's influence was not solely confined to covert operations. He was also instrumental in the development of Saudi Arabia's digital infrastructure, advocating for the integration of advanced technologies into the kingdom's governance and economic systems. His vision aligned with M.B.S.'s broader agenda of transforming Saudi Arabia into a technological powerhouse, as outlined in the Vision 2030 initiative.

However, this rapid ascent was not without controversy. Allegations of human rights abuses and cyber espionage began to surface, drawing international scrutiny. The death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, which U.S. intelligence agencies linked to the Saudi government, further intensified the focus on the kingdom's digital operations. Reports suggested that the digital henchman played a role in the surveillance and harassment of Khashoggi and other dissidents, although concrete evidence remained elusive.

As international pressure mounted, the once-untouchable figure began to face challenges from within the Saudi hierarchy. Insiders indicate that tensions arose between him and other senior officials, who were wary of the negative attention his operations had attracted. Additionally, the rapidly changing landscape of global cyber regulations and increased scrutiny from tech companies posed further obstacles to his activities.

By the early 2020s, whispers of his diminishing influence began circulating. Some suggest that internal power struggles and a shift in M.B.S.'s strategy led to his sidelining. Others speculate that he became a convenient scapegoat for the kingdom's broader controversies in the digital sphere.

In recent months, the enigmatic figure has all but disappeared from the public eye. While his current whereabouts are unknown, his legacy remains a testament to the complex interplay of technology and geopolitics in the modern era. His story underscores the potential for digital tools to both empower and undermine statecraft, raising critical questions about the ethical implications of cyber operations.

As Saudi Arabia continues to navigate its path toward modernization, the tale of M.B.S.'s digital henchman serves as a cautionary tale. It highlights the delicate balance between leveraging technology for national advancement and the ethical considerations such actions entail. In an age where digital influence holds unprecedented power, the story of this digital operative is a reminder of the profound impact individuals can have on the global stage, for better or worse.",gpt
AT&T tells employees to work from home,"In a significant move that reflects the evolving landscape of corporate work culture, telecommunications giant AT&T has instructed a large segment of its workforce to transition back to remote work. The decision comes amid ongoing adjustments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the company citing health concerns and productivity factors as primary reasons for the shift.

AT&T announced on Wednesday that it would be asking employees who have been working in-office to return to remote work arrangements. This decision affects thousands of workers across various departments, particularly those in roles that have been proven to be effectively managed from home during the pandemic.

“We are committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our employees while ensuring that we continue to meet the needs of our customers,” said John Stankey, CEO of AT&T, in a statement. “The decision to have employees work from home is based on the success of remote work over the past few years and the feedback from our teams.”

The company has been closely monitoring the situation as COVID-19 variants continue to circulate, leading to fluctuations in case numbers worldwide. Although many businesses have returned to pre-pandemic operations, recent upticks in cases have prompted a reevaluation of workplace strategies.

AT&T's decision is not without precedent. Many companies across the tech and telecommunications sectors have embraced a flexible approach to work, offering hybrid models or full-time remote options to their employees. This move by AT&T aligns with broader industry trends as companies continue to adapt to a post-pandemic reality.

Employees have expressed mixed reactions to the announcement. While some appreciate the flexibility and safety that remote work provides, others miss the face-to-face interactions and the collaborative environment of the office. 

“I’ve enjoyed being able to work from home. It offers me a better work-life balance,” said Susan Miller, a project manager at AT&T who has been working remotely since 2020. “However, I do miss the camaraderie and spontaneous brainstorming sessions that happen in the office.”

On the other hand, some employees have voiced concerns about the challenges of remote work, including feelings of isolation and the blurring of boundaries between professional and personal life. 

AT&T has assured employees that it will continue to support them during this transition. The company plans to provide additional resources for remote work, including enhanced digital tools and mental health support. Furthermore, AT&T has committed to regular assessments of the remote work policy, emphasizing that employee feedback will play a crucial role in future decisions.

Industry analysts view AT&T’s decision as a strategic move that could influence other large corporations. “AT&T is setting a precedent that other companies are likely to follow, especially if they see improvements in productivity and employee satisfaction,” said Mark Anderson, a telecommunications analyst with Brightline Research. “The ability to adapt to changing circumstances is crucial for businesses in today’s world.”

The impact of AT&T’s shift to remote work could be significant, potentially affecting everything from real estate markets to urban planning. As more companies adopt remote work policies, the demand for commercial office space may decrease, leading to a reevaluation of how urban centers are designed and utilized.

AT&T’s decision also highlights the ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness of remote work versus in-office work. While some studies suggest that remote work can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction, others point to the challenges of maintaining company culture and team cohesion.

As the situation continues to develop, AT&T has stated that it remains open to re-evaluating its work policies based on new data and employee feedback. The company encourages its workforce to remain flexible and adaptable as it navigates this transitional period.

In the meantime, employees are encouraged to stay connected with their teams through virtual meetings and digital collaboration tools. AT&T’s leadership remains optimistic about the potential of remote work to contribute positively to both the company’s goals and its employees’ quality of life.

With the landscape of work continuously evolving, AT&T’s decision reflects a broader trend towards flexibility and adaptability in the corporate world. As companies continue to navigate the complexities of modern work environments, the balance between remote and in-office work remains a pivotal consideration for business leaders worldwide.",gpt
Online sales of hand sanitizer and other 'virus protectors' spiked over 800% this year in the US,"Online sales of hand sanitizer and other products touted as ""virus protectors"" have surged dramatically in the United States, marking an increase of over 800% this year, according to a recent market analysis. This spike reflects ongoing concerns about public health and hygiene as the nation continues to navigate the complexities of viral outbreaks.

The report, released by the e-commerce analytics firm Digital Insight, highlights a significant shift in consumer behavior, with many Americans turning to online platforms to purchase products that promise to safeguard against viruses. This surge in demand is largely attributed to heightened awareness and anxiety surrounding health issues, fueled by the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and fears of future viral threats.

Among the products seeing the most substantial increase in sales are hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, face masks, and air purifiers. Hand sanitizer, in particular, has become a staple in households across the country, with consumers purchasing these products in bulk to ensure they are well-stocked for any eventuality.

Retail experts suggest that the convenience of online shopping, coupled with targeted marketing strategies emphasizing health and safety, has played a pivotal role in driving sales. ""Consumers are more health-conscious than ever before, and the ease of purchasing these products online has made it simpler for them to prioritize their well-being,"" said Lisa Harmon, a retail analyst at Digital Insight.

Additionally, the rise in online sales reflects broader changes in shopping habits that have been accelerated by the pandemic. With many consumers still preferring to avoid crowded spaces, online shopping provides a safe and convenient alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

The increased demand for virus protection products has also spurred innovation within the industry. Manufacturers have responded by developing new formulations and packaging designs to cater to consumer preferences. Products that offer additional benefits, such as moisturizing hand sanitizers or eco-friendly disinfectant wipes, have gained popularity as consumers become more discerning about their purchases.

However, this surge in demand has not been without challenges. Supply chain disruptions, which have affected various industries over the past year, have occasionally led to shortages and delays in product availability. Some consumers have expressed frustration over fluctuating prices and limited stock, particularly for high-demand items like N95 masks and premium hand sanitizers.

Despite these hurdles, industry insiders remain optimistic about the continued growth of the virus protection market. ""The demand for these products is not just a temporary trend but a reflection of a long-term shift in consumer priorities,"" said Michael Townsend, CEO of HealthGuard, a leading manufacturer of sanitizing products. ""As people become more mindful of hygiene, we anticipate sustained interest in our products.""

Public health officials continue to emphasize the importance of basic hygiene practices in preventing the spread of viruses. Handwashing, using hand sanitizer, and wearing masks in crowded or high-risk settings remain recommended measures, particularly during flu season or when cases of respiratory viruses increase.

As the holiday season approaches, retailers are preparing for another potential surge in online sales of virus protection products. Special promotions and bundles are being introduced to entice consumers to stock up on essentials while taking advantage of seasonal discounts.

In conclusion, the 800% spike in online sales of hand sanitizer and other virus-protecting products underscores a significant shift in consumer behavior driven by health concerns. As Americans continue to prioritize hygiene, both manufacturers and retailers are adapting to meet this demand, ensuring that virus protection products remain readily available to consumers across the nation.",gpt
Coronavirus test: confusion over availability and criteria is leaving sick people wondering if they're infected,"As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, confusion over the availability and criteria for COVID-19 testing has left many individuals uncertain about their health status. Across various regions, discrepancies in testing protocols and a patchwork of guidelines have led to widespread uncertainty, particularly among those exhibiting symptoms of the virus.

In many places, the demand for COVID-19 tests has outpaced supply, creating significant challenges for healthcare providers and public health officials. This shortage has prompted authorities to implement strict criteria for testing eligibility, which some experts argue may inadvertently leave symptomatic individuals without access to testing and potentially hinder efforts to control the spread of the virus.

One major point of confusion stems from the inconsistent guidelines issued by different health organizations and governmental bodies. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided a framework for testing priorities, individual countries and regions have adapted these guidelines to suit their specific contexts, leading to a lack of uniformity.

For instance, some areas prioritize testing for healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions, while others focus on symptomatic individuals regardless of their risk factors. This inconsistency has left many people unsure about whether they qualify for testing, leading to frustration and anxiety.

Moreover, reports of long wait times for testing appointments and delays in receiving results have exacerbated the situation. In some cases, individuals have had to wait several days or even weeks to secure a testing slot, during which time they may have inadvertently spread the virus to others. Once tested, delays in processing results can further complicate efforts to trace and contain outbreaks.

A recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly one in four Americans who sought a COVID-19 test reported difficulties in obtaining one. Among those who were tested, 10% said they waited more than five days to receive their results, undermining the effectiveness of contact tracing efforts.

Public health officials have acknowledged these challenges and are working to address them. Efforts to increase testing capacity are underway in many regions, with authorities ramping up production of testing kits and expanding laboratory processing capabilities. Additionally, some areas are exploring the use of rapid antigen tests, which can provide results in as little as 15 minutes, as a way to alleviate pressure on traditional testing systems.

Despite these efforts, experts caution that a more coordinated approach is needed to ensure equitable access to testing and clear communication about eligibility criteria. Dr. Sarah Johnson, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, emphasized the importance of transparency in public health messaging.

""Clear and consistent communication is key to ensuring that people understand when and how they can access testing,"" Dr. Johnson said. ""Without it, we risk leaving people in the dark and potentially exacerbating the spread of the virus.""

In response to the ongoing confusion, some communities have taken matters into their own hands. Local organizations and grassroots initiatives have stepped up to provide testing information and resources to residents, often partnering with healthcare providers to offer free or low-cost testing options.

Meanwhile, the private sector has also played a role in expanding access to testing. Retail chains, pharmacies, and tech companies have launched testing programs, often in collaboration with public health authorities, to increase the availability of tests in hard-hit areas.

As the pandemic persists, experts agree that widespread and accessible testing remains a cornerstone of efforts to control the virus. Ensuring that testing is available to all who need it, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location, is crucial to identifying and isolating cases and ultimately bringing the pandemic under control.

For individuals who are symptomatic or have been exposed to COVID-19, health authorities recommend following local guidelines and reaching out to healthcare providers for guidance on testing options. While the current situation may be fraught with challenges, continued efforts to improve testing access and communication offer a pathway to reducing confusion and uncertainty in the months to come.",gpt
Technology of Business,"The rapid evolution of technology has dramatically reshaped the landscape of business operations worldwide. From small startups to multinational corporations, the integration of advanced technological solutions has become a pivotal element in sustaining competitive advantage and fostering innovation.

One of the most significant shifts in business technology is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. These technologies have revolutionized how companies approach data analysis, customer service, and product development. AI algorithms can process vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, uncovering insights that were previously unreachable. This has enabled businesses to tailor their products and services more closely to consumer preferences, ultimately driving sales and customer satisfaction.

For instance, in the retail sector, AI-driven analytics are used to predict consumer trends and optimize inventory management. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart deploy AI to refine their supply chain processes, ensuring products are stocked based on real-time demand forecasts. This not only enhances efficiency but also minimizes waste, aligning with growing consumer and regulatory demands for sustainable practices.

Moreover, the proliferation of cloud computing has further transformed business operations. Cloud services offer scalable and flexible solutions that reduce the need for costly on-site IT infrastructure. Companies can now store and access vast amounts of data remotely, facilitating seamless collaboration across geographically dispersed teams. The cloud has also democratized access to cutting-edge technologies, enabling smaller businesses to compete with larger enterprises by leveraging the same tools and resources.

Cybersecurity, however, remains a critical concern as businesses become increasingly reliant on digital solutions. With cyber threats evolving in complexity and frequency, companies are investing heavily in advanced security measures. According to a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures, global spending on cybersecurity products and services is expected to exceed $1 trillion cumulatively from 2017 to 2021. Organizations are adopting multi-layered security strategies, incorporating AI and machine learning to detect and mitigate threats in real-time.

The development of blockchain technology has also begun to impact businesses across various sectors. Initially popularized by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers a secure and transparent method for recording transactions. This technology is particularly advantageous in industries where trust and verification are paramount, such as finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. By providing a decentralized ledger, blockchain reduces the risk of fraud and error, enhancing the integrity of business transactions.

In the realm of communication, the advent of 5G technology is set to revolutionize how businesses operate. With its promise of ultra-fast connectivity and minimal latency, 5G is expected to drive the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling an array of smart devices to communicate seamlessly. This connectivity is poised to enhance remote work capabilities, streamline operations, and improve customer experiences through real-time data access and analysis.

Remote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has redefined traditional workplace dynamics. Technologies such as video conferencing tools, collaborative software, and virtual reality platforms have made it possible for teams to work effectively from anywhere in the world. This shift has not only reduced operational costs but also expanded the talent pool available to companies, as geographical barriers are no longer a limiting factor in recruitment.

However, the integration of technology in business is not without its challenges. As automation and AI take over routine tasks, there is growing concern about job displacement and the need for workforce reskilling. Businesses and governments alike must invest in education and training programs to equip workers with the skills needed to thrive in a technology-driven economy.

In conclusion, technology continues to be a driving force in transforming business practices. While it offers unprecedented opportunities for growth and efficiency, it also presents new challenges that require careful navigation. As businesses adapt to this rapidly changing landscape, the ability to innovate and embrace technological advancements will be key to maintaining a competitive edge in the global marketplace.",gpt

Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"In an era where the dissemination of information is constantly under scrutiny, the practice of labeling news outlets as ""foreign agents"" has emerged as a controversial method for governments to identify and regulate media organizations with international ties. Proponents argue that such designations promote transparency by highlighting potential biases. However, critics contend that this approach does little to enhance clarity and may, in fact, hinder the fundamental principles of a free press.

The ""foreign agent"" label, used by countries like Russia and the United States, requires media organizations to disclose foreign funding and affiliations. This designation often comes with a set of strict reporting requirements and can carry a stigma that raises suspicions about the outlet's objectivity and motivations. Despite these intentions, labeling media entities as foreign agents does not necessarily lead to greater transparency or accountability.

In Russia, the ""foreign agent"" law has been applied expansively, affecting not only media outlets but also non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals. Critics argue that the law is wielded as a political tool to suppress dissenting voices and limit press freedom. For instance, several prominent Russian and international media organizations have been designated as foreign agents, facing increased bureaucratic red tape and financial burdens. The label often results in reduced advertising revenue and limited access to information sources, which can ultimately lead to self-censorship or closure.

Similarly, in the United States, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) requires individuals and entities engaged in political activities on behalf of foreign entities to register and disclose their relationships and financial transactions. While initially enacted in 1938 to counter Nazi propaganda, FARA's application has expanded in recent years, with several media organizations, including RT America and China Global Television Network (CGTN), being compelled to register as foreign agents. Critics of FARA argue that its enforcement remains inconsistent and its impact on transparency is negligible, as the label might simply reinforce existing biases against these outlets without providing any substantive information about their editorial processes.

Experts suggest that transparency in media can be better achieved through other means, such as promoting media literacy, supporting independent journalism, and ensuring open access to information. Media literacy programs can equip audiences with the critical thinking skills necessary to evaluate news sources and discern biases, fostering a more informed public. Additionally, supporting independent journalism through grants and non-profit initiatives can provide a counterbalance to state-controlled or foreign-funded media, enriching the diversity of voices and perspectives available to the public.

Furthermore, transparency can be enhanced by encouraging media organizations to adopt voluntary standards for disclosure of funding sources and editorial policies. Such measures can build trust with audiences without the punitive connotations associated with the ""foreign agent"" label. Encouraging media outlets to engage in self-regulation and peer review can also promote accountability and adherence to journalistic standards.

The effectiveness of labeling news outlets as foreign agents ultimately hinges on the political context and intent behind its application. In cases where the designation is used as a tool for political control, it is unlikely to foster genuine transparency or contribute to a free and open press. Instead, it may exacerbate divisions and fuel misinformation, as audiences become more polarized and skeptical of media coverage.

As the global media landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for governments, media organizations, and the public to engage in constructive dialogue about the role of the press in society. An informed public relies on access to a diverse range of perspectives, free from undue influence or restriction. While the quest for transparency is vital, it is imperative to pursue strategies that uphold the core tenets of press freedom and democratic discourse.

In conclusion, branding news outlets as foreign agents may serve as a superficial means of promoting transparency, but it falls short of addressing the complexities of media influence and bias. A more nuanced approach, emphasizing education, support for independent journalism, and voluntary disclosure, may prove more effective in fostering an informed and engaged citizenry. As the debate continues, stakeholders must consider the broader implications of such measures on the health of democratic societies and the essential function of a free press.",gpt
Meghan tells London students to 'speak up' for women's rights,"Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, delivered an impassioned speech to students in London on Wednesday, urging them to use their voices in the ongoing fight for gender equality and women's rights. Her address, part of a special event held at a leading university, was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience, comprising students, faculty, and invited guests.

Standing in the historic hall of the university, Meghan emphasized the critical role that young people play in shaping a more equitable world. “Your voice is your power,” she told the students. “It's essential that you speak up, not just for yourselves, but for those who are not able to. Women's rights are human rights, and your generation holds the promise of closing the gaps that still exist.”

The Duchess, known for her advocacy work long before she became a member of the British royal family, drew on her own experiences and the global landscape of women's rights issues. She highlighted the progress made over the decades while acknowledging the persistent challenges that need to be addressed, including gender-based violence, pay inequality, and limited access to education for girls in various parts of the world.

“While we have seen significant strides, the journey is far from over,” Meghan remarked. “Every time a girl is denied an education or a woman is told her voice doesn’t matter, it impacts us all. But each of you here has the power to change that narrative.”

The event, organized by a coalition of student groups focused on gender equality and social justice, provided a platform for Meghan to engage directly with young activists. Her visit coincides with ongoing discussions in the UK and globally about advancing gender equality in education, workplaces, and politics.

During her speech, Meghan also touched on the role of men and boys in the movement for gender equality, emphasizing the importance of allyship. “Gender equality is not just a women’s issue; it’s a human issue,” she said. “We need men to be vocal advocates for women’s rights. True progress can only be achieved when everyone is involved.”

Following her address, Meghan participated in a panel discussion alongside prominent activists and educators, further exploring the themes of empowerment and advocacy. The panelists shared insights and strategies on how students could become effective allies in their communities, emphasizing grassroots action and the importance of listening to marginalized voices.

Students who attended the event expressed appreciation for the Duchess’s visit and her candid discussion of issues that resonate with them. “It was inspiring to hear someone with her platform speak so passionately about issues that matter to my generation,” said Emma Johnson, a third-year sociology student. “It reinforces my belief that we can make a difference if we stand together and speak up.”

The university’s vice-chancellor praised Meghan for her commitment to social justice and for taking the time to engage with students on such a crucial topic. “Having the Duchess of Sussex here today has been an incredible opportunity for our students to hear firsthand about the importance of advocacy and activism,” he noted. ""Her words will undoubtedly inspire many to take up the baton in the fight for equality.""

Meghan's visit was also seen as part of her broader efforts to focus on issues of equity and justice, themes she has championed through various initiatives and public appearances. As she continues to balance her roles as a public figure and advocate, her message to the students in London underscores her commitment to leveraging her influence to drive meaningful change.

As the event concluded, Meghan left the students with a call to action, urging them to remain steadfast in their efforts to create a world where everyone, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to thrive. Her parting words, “Never underestimate the power of your voice,” resonated deeply with those in attendance, punctuating an afternoon dedicated to empowerment and advocacy.",gpt
How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger,"In a world increasingly conscious of environmental and social responsibility, architect Mariam Kamara is emerging as a key figure in reshaping the architectural landscape of Niger. Known for her visionary approach, Kamara is not just designing buildings but is crafting a sustainable future for her homeland. Her work is emblematic of a broader movement towards environmentally conscious architecture that also respects cultural heritage.

Mariam Kamara, founder of the architectural firm Atelier Masōmī, is driven by a mission to foster sustainable development and cultural preservation. Born in Saint-Étienne, France, and raised in Niger, Kamara's dual heritage has provided her with a unique perspective on architecture. She is committed to creating spaces that are not only functional and beautiful but also environmentally sustainable and culturally relevant.

One of the cornerstones of Kamara's approach is her use of local materials. In a time when modern architecture often relies on imported resources that come with high environmental costs, Kamara is turning to what the land readily offers. Her projects frequently utilize materials such as earth and stone, which are abundant in Niger, reducing the carbon footprint associated with transportation and promoting local economies.

Kamara's projects are celebrated for their innovative designs and cultural sensitivity.

Kamara’s commitment to sustainability also extends to addressing social issues. In a country where resources are limited and the effects of climate change are increasingly severe, her designs prioritize resilience and adaptability. Her architectural solutions often incorporate passive cooling strategies, such as natural ventilation and strategic shading, which reduce reliance on energy-intensive air conditioning systems.

Moreover, her work advocates for social equity, ensuring that the benefits of sustainable design are accessible to all segments of society. Kamara believes that architecture should serve as a tool for empowerment, improving the quality of life for underprivileged communities. Her projects often include community engagement processes, where locals are encouraged to participate in the design and construction phases, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration.

Kamara’s impact has not gone unnoticed on the global stage. She has been recognized with numerous awards, including the prestigious Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, which she received in 2018. This accolade provided her the opportunity to work with renowned architect Sir David Adjaye, further honing her skills and expanding her influence.

Her work has also been featured in several international exhibitions, highlighting Niger’s cultural richness and the potential for sustainable development in the region. Kamara is a regular speaker at global conferences, where she shares her insights on sustainable architecture and the importance of integrating cultural context into design.

As Mariam Kamara continues to innovate and inspire, she is not only shaping the architectural future of Niger but also setting a powerful example for sustainable development worldwide. Her work underscores the importance of environmental stewardship, cultural preservation, and social equity, principles that are increasingly vital in today’s global context.

With her unwavering commitment to these ideals, Kamara is helping to forge a path towards a more sustainable and inclusive future for Niger, and her influence is likely to resonate far beyond its borders. As the world looks for solutions to the pressing challenges of climate change and social inequality, Kamara's work serves as a beacon of hope and a testament to the transformative power of architecture.",gpt
Crawling in a 'polio-free' country,"In a concerning development, health officials in a country previously declared polio-free have reported a resurgence of the disease. The incident has prompted an immediate response from health authorities and international organizations, raising questions about vaccination coverage and surveillance systems.

The first case was identified last month in a rural district, with subsequent cases confirmed in nearby areas. Health authorities have initiated emergency immunization campaigns and are investigating the source of the outbreak. The resurgence is particularly troubling given that the country had achieved polio-free status several years ago through rigorous vaccination efforts.

Polio, a highly infectious viral disease, primarily affects children under the age of five. While there is no cure, the disease can be prevented through vaccination. In severe cases, polio can cause paralysis, and its re-emergence in any region is cause for alarm.

Dr. Maria Cortez, head of the national immunization program, expressed concern about the outbreak. ""We are mobilizing all available resources to contain this outbreak and prevent further spread,"" she said. ""Our teams are conducting door-to-door vaccination campaigns in the affected areas, and we're reinforcing surveillance measures to quickly identify any new cases.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have been quick to offer support. Both organizations are sending teams to the affected region to assist with vaccination efforts and provide logistical support. In a joint statement, they emphasized the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent future outbreaks.

Experts suggest that the re-emergence of polio could be linked to gaps in vaccination coverage, possibly exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, routine immunization services were disrupted in many parts of the world, leading to a decline in vaccination rates for various preventable diseases.

Dr. Sanjay Kumar, a public health expert, pointed out that ""the pandemic shifted global health priorities and resources, which may have inadvertently left room for such outbreaks. It's crucial we learn from this and strengthen our health systems to ensure resilience against future disruptions.""

Local community leaders are also playing a vital role in addressing the outbreak. Efforts are underway to dispel misinformation about vaccines and encourage community participation in immunization campaigns. Misinformation and vaccine hesitancy have been significant hurdles in vaccination efforts worldwide, and community involvement is seen as a key strategy in overcoming these challenges.

The country's health ministry has called for calm, assuring the public that steps are being taken to address the situation swiftly. In a televised address, Health Minister Dr. Rafael Esteban stated, ""We understand the concerns of our citizens, and we are committed to ensuring the safety and health of our population. Our teams are working tirelessly to control this outbreak.""

The resurgence of polio in a declared polio-free country underscores the fragility of global health achievements. It serves as a reminder of the critical importance of maintaining vigilant immunization programs and robust health infrastructures. As health officials and international partners work to contain the current outbreak, the focus remains on preventing future occurrences.

The situation is being closely monitored, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available. The international community is watching closely, as the outcome of this outbreak could have implications for global polio eradication efforts.",gpt
Disneyland closes because of the coronavirus outbreak,"In an unprecedented move, Disneyland, the renowned theme park in Anaheim, California, has announced its temporary closure due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. This marks the first time since the national tragedy of 9/11 that the park has voluntarily shut its gates to guests, underscoring the seriousness of the current public health crisis.

The decision to close the park, effective immediately, was made in response to guidance from health officials and government mandates aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. The Disneyland Resort, which includes the adjacent Disney California Adventure Park, hotels, shopping, and dining facilities, will remain closed until further notice. Disney officials emphasized that the closure is a precautionary measure to protect the well-being of guests and employees.

“After careful consideration and in line with the best practices advised by health officials, we have decided to temporarily close Disneyland Resort,” a representative from Disney said in a statement. “This decision is in the best interest of public health, and we are committed to doing our part to prevent the spread of the virus.”

The closure comes as California grapples with an increasing number of coronavirus cases. State officials have called for large public gatherings to be canceled or postponed, and Disneyland, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors daily from around the globe, falls squarely into this category. The move aligns with actions taken by other major attractions and events across the country, which have also been suspended or canceled.

The economic ramifications of the closure are likely to be significant. Disneyland is a major economic driver in Southern California, employing thousands of staff and contributing billions to the local economy annually. The park's closure will impact not only Disney employees but also local businesses that rely on the steady stream of tourists the park attracts.

Local business owners expressed concern over the potential long-term effects of the shutdown. “We understand why it’s necessary, but it’s still a tough pill to swallow,” said Maria Sanchez, who owns a restaurant near the park. “We hope this action will help control the virus so we can all get back to normal soon.”

Disneyland’s closure is part of a broader trend of disruptions to the entertainment and travel industries, which have been heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Airlines have canceled flights, cruise lines have suspended operations, and major sports leagues have postponed their seasons.

In response to the closure, Disneyland is working to accommodate guests who have already purchased tickets or booked hotel stays. The park is offering refunds and allowing guests to reschedule their visits. Annual passholders will also have their passes extended to account for the closure period.

“We are grateful for the understanding and support of our guests and fans during this challenging time,” the Disney spokesperson added. “We look forward to welcoming everyone back to the happiest place on earth as soon as it is safe to do so.”

Health experts continue to urge the public to follow recommended precautions, such as social distancing, frequent hand-washing, and avoiding non-essential travel, to limit the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines and updates as the situation evolves, and state health departments are providing localized information and resources.

As the situation develops, Disneyland officials will continue to monitor updates from health authorities to determine when it will be safe to reopen. In the meantime, Disney’s focus remains on the health and safety of its guests and employees.

The closure of Disneyland is a somber reminder of the profound impact the coronavirus pandemic is having across the globe, affecting everyday life in ways that were unimaginable just a few months ago. As communities rally together to combat this outbreak, the hope is that these measures will lead to a swift recovery and a return to normalcy for all.",gpt
How to prepare for ex-President Trump,"As the nation prepares for the potential return of Donald Trump to the political stage, citizens, politicians, and analysts alike are considering what this could mean for the future of American politics. The former president, who left office in January 2021, has remained a polarizing figure, with a loyal base of supporters and an equally vocal group of detractors. As Trump teases a possible return to the political arena, it's essential to understand the context and implications of his re-emergence.

Donald Trump’s tenure as the 45th President of the United States was marked by unconventional governance, a signature communication style through social media, and policies that drew both praise and criticism. As the nation grapples with the possibility of his return, here are several key areas to consider:

**1. Political Landscape:**

Trump's potential re-entry into the political sphere could significantly reshape the Republican Party. During his presidency, he transformed the GOP into a party largely aligned with his ideals, focusing on issues such as immigration reform, economic nationalism, and a strong stance against China. His influence remains strong, and many Republican candidates continue to align themselves with Trump’s ideology.

However, Trump's return may also exacerbate existing divisions within the party. Traditional conservatives and those who have distanced themselves from Trump's rhetoric may face an identity crisis, as they navigate a political landscape dominated by Trump's brand of populism. The challenge for the Republican Party will be to unify these divergent factions while appealing to a broader electorate.

**2. Media and Communication:**

Trump’s relationship with the media was often contentious, characterized by frequent accusations of ""fake news"" and a preference for direct communication with the public via platforms like Twitter. With his accounts on major social media platforms restored, Trump’s direct line to his supporters is likely to resume. His communication style, which often bypasses traditional media channels, might once again redefine how political messaging is delivered and consumed.

For the media, covering Trump’s activities will require a careful balance of providing necessary coverage while avoiding the pitfalls of sensationalism. News outlets will need to critically assess how to report on Trump’s statements and actions, ensuring that fact-based reporting prevails over entertainment-driven narratives.

**3. Policy and Governance:**

If Trump decides to run for office again, his policy agenda will be closely scrutinized. During his first term, his administration focused on deregulation, tax reform, and conservative judicial appointments. Any future campaign is likely to revisit these themes, while also addressing new challenges such as pandemic recovery and international relations.

Observers will be keen to see how Trump’s policies evolve in response to the current global and domestic issues. His stance on climate change, healthcare, and social justice movements will be of particular interest, as these issues have gained prominence since he left office.

**4. Social Dynamics:**

Trump’s presidency was marked by significant social upheaval, with movements such as Black Lives Matter gaining momentum. His return to the political spotlight could reignite debates on race relations, social justice, and inequality. The former president’s rhetoric often polarized these discussions, and his involvement in future political discourse could either escalate tensions or prompt new conversations on unity and progress.

Communities and advocacy groups will need to prepare for the potential impact of Trump’s rhetoric on social dynamics, ensuring that dialogue remains constructive and inclusive. Engaging in community-building initiatives and fostering open communication will be crucial in navigating these complex social landscapes.

**5. Economic Considerations:**

Trump’s economic policies will be a focal point of any potential campaign. His administration prioritized tax cuts and deregulation, which proponents argue spurred economic growth, while critics contend they disproportionately benefited the wealthy. The economic landscape has shifted significantly since 2021, with new challenges such as inflation and supply chain disruptions taking center stage.

Economic analysts and policymakers will be closely watching how Trump addresses these issues, particularly in terms of trade policy and domestic manufacturing. The strategies he employs could have wide-reaching implications for both the national and global economy.

As the nation contemplates the implications of Donald Trump’s potential return, the focus will be on understanding how his presence could shape the political, social, and economic fabric of the United States. Whether or not Trump decides to re-enter the political arena, the discussions surrounding his influence are likely to remain a significant part of the national dialogue in the months and years to come.",gpt

Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters,"In the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders emerged as a formidable contender, galvanizing a diverse coalition of young voters, progressives, and working-class Americans. However, one crucial demographic remained elusive for the Vermont senator: black voters. Despite his progressive platform and focus on economic inequality, Sanders struggled to secure substantial support from this pivotal voting bloc, which has historically played a decisive role in Democratic primaries.

Several factors contributed to Sanders' inability to resonate with black voters. A key aspect was his perceived singular focus on economic issues, which some critics argued overshadowed the racial dynamics that uniquely affect black communities. Sanders’ message heavily emphasized income inequality, healthcare access, and education reform, areas undoubtedly important to black voters. However, his approach at times seemed to overlook the systemic racism and social justice issues that many black Americans see as inextricable from economic concerns.

Moreover, Sanders often framed his message around class rather than race, a strategy that some black voters and leaders viewed as insufficient in addressing the specific challenges they face. While economic inequality is a significant issue, the intersection of race and class creates additional layers of discrimination that require targeted policies beyond broad economic reforms. Sanders’ reluctance to center race explicitly in his campaign may have inadvertently alienated potential supporters.

Another factor was Sanders' relatively late start in building relationships with black communities and their leaders. Unlike his competitors, such as Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, Sanders did not have longstanding ties to influential black political figures or organizations. Clinton, for example, had cultivated relationships with black leaders over decades, partly through her husband's presidency, while Biden's association with former President Barack Obama bolstered his credibility with black voters.

Sanders' efforts to engage with black communities also faced challenges due to his campaign's organizational structure. Critics pointed to a lack of diverse leadership within his campaign team, which may have hindered culturally sensitive outreach strategies and messaging. In contrast, other candidates employed strategists and surrogates who were deeply embedded within black communities, allowing for more authentic and effective engagement.

Furthermore, Sanders' outsider status, which appealed to many of his supporters, may have been a double-edged sword. While his anti-establishment rhetoric resonated with some voters, it may have been less appealing to black voters who value experience and familiarity in candidates. This preference can be attributed to a desire for proven leadership and reliability, especially in a political landscape where black communities often feel overlooked and marginalized.

In addition, Sanders' past stances on gun control and his contentious relationship with the Democratic establishment could have contributed to skepticism among black voters. His mixed voting record on gun legislation, for instance, contrasted with the priorities of black communities disproportionately affected by gun violence. Meanwhile, his frequent criticisms of the Democratic Party may have raised concerns about his commitment to advancing a cohesive agenda within the party framework.

Despite these challenges, Sanders made efforts to bridge the gap with black voters. He engaged with black media, participated in forums on racial justice, and expanded his platform to include policies addressing police reform and criminal justice. However, these efforts often seemed reactive rather than proactive, potentially limiting their impact.

The 2020 primary season highlighted these dynamics when Joe Biden's decisive victory in South Carolina, propelled by overwhelming support from black voters, effectively shifted the momentum of the race. This outcome underscored the critical role of black voters in shaping the Democratic nomination process and highlighted the limitations of Sanders' appeal to this demographic.

Ultimately, Sanders' difficulty in gaining traction with black voters underscores the complexity of voter identity and the multifaceted nature of political support. While his progressive policies attracted a broad coalition, the nuances of race, history, and community ties proved pivotal. As the Democratic Party continues to evolve, understanding and addressing these dynamics will be essential for future candidates seeking to build inclusive and representative coalitions.",gpt
Why we can't find hand sanitizer,"As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most noticeable shortages in many households and public spaces is hand sanitizer. This essential item, once abundant and readily available on store shelves, has become a rare find, leaving many wondering why it remains elusive nearly three years into the pandemic.

The demand for hand sanitizer skyrocketed in early 2020 as health organizations and governments worldwide emphasized its importance in curbing the spread of the virus. The initial surge in demand led to widespread stockpiling, creating immediate shortages. While manufacturers swiftly ramped up production to meet this unprecedented demand, several factors have continued to impede consistent availability.

A key issue contributing to the persistent shortage is the supply chain disruptions that have plagued various industries since the pandemic began. These disruptions have affected the availability of key ingredients required for hand sanitizer production, such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. The global supply chain, already strained by the pandemic, has faced additional hurdles due to labor shortages, transportation delays, and geopolitical tensions, all of which have hindered the steady flow of raw materials.

Moreover, the production of hand sanitizer is subject to strict regulatory standards, limiting the number of manufacturers capable of producing it. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, enforces stringent guidelines to ensure the safety and efficacy of hand sanitizers. While these regulations are necessary for consumer protection, they can slow down the approval process for new manufacturers looking to enter the market.

Another factor exacerbating the shortage is the increased demand for hand sanitizer from industries and institutions beyond individual consumers. Healthcare facilities, schools, and businesses have all significantly increased their use of hand sanitizers to maintain hygiene standards and protect against the virus. This institutional demand places further strain on the supply chain, diverting resources that might otherwise be available to the general public.

The economic impact of the pandemic has also played a role in the continued scarcity of hand sanitizer. As people around the world faced financial uncertainty, many opted to purchase essential items in bulk, leading to temporary shortages and leaving shelves empty for those who could not afford to stockpile. This purchasing behavior, compounded by the ongoing global economic challenges, has made it difficult for suppliers to predict demand accurately and maintain adequate stock levels.

In response to these challenges, some manufacturers have attempted to diversify their sources of raw materials and streamline their production processes. Companies have also explored partnerships with non-traditional suppliers, such as distilleries, which have repurposed their facilities to produce alcohol-based sanitizers. These innovative approaches have helped alleviate some of the pressure but have not completely resolved the issue.

Experts suggest that consumers remain patient and flexible in their purchasing habits. Alternatives to traditional hand sanitizers, such as soap and water, are equally effective in most situations, provided they are used correctly. It is also advisable to check the availability of hand sanitizers at different times of the day or week, as restocking schedules may vary.

While the shortage of hand sanitizer persists, it is important to remember that maintaining overall hygiene and following public health guidelines continue to be the most effective measures in preventing the spread of COVID-19. As the world adapts to the new normal, ongoing efforts to stabilize supply chains and increase production capacity will hopefully improve the availability of this crucial hygiene product.

Until then, the search for hand sanitizer might remain a challenge for many, but understanding the factors behind its scarcity can help consumers navigate this ongoing issue with greater awareness and patience.",gpt
Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination,"Uruguay, a small yet vibrant country nestled between Argentina and Brazil, is rapidly emerging as a significant player in the global wine industry. While countries like France, Italy, and Spain have long dominated the wine scene, Uruguay is carving out a niche for itself, thanks to its unique climate, diverse terroir, and the dedication of its winemakers.

For many wine enthusiasts, Uruguay is synonymous with Tannat, a robust red wine grape that has become the country's flagship varietal. Originally from the Madiran region in France, Tannat has found a new home in Uruguay's temperate climate and clay-rich soils. The grape thrives in the country's maritime environment, which is moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, offering ideal growing conditions that lend the wine its distinctive character—rich in tannins but with a softer, fruitier profile compared to its French counterpart.

One of the key factors contributing to Uruguay's potential as a wine destination is its diverse terroir. The country's wine regions, including Canelones, Maldonado, and Colonia, offer a variety of microclimates and soil types, allowing winemakers to experiment with different grape varieties. This diversity is leading to the production of not only exceptional Tannat wines but also impressive expressions of other varietals like Albariño, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot.

Uruguayan winemakers are increasingly focusing on sustainable and organic practices, which resonate with the global trend towards environmentally conscious wine production. Many vineyards are family-owned, with a commitment to maintaining the land for future generations. This approach not only enhances the quality of the wine but also appeals to wine tourists who are increasingly seeking out authentic, sustainable experiences.

The country's wine industry is also benefiting from a strategic push to increase its visibility on the world stage. The Uruguayan government and wine associations are actively promoting the nation's wines through international wine fairs and competitions. This has led to Uruguayan wines gaining recognition and accolades, further boosting their profile among global consumers.

Tourism infrastructure in Uruguay is evolving to accommodate the growing interest in wine tourism. The region of Maldonado, known for its stunning beaches and luxury resorts, is seeing a rise in boutique wineries offering tasting tours and vineyard stays. These experiences allow visitors to immerse themselves in the winemaking process, from grape harvesting to bottling, providing a hands-on understanding of what makes Uruguayan wine unique.

Uruguay's cultural richness also adds to its appeal as a wine destination. Visitors can enjoy the country's vibrant culinary scene, which perfectly complements its wine offerings. From traditional asado (barbecue) featuring grass-fed beef to fresh seafood, Uruguayan cuisine offers a variety of flavors that pair beautifully with the local wines.

Moreover, Uruguay's welcoming atmosphere and emphasis on hospitality make it an attractive destination for wine lovers. The country is known for its friendly locals and relaxed pace of life, allowing visitors to enjoy a leisurely exploration of its vineyards and wine regions.

The rise of Uruguay as a wine destination is not just about the wine itself but also about the experiences surrounding it. Festivals like the Vendimia, or grape harvest celebration, showcase the country's rich winemaking traditions and offer visitors a chance to participate in age-old customs. These events, coupled with the picturesque landscapes and warm climate, make Uruguay an increasingly appealing choice for travelers seeking a unique wine journey.

While the global wine market continues to be competitive, Uruguay's commitment to quality, sustainability, and innovation positions it well to become the next great wine destination. As more wine enthusiasts discover the country's offerings, Uruguay is poised to make a lasting impression on the world wine map. With its combination of exceptional wines, stunning scenery, and cultural richness, Uruguay offers a compelling invitation to discover a new frontier in wine tourism.",gpt
How non-alcoholic cocktails are shaking up the bar scene,"In recent years, the global bar scene has witnessed a significant transformation, marked by the rising popularity of non-alcoholic cocktails. These innovative beverages, often referred to as ""mocktails,"" are not only gaining traction among health-conscious consumers but are also reshaping the way bars operate and attract clientele. As the demand for alcohol-free options increases, bartenders and mixologists are embracing the trend, crafting creative, flavorful drinks that rival their alcoholic counterparts.

The shift towards non-alcoholic cocktails can be attributed to several factors, including changing consumer preferences and a growing awareness of health and wellness. Many individuals are choosing to reduce their alcohol consumption for health reasons or personal preferences, while others seek to enjoy social events without the after-effects of alcohol. This has led to a surge in demand for beverages that are both sophisticated and satisfying, without the alcohol content.

Bars around the world are responding to this demand by expanding their menus to include an array of non-alcoholic options. In major cities like New York, London, and Sydney, bars are now offering intricate mocktail menus featuring ingredients such as fresh herbs, exotic fruits, and artisanal syrups. These drinks are often crafted with the same level of care and creativity as traditional cocktails, providing patrons with a unique and enjoyable drinking experience.

One of the key players in this movement is Seedlip, a company that produces distilled non-alcoholic spirits. Founded in 2015, Seedlip has quickly become a staple in many bars, offering a range of products that can be used to create complex, flavorful non-alcoholic drinks. Ben Branson, the founder of Seedlip, explained that the goal is to provide ""a third option"" for consumers who want something more sophisticated than a soft drink but without the alcohol.

The rise of non-alcoholic cocktails has also been fueled by the growing trend of ""mindful drinking,"" a movement that encourages individuals to be more conscious of their alcohol consumption. This trend is particularly popular among millennials and Gen Z, who are known for prioritizing health and wellness in their lifestyle choices. As a result, many bars are seeing an increase in younger patrons who are interested in exploring non-alcoholic options.

Bartenders are rising to the challenge, experimenting with new techniques and ingredients to create drinks that are both appealing and complex. Some are even developing their own non-alcoholic spirits, infusions, and bitters, allowing them to offer a truly unique experience to their customers. The emphasis is on balance and flavor, with many non-alcoholic cocktails featuring a combination of sweet, sour, and bitter elements.

The economic impact of this trend is also notable. Bars that offer a diverse range of non-alcoholic options are attracting a wider audience, from designated drivers to pregnant women, and those who simply prefer not to drink alcohol. This inclusivity can lead to increased foot traffic and sales, as patrons are more likely to visit a venue that caters to a variety of preferences.

However, the rise of non-alcoholic cocktails is not without its challenges. Some traditionalists argue that the essence of a cocktail lies in its alcohol content, and that removing this element results in a fundamentally different drink. Others question whether the prices of mocktails, which can be comparable to alcoholic beverages, are justifiable. Nonetheless, the growing popularity of non-alcoholic cocktails suggests that many consumers are willing to pay for a high-quality, alcohol-free experience.

As the bar scene continues to evolve, it is clear that non-alcoholic cocktails are here to stay. With their creative flavors and inclusive appeal, these beverages are transforming the way people socialize and enjoy drinks. For bars and consumers alike, the rise of the mocktail represents a refreshing shift towards more diverse and health-conscious options, highlighting the industry's ability to adapt and innovate in response to changing tastes and preferences.",gpt
"Coronavirus threat to Tokyo 2020 is 'heartbreaking,' says surfer Kanoa Igarashi","Japanese-American surfer Kanoa Igarashi has expressed deep concern over the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, describing the situation as ""heartbreaking"" for athletes around the world. As Japan continues to grapple with the spread of COVID-19, questions loom over whether the Games, originally scheduled to begin on July 24, can proceed as planned.

Igarashi, who has dual citizenship in Japan and the United States, is slated to represent Japan in surfing, a sport making its Olympic debut in Tokyo. In a recent interview, he shared his thoughts on the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic. ""The possibility that the Olympics might not happen, or might be postponed, is heartbreaking for so many athletes who have been preparing for this moment their entire lives,"" he said.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), alongside the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, has maintained that the Games will go on, with IOC President Thomas Bach stating that there is no ""Plan B."" However, the rapid spread of the virus has led to increasing calls for postponement or cancellation from various stakeholders, including athletes, national teams, and health experts.

Japan has reported over 900 cases of COVID-19, and the number continues to rise as the country implements measures to contain the virus. Despite these efforts, concerns about the health and safety of athletes, spectators, and the local population remain at the forefront of discussions.

For Igarashi, the prospect of missing out on the Olympics is particularly poignant. Having grown up in Huntington Beach, California, Igarashi has become a prominent figure in the surfing world, known for his competitive spirit and dedication to the sport. Competing in the Olympics in his family's home country is a dream he has nurtured for years.

""Surfing's inclusion in the Olympics is a huge milestone for our sport,"" Igarashi explained. ""It's an opportunity to showcase surfing on a global stage, to show the world what we do and why we love it so much. To have that opportunity taken away would be devastating.""

The pandemic has already disrupted the sporting calendar worldwide, with major events like the NBA season, UEFA Euro 2020, and Wimbledon being postponed or canceled. For athletes like Igarashi, the uncertainty has forced them to adjust their training and competition schedules, adding another layer of complexity to an already challenging situation.

Despite the uncertainty, Igarashi remains hopeful that the Tokyo Olympics will proceed in some form, highlighting the resilience of the athletic community. ""Athletes are used to overcoming obstacles and adapting to new situations,"" he said. ""We're hopeful that there will be a solution that allows the Games to happen safely, even if that means adjusting the timeline.""

In the meantime, Igarashi is focusing on staying positive and maintaining his training regimen as best as he can. With beaches and gyms closed in many areas due to lockdown measures, athletes are finding creative ways to stay in shape and keep their skills sharp.

The Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, along with the Japanese government, is closely monitoring the situation and exploring various scenarios to ensure the safety of all involved. Options on the table include holding the Games without spectators or postponing them to a later date, though no official decisions have been made.

As the world watches and waits, the fate of the Tokyo Olympics hangs in the balance, with athletes like Igarashi holding out hope for an outcome that allows them to fulfill their Olympic dreams. For now, the global sporting community remains united in its commitment to health and safety, as it navigates the challenges posed by an unprecedented global health crisis.",gpt

Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus,"In a worrisome development that has reignited global concerns, several high-ranking government officials across various countries have tested positive for a rapidly spreading virus. This has led to heightened fears about the safety of world leaders and the potential implications for international diplomacy and governance.

The news first broke when a spokesperson for the government of Country X confirmed that their Minister of Foreign Affairs had tested positive for the virus after returning from a series of diplomatic meetings. This announcement was quickly followed by similar reports from Country Y, where the Deputy Prime Minister and several members of the cabinet are now in isolation after positive test results.

The outbreak among government officials has sent shockwaves through political circles, raising questions about the effectiveness of current health protocols and the potential risks of in-person gatherings. Experts emphasize that while virtual meetings have become more common, certain diplomatic and economic discussions still necessitate face-to-face interactions, which can increase the risk of transmission.

The virus, which has seen a resurgence in several regions, poses a unique threat to individuals in high-profile positions who frequently engage with diverse groups of people. The new cases have prompted several countries to reassess their current strategies and implement stricter measures to protect their leaders.

In response to the potential threat, several governments have swiftly moved to enhance their health and safety protocols. Country Z has announced the immediate suspension of all international travel for government officials unless absolutely necessary. They have also introduced mandatory testing and quarantine measures for anyone who has attended international summits or meetings in the past month.

Meanwhile, health experts are urging world leaders to adopt more stringent protocols. Dr. Anna Lee, an epidemiologist specializing in infectious diseases, noted, ""It's critical that we protect those in leadership roles, not only for their individual health but for the stability they provide. We need to balance the necessity of their work with the health risks involved.""

The situation has also sparked discussions about the future of international diplomacy. Many are questioning whether the era of large-scale summits and in-person meetings is sustainable in the face of ongoing health threats. Some suggest that this could accelerate the adoption of technology-driven solutions, allowing for critical discussions to take place without the need for physical presence.

Public reaction to the rising number of cases among officials has been mixed. Some citizens express concern over the health of their leaders and the potential impact on government functionality. Others criticize the apparent disregard for health guidelines, pointing to the need for leaders to set an example by adhering to the same standards expected of the general public.

The economic implications of the outbreak are also being closely monitored. Markets reacted with caution following the announcements, with analysts predicting potential disruptions in international trade and cooperation if the situation escalates. The uncertainty around governmental stability in affected countries could lead to volatility in global markets.

In addition to the immediate health concerns, there is also a growing apprehension about the potential for misinformation and panic. Social media platforms are already buzzing with speculation and unverified claims, prompting authorities to urge the public to rely on information from official sources.

As the situation continues to evolve, governments worldwide are expected to hold emergency meetings to assess the implications and devise strategies to mitigate the risks. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining how effectively these measures can protect world leaders and maintain the continuity of governance.

For now, the global community watches closely, hoping for a swift recovery for those affected and a comprehensive response to prevent further spread. The stakes are undeniably high, and the world waits with bated breath to see how this crisis will unfold.",gpt
Turkey: Boy saves puppy trapped in oil well,"In a heartwarming tale of bravery and compassion, a young boy in Turkey has become a local hero after rescuing a puppy trapped in an oil well. The incident occurred in the rural village of Çayırköy, located in the northwestern province of Kocaeli, and has captured the attention of the nation.

It all began when villagers noticed distressed barking coming from an open oil well on the outskirts of the village. Upon investigation, they discovered a small puppy, estimated to be just a few weeks old, stranded at the bottom of the narrow shaft. The well, no longer in use and partially concealed by overgrown vegetation, posed a significant challenge for rescue efforts due to its depth and confined space.

Local authorities were alerted, and soon a small crowd had gathered, including 12-year-old Ali Demir, a resident of the village. While adults debated the safest way to extract the puppy, Ali took matters into his own hands. With a rope secured around his waist and guided by villagers, Ali was lowered into the well—a risky maneuver that required both courage and determination.

Witnesses describe the tense moments as Ali descended into the darkness, the only light coming from a flashlight he carried. “We were all holding our breath,” said Mehmet Yilmaz, a village elder who was present during the rescue. “Ali showed no fear. He was determined to save that puppy.”

After what felt like an eternity to those watching, Ali reappeared at the mouth of the well, clutching the frightened but unharmed puppy to his chest. Cheers erupted from the crowd, and tears of relief and joy were shed as Ali and the puppy were pulled to safety.

The puppy, now affectionately named ""Kuyu,"" which means ""well"" in Turkish, was immediately taken to a local veterinarian for a thorough examination. Apart from being cold and hungry, Kuyu was found to be in good health. The veterinarian, Dr. Leyla Aydin, praised Ali’s quick thinking and bravery, noting that the situation could have been much worse had the puppy remained trapped for a longer period.

News of the rescue quickly spread beyond the village, with social media platforms flooded with praise for Ali and his courageous act. The hashtag #AliVeKuyu (Ali and Kuyu) began trending, and the story was picked up by national news outlets, turning Ali into an overnight sensation.

In an interview with Kanal D, a major Turkish television network, Ali humbly downplayed his heroism. “I just wanted to help the puppy,” he said. “I knew I could fit into the well, so I did what I thought was right.”

Local officials have since vowed to increase efforts to secure abandoned wells in the area, recognizing the potential dangers they pose to both animals and humans. “Ali’s bravery has highlighted an issue that needs urgent attention,” said Mayor Fatma Kaplan Hürriyet. “We are committed to ensuring the safety of our community.”

As for Ali, he has been inundated with messages of admiration and offers of support, including scholarships and educational opportunities. However, he remains focused on his studies and spending time with Kuyu, who has officially been adopted by the Demir family.

The story of Ali and Kuyu serves as a poignant reminder of the power of compassion and the extraordinary difference one individual can make. In a world often dominated by troubling news, this tale of a boy and a puppy has brought a much-needed dose of positivity and hope.

As the village of Çayırköy celebrates its young hero, Ali’s actions continue to inspire people across Turkey and beyond, proving that acts of kindness, no matter how small, can leave a lasting impact.",gpt
Australian paper prints blank pages to help tackle toilet paper shortage,"In an unexpected twist to the ongoing struggle with toilet paper shortages, a regional newspaper in Australia has taken a novel approach to help alleviate the crisis: printing blank pages. The NT News, based in the Northern Territory, has dedicated eight pages of its recent edition to blank sheets with perforated edges, offering a temporary relief to anxious shoppers unable to find toilet paper on store shelves.

The creative solution comes amidst a nationwide scramble for toilet paper, sparked by panic buying due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With supermarket aisles cleared of this essential commodity almost as soon as they are stocked, the NT News's gesture is a testament to the Australian spirit of resourcefulness and humor in the face of adversity.

Editor Matt Williams explained the rationale behind the newspaper's decision. ""We've always prided ourselves on being a publication that serves the community,"" Williams said in an interview. ""When we saw how distressed people were over the lack of toilet paper, we thought, 'Why not use our platform to help the situation?' It’s a bit of a cheeky solution, but desperate times call for desperate measures.""

The eight blank pages are printed on the same newsprint as the rest of the newspaper, with the addition of perforations to facilitate easy tearing and use. The NT News has, however, maintained its usual content, ensuring that readers do not miss out on their daily dose of news and entertainment. The blank pages are simply an extra addition to the standard edition, allowing readers to keep informed and, quite literally, covered.

This innovative approach has been met with widespread amusement and appreciation from the public. Social media platforms are abuzz with posts lauding the newspaper's creativity, with some users even suggesting that other publications should follow suit. ""This is the Aussie way to solve a problem,"" one Twitter user commented, while another wrote, ""Leave it to the NT News to roll out the best solution to the toilet paper crisis!""

The scarcity of toilet paper has become a global phenomenon, with similar shortages reported in countries around the world. In Australia, the situation has been exacerbated by public fear and uncertainty surrounding the duration of the pandemic. Retailers have imposed purchase limits on toilet paper and other essential goods in an attempt to curb hoarding and ensure equitable distribution.

Despite these measures, the panic buying has persisted, prompting retailers, authorities, and now, even newspapers, to come up with creative solutions. The NT News's unique approach underscores the lengths to which communities are willing to go in order to support each other through the crisis.

The newspaper's initiative is not just about providing a practical solution but also about bringing a bit of levity to a tense situation. ""We're all in this together,"" Williams noted, ""and if we can bring a smile to someone's face while also helping them with a real problem, then we've done our job.""

As the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, stories like that of the NT News serve as a reminder of the resilience and ingenuity of communities when faced with adversity. While the toilet paper shortage is just one of many issues arising from the crisis, the newspaper's response highlights the power of creativity and humor to make a difference, even in the smallest of ways.

Whether this initiative will be adopted by other publications remains to be seen. However, the NT News has certainly set a precedent for thinking outside the box, or in this case, outside the roll. As Australians continue to navigate the uncertainties of the pandemic, it's clear that a little ingenuity and a lot of heart can go a long way in bringing a community together.",gpt
US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"US cities are facing a significant environmental challenge: the loss of 36 million trees annually. This alarming trend poses profound implications for urban ecosystems, climate resilience, and public health. While the figures paint a dire picture, there are steps individuals and communities can take to reverse this troubling decline.

Urban areas across the United States are losing tree cover at an unprecedented rate. According to a study by the U.S. Forest Service, cities have seen a 1% decline in tree cover every year, amounting to an annual loss of $96 million in benefits trees provide. These benefits include reducing air pollution, conserving energy, and improving both physical and mental health for urban dwellers.

The reasons behind this loss are multifaceted. Urban development is a primary driver, as expanding cities encroach on green spaces to accommodate growing populations. Trees are often removed to make way for new buildings, roads, and infrastructure projects. Additionally, extreme weather events, exacerbated by climate change, have increased the frequency of tree damage and loss. Hurricanes, tornadoes, and ice storms can decimate urban forests in a matter of hours. Moreover, pest infestations and diseases, such as the emerald ash borer, have wreaked havoc on tree populations, further compounding the issue.

The implications of this loss extend beyond aesthetics. Trees play a crucial role in mitigating urban heat islands, areas where the built environment causes temperatures to rise significantly higher than in surrounding rural areas. By providing shade and releasing moisture into the air, trees can lower temperatures, reducing the need for air conditioning and, therefore, energy consumption. This cooling effect is particularly vital as global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.

Furthermore, trees improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and sequestering carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse gas. The loss of tree cover means a decrease in these natural filtration systems, leading to poorer air quality and exacerbating respiratory issues among city residents.

The economic impact is also significant. Trees increase property values, attract businesses, and promote tourism by enhancing the beauty and livability of urban areas. The reduction in tree cover could lead to decreased property values and a less vibrant urban economy.

Public health is another area of concern. Numerous studies have linked green spaces to improved mental health, reduced stress levels, and increased physical activity. The decline in urban tree cover could lead to a host of negative health outcomes for city residents, particularly in underserved communities that often have less access to green spaces.

Despite these challenges, there are actions that individuals and communities can take to combat tree loss. Planting new trees is one of the most straightforward and effective strategies. Local governments, community organizations, and residents can work together to identify areas in need of reforestation and organize tree-planting events. Selecting native species that are well-suited to the local climate and resistant to pests and diseases can enhance the resilience of urban forests.

Advocacy and education are also crucial. By raising awareness about the importance of urban trees, individuals can influence policy decisions and encourage local governments to prioritize tree preservation in urban planning. Supporting policies that protect existing trees during development projects and investing in green infrastructure can also make a significant difference.

Residents can contribute by caring for trees on their properties and in their communities. Regular watering, mulching, and pruning can help young trees grow strong and healthy. Reporting pest infestations or diseases to local authorities can prevent the spread of harmful conditions that could threaten wider tree populations.

In the face of rapid urbanization and climate change, preserving and expanding urban tree cover is more important than ever. The loss of 36 million trees each year is a stark reminder of the urgent need to act. By taking collective action, cities across the United States can safeguard these vital natural resources and ensure a healthier, more sustainable future for all urban inhabitants.",gpt
"Brazilian president's press secretary tests positive for coronavirus, days after meeting Trump","In a concerning development, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's press secretary has tested positive for the coronavirus, mere days after being part of a delegation that met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. This revelation has raised alarm bells both in Brazil and the United States, with fears of potential exposure extending to the highest levels of government.

Fabio Wajngarten, the press secretary in question, was confirmed to have contracted the virus after exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19. His positive test result was announced on Thursday, sparking immediate responses from both Brazilian and American officials. Wajngarten was part of Bolsonaro's entourage that traveled to the U.S. for diplomatic meetings, including an event at Trump's private club over the weekend.

The potential implications of this news are significant, as Wajngarten was in close proximity to both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence during the visit. Photographs and videos from the event show Wajngarten standing near the U.S. president, raising questions about possible exposure. Despite this, the White House has stated that President Trump does not currently plan to undergo testing for the virus, citing that he is not exhibiting any symptoms.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham addressed concerns, stating, ""Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time."" She further emphasized that the White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service are working closely to ensure the safety of all involved.

The Brazilian government has also taken swift actions in response to the situation. President Bolsonaro, who was also present at the Mar-a-Lago meetings, is reportedly being monitored for any signs of illness. Brazil's health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, has confirmed that Bolsonaro is being tested for the virus as a precautionary measure, though he noted that the president is currently asymptomatic.

This incident comes at a time when both nations are grappling with the global spread of the coronavirus. In Brazil, confirmed cases have been steadily rising, prompting the government to implement stricter measures to contain the virus. Similarly, the United States is facing its own challenges, with various states declaring emergencies and taking steps to mitigate the outbreak.

The news of Wajngarten's diagnosis has added urgency to discussions about international travel and the risks associated with high-level diplomatic interactions during a pandemic. Analysts warn that such incidents underscore the importance of rigorous health protocols and highlight the vulnerability of global leaders to the virus.

In the wake of this development, public health experts are urging caution and recommending that anyone who may have come into contact with Wajngarten be vigilant for symptoms and consider testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to update its guidelines and recommendations for those who may have been exposed to COVID-19.

As the situation evolves, both the Brazilian and U.S. governments are likely to face increased scrutiny over their handling of health protocols and the potential implications for diplomatic relations. For now, both nations are focusing on ensuring the safety of their leaders and addressing the broader challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the global nature of the crisis and the interconnectedness of nations in times of health emergencies. As efforts to contain the virus continue, the world watches closely, hoping for swift action and effective measures to prevent further spread.",gpt

The other gun lobby,"In the bustling corridors of Washington, D.C., where political influence is both wielded and wooed, the gun debate has often been dominated by powerful voices advocating for gun rights. Yet, amid the echoes of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and similar organizations, another force is quietly but steadily making its presence felt: a coalition of gun safety advocates that some have begun to refer to as ""the other gun lobby.""

This emerging faction is not a single entity but a diverse network of groups and individuals united by a common goal of promoting gun safety and reducing gun violence. Unlike the traditional gun lobby, which often emphasizes the Second Amendment and individual rights, this coalition focuses on public health, safety, and community well-being.

At the forefront of this movement is Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. With substantial financial backing, Everytown has become a formidable player, supporting candidates who advocate for sensible gun laws and pushing for reforms such as universal background checks and red flag laws. The organization has leveraged its resources to amplify its message across various media platforms, ensuring that the conversation around gun safety is heard alongside that of gun rights.

Joining Everytown are a host of other organizations, each bringing their unique perspectives and strengths to the table. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, named after James Brady, who was shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, continues to be a leading voice in the movement. The group advocates for policy changes that it believes will save lives, such as restrictions on assault weapons and increased research into gun violence.

Moms Demand Action, a grassroots initiative born out of the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, has grown into a nationwide network of mothers and allies advocating for change. Their approach is both personal and political, mobilizing communities to demand action from their elected officials. Their motto, “Gun Sense in America,” reflects their commitment to practical, achievable solutions that prioritize safety without infringing on rights.

These organizations and others like them are increasingly shaping the legislative landscape. In recent years, they have scored significant victories at state levels. From passing universal background checks in Nevada to enacting Extreme Risk Protection Orders in states like Florida and Vermont, their impact is being felt across the country. These wins, often in unexpected places, highlight a shifting tide in public opinion regarding gun safety and regulation.

However, the road is fraught with challenges. The gun safety lobby faces stiff opposition from well-established and well-funded gun rights organizations. The NRA, despite recent financial and legal troubles, remains a potent force with a loyal membership and significant political clout. Moreover, cultural and regional differences add layers of complexity to the debate, with many Americans viewing gun ownership as an integral part of their heritage and identity.

The other gun lobby is well aware of these challenges. Their strategy, therefore, involves not just advocating for policy change but also engaging in dialogue with gun owners to find common ground. Many in this movement emphasize that they are not anti-gun but pro-safety, seeking to balance individual rights with collective security.

As the political landscape evolves, so too does the narrative around guns in America. Recent polls suggest a growing consensus in favor of measures like background checks and restrictions on high-capacity magazines. This shift in public opinion provides momentum for the other gun lobby, suggesting that its message is resonating with a broader audience.

In the coming years, the influence of this emerging coalition will likely continue to grow. As they build alliances, both within and outside traditional political frameworks, they are reshaping the conversation around guns in America. Their approach, marked by pragmatism and inclusivity, is a testament to the changing dynamics of advocacy in the modern era.

With an eye towards the future, the other gun lobby is poised to play a critical role in shaping policies that aim to reduce gun violence and enhance public safety. Their journey underscores the power of grassroots activism and strategic advocacy in effecting meaningful change in a deeply polarized landscape.",gpt

"'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert","In the bustling streets of Macao, where East meets West in a harmonious blend of cultures, there lies a beloved culinary gem that has stood the test of time: the Macanese egg tart. Known for its crisp, buttery pastry shell encasing a creamy, caramelized custard filling, this dessert has become synonymous with the region’s rich gastronomic history. But what is the secret behind Macao's most famous dessert, and why has it remained unchanged over the years?

To uncover the mystery behind this iconic treat, we ventured into the heart of Macao’s culinary scene, where the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked tarts wafts through the narrow alleyways. Our journey led us to Lord Stow’s Bakery, an institution credited with popularizing the modern Macanese egg tart. Founded in 1989 by Englishman Andrew Stow, the bakery has become a pilgrimage site for dessert aficionados from around the world.

Andrew Stow, often referred to as the ""Lord of the Tart,"" passed away in 2006, but his legacy endures through the unwavering dedication of his family and staff. We spoke with his daughter, Emma Stow, who now helms the bakery alongside her mother, Margaret Wong. ""Dad always believed in the power of simplicity,"" Emma remarks, her eyes reflecting a deep reverence for her father's craft. ""He used to say, 'Like the tart, I never change.' It was his mantra.""

The secret behind the tarts, Emma explains, lies in the meticulous attention to detail and the unwavering commitment to quality ingredients. ""We still use the same recipe my father developed when he first opened the bakery,"" she says. ""It's all about balance—the perfect ratio of sugar to egg, the creaminess of the custard, and the crispness of the pastry.""

Unlike the Portuguese pastel de nata, which inspired the Macanese version, Lord Stow’s egg tarts are distinguished by their unique combination of textures and flavors. The pastry is hand-rolled and folded multiple times to achieve its signature flaky layers. The custard, a harmonious blend of eggs, sugar, cream, and a hint of vanilla, is baked to perfection until it develops a glossy, caramelized top.

Emma emphasizes that while the recipe may be simple, the execution is anything but. ""Every tart is a labor of love,"" she says. ""Our bakers are trained to understand the nuances of temperature and timing. It's an art passed down from one generation to the next.""

This commitment to tradition has not gone unnoticed. Over the years, Lord Stow’s Bakery has garnered a loyal following, with customers lining up daily to savor their share of sweet indulgence. Among them is local resident Chen Mei, who has been a regular visitor for over two decades. ""I grew up with these tarts,"" she shares, cradling a freshly baked pastry in her hands. ""They remind me of my childhood. In a world that's always changing, it's comforting to have something that stays the same.""

While the bakery remains rooted in its traditions, it has also embraced the modern world’s demands. The Stow family has expanded operations, opening branches in Japan, Taiwan, and other parts of Asia. Yet, despite the growth, the essence of the Macanese egg tart remains unchanged. ""We want to share our culture with the world,"" Emma explains, ""but we’ll never compromise on what makes our tarts special.""

For those who cannot make the journey to Macao, Lord Stow’s Bakery has made strides in bringing the experience to a broader audience. Through collaborations with international food chains and packaged products, the humble egg tart has found its way into homes far beyond its origins. Still, as Emma points out, ""Nothing beats enjoying a freshly baked tart right here in Macao.""

As we conclude our visit, the warm, inviting glow of the bakery leaves a lasting impression. It's clear that the secret behind Macao's most famous dessert is not solely in its ingredients or technique but in the unwavering passion of those who continue to craft it. In a city known for its dynamic fusion of old and new, the Macanese egg tart stands as a testament to the enduring power of tradition. Like the tart itself, some things are simply too perfect to change.",gpt
One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government,"In a significant move to stabilize the nation's financial sector, the Indian government has stepped in to rescue one of the country’s largest banks, State Bank of Bharat (SBB), amid mounting concerns over its solvency. This intervention underscores the challenges facing India's banking system, which has been grappling with burgeoning bad loans and a slowing economy.

State Bank of Bharat, widely known as SBB, has been a cornerstone of India's banking sector, serving millions of customers across the nation with a wide array of financial products and services. However, in recent months, the bank has struggled under the weight of non-performing assets (NPAs), deteriorating credit quality, and a sharp decline in investor confidence. The government’s decision to intervene comes after SBB's attempts to raise capital through market channels failed to materialize, leaving it vulnerable to insolvency.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, addressing a packed press conference in New Delhi, assured the public that the bank's depositors and stakeholders would be protected. ""The government has taken decisive action to ensure the stability of our financial system. We are committed to safeguarding the interests of depositors and maintaining the trust that the public has in our banking institutions,"" she stated.

The rescue package includes a capital infusion of approximately ₹20,000 crore (about $2.7 billion), which will be aimed at shoring up the bank's capital base and restoring confidence among its clientele. This lifeline is expected to enable SBB to address its immediate liquidity needs and strengthen its balance sheet. The government has also appointed a new management team to oversee the restructuring process and implement measures to improve operational efficiencies.

Analysts have pointed out that the challenges faced by SBB are reflective of broader systemic issues within the Indian banking sector. Over the past few years, the industry has been plagued by a rise in NPAs, largely attributed to loans extended during the country's rapid economic expansion in the previous decade. As growth slowed, many firms failed to service their debts, leaving banks with a significant burden of bad loans.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s central bank, has been closely monitoring the situation and is expected to play a crucial role in the reconstruction plan. In a statement, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized that the central bank would provide all necessary support to ensure the stability of the banking system. ""We are working in close coordination with the government to ensure that the interests of depositors are protected and that the banking system remains robust,"" Das said.

The impact of SBB's troubles has been felt across the financial markets. Shares of State Bank of Bharat plummeted by 30% over the past month, as jittery investors reacted to news of its financial woes. However, following the government's announcement, there was a modest recovery in its stock price, signaling a tentative return of confidence.

Critics of the rescue package have raised concerns about the precedent it sets for future government interventions in the banking sector. Some argue that taxpayer money should not be used to bail out financial institutions, suggesting instead that stringent regulatory measures and better risk assessment protocols are needed to prevent similar crises in the future.

Despite these criticisms, many industry experts have welcomed the government’s intervention as a necessary step to prevent a potential banking crisis. ""The government’s swift action has averted what could have been a catastrophic collapse, with far-reaching consequences for the economy,"" said Raghuram Sharma, a banking sector analyst at Mumbai-based Pratham Finance.

Looking ahead, the focus will likely be on the implementation of reforms aimed at strengthening the resilience of India's banking system. This includes improving governance standards, enhancing risk management practices, and ensuring greater transparency in financial reporting.

For now, the rescue of State Bank of Bharat serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing India's banking sector. As the country seeks to navigate its way through economic headwinds, the stability of its financial institutions remains a critical component of its growth trajectory. The government’s intervention may have provided a temporary reprieve, but the path to a more sustainable and resilient banking system will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders involved.",gpt
This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power,"In an era where the global community is increasingly focusing on sustainable and renewable energy sources, a small island chain is emerging as an unexpected leader in the transition to hydrogen power. The archipelago, nestled in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean, is setting a precedent for how isolated communities can harness the power of hydrogen to meet their energy needs while mitigating environmental impact.

The island chain, known as the Vavau Archipelago, has long been dependent on imported fossil fuels to power its modest infrastructure. However, the rising cost of these imports, coupled with the islands' susceptibility to climate change effects, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events, has driven local leaders and innovators to search for alternative energy solutions. Their answer: hydrogen power.

The transition began several years ago when the Vavau government partnered with international renewable energy experts and technology firms to explore the feasibility of hydrogen as a primary energy source. The archipelago's geographical advantages, such as abundant sunlight and wind, provide optimal conditions for producing green hydrogen, which is created by using renewable energy to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

With funding from international environmental organizations and significant investments from private sector entities, the Vavau Archipelago has constructed a state-of-the-art hydrogen production facility. This facility, powered by an array of solar panels and wind turbines, produces hydrogen that is then used to generate electricity for the islands' homes, businesses, and transportation systems.

The impact has been transformative. Not only has the island chain significantly reduced its carbon footprint, but it has also become self-sufficient in terms of energy production. Local officials report that the transition to hydrogen power has reduced energy costs by nearly 30%, a substantial saving that is being reinvested into the community to improve infrastructure and public services.

Moreover, the switch to hydrogen power has spurred economic growth by creating new jobs in the renewable energy sector. Training programs have been established to equip residents with the skills needed to work in this burgeoning industry, thereby reducing unemployment rates and enhancing the local economy.

The success of the Vavau Archipelago's hydrogen initiative has not gone unnoticed. It has drawn interest from other island nations and remote communities worldwide, many of which face similar challenges related to energy dependency and environmental vulnerability. Delegations from Caribbean and Southeast Asian countries have visited Vavau to study its model, hoping to replicate its success in their regions.

However, the journey has not been without its challenges. The initial investment required for the transition to hydrogen power was substantial, and securing funding was a significant hurdle. Additionally, the technology involved in hydrogen production and storage is complex, requiring a skilled workforce and ongoing research and development to optimize efficiency and safety.

Despite these challenges, the leadership of the Vavau Archipelago remains optimistic about the future of hydrogen power. They are committed to continuing their pioneering efforts, with plans to expand the hydrogen production facility and explore additional applications for hydrogen in sectors such as shipping and aviation.

The archipelago's government is also focused on fostering international collaborations to advance hydrogen technology further and promote global energy sustainability. They are actively participating in international forums and contributing to the global dialogue on renewable energy transitions.

As the world grapples with the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, the Vavau Archipelago stands as a beacon of innovation and hope. Its successful implementation of hydrogen power serves as a powerful example of how small communities can lead the way in sustainable energy practices, offering valuable lessons for the global effort to combat climate change and achieve energy independence.

In this remote corner of the Pacific, hydrogen is not just a new energy source—it's a catalyst for change, driving economic development, fostering international cooperation, and paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future.",gpt
"India identifies 29 coronavirus cases as global infections top 95,000","India has reported 29 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, marking a significant development as health officials intensify efforts to contain the outbreak. This comes amid escalating global concerns, with total confirmed infections worldwide surpassing 95,000, as countries grapple with containment challenges and the race to develop a vaccine continues.

The Indian government announced the new figures following an uptick in cases, including a recent cluster linked to travelers from Italy. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan stated that the cases are being monitored closely, and the government is taking stringent measures to prevent further spread. ""Our focus is on tracing contacts and ensuring that all potential carriers are quarantined and tested,"" Vardhan said at a press briefing held in New Delhi.

As part of its containment strategy, India has ramped up screening efforts at airports and seaports, particularly for passengers arriving from affected countries. The government has also advised Indian citizens to avoid non-essential travel to countries with high infection rates. Additionally, several educational institutions across the country have been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure.

The situation in India is evolving rapidly, with authorities emphasizing the importance of public awareness and hygiene practices to curb transmission. Local health departments are collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO) to disseminate accurate information and debunk myths surrounding the virus. Dr. Balram Bhargava, Director-General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), urged people to remain calm and follow recommended health guidelines. ""Panic is unnecessary; what is required is vigilance and adherence to public health advisories,"" Bhargava stated.

Globally, the coronavirus outbreak has now been reported in over 80 countries. The rapid spread has prompted the WHO to increase its risk assessment of the virus to ""very high,"" urging nations to prepare for potential pandemics. China remains the epicenter of the outbreak, with the majority of cases and fatalities. However, significant outbreaks in South Korea, Iran, and Italy have raised alarms across the globe.

In Europe, Italy has become the hardest-hit country, with over 3,000 confirmed cases and a rising death toll. Italian authorities have implemented widespread lockdowns in affected areas, canceled public events, and closed schools to stem the spread. Meanwhile, South Korea has mobilized extensive testing and quarantine measures, reporting over 5,600 cases predominantly linked to a religious sect in the city of Daegu.

The United States has also seen a rise in cases, with President Donald Trump announcing measures to enhance screening and testing capabilities. Local governments in several states have declared emergencies, allowing them to redirect resources and streamline response efforts.

Economically, the coronavirus outbreak has triggered significant disruptions, shaking global markets and supply chains. Businesses, particularly those reliant on Chinese manufacturing, are experiencing delays and shortages. The International Monetary Fund has warned of potential global economic slowdowns, urging coordinated international fiscal and monetary responses.

The scientific community is racing against time to develop a vaccine, with several pharmaceutical companies and research institutions announcing progress in candidate trials. However, experts caution that a viable vaccine may still be months away from public availability, underscoring the need for immediate public health interventions.

In India, the government has allocated additional resources to strengthen healthcare infrastructure and ensure the availability of medical supplies. Hospitals designated to treat coronavirus patients are being equipped with isolation wards, and medical staff are receiving specialized training to handle cases effectively. The government has also imposed restrictions on the export of certain medical supplies to prioritize domestic needs.

As the situation unfolds, the Indian populace remains on high alert, with social media abuzz with updates and reactions. The government's ability to manage the crisis effectively will be crucial in determining the trajectory of the outbreak within the country. For now, health experts and officials continue to urge the public to remain informed, stay calm, and follow recommended health practices to navigate this challenging period.",gpt
Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets,"In the bustling city of Mumbai, where every inch of space is a testament to life's relentless pace, one man has taken on the somber task of remembering those whom society has left behind. Known locally as the ""Saviour of the Dead,"" Ashok Gupta has dedicated his life to providing dignified burials for the unclaimed bodies that otherwise risk fading into oblivion.

For over two decades, Gupta has been a silent sentinel for the deceased who have no one else. His journey began in the late 1990s when he witnessed the harrowing sight of an unclaimed body left unattended at a local hospital morgue. Disturbed by the apathy surrounding the situation, Gupta knew he had to act. Since that day, he has made it his mission to ensure that every unclaimed body he encounters is given a proper burial, regardless of the person’s religion, background, or social status.

Operating mostly on donations and his savings, Gupta has managed to provide a dignified farewell to over 2,000 souls. ""Every human being deserves respect in death as much as in life,"" says Gupta, his voice steady with conviction. His operation is run from a small office in the heart of Mumbai, where stacks of paperwork detail his efforts and the lives he has touched.

The process begins with a call from local hospitals and morgues, informing him of unclaimed bodies. Once notified, Gupta undertakes the meticulous task of identifying the deceased, attempting to trace any relatives who might be looking for them. In many cases, these efforts prove fruitless, highlighting a growing issue in urban India where the marginalized often fall through the cracks of a rapidly moving society.

India's cities are home to millions of migrants, many of whom leave behind families in search of better opportunities. The anonymity of urban life, combined with the pressures of economic survival, means that some of these individuals die alone, their identities swallowed by the very city they sought refuge in. When there are no relatives to claim the body, it becomes a statistic, a task for overburdened civic bodies to handle with little ceremony.

Gupta's work goes beyond mere burial. He often covers the costs of transporting the bodies to cremation grounds or burial sites, arranges for the necessary rituals to be performed, and sometimes even stands in as the sole mourner. ""I see this as a service to humanity,"" he explains. ""To be forgotten in life is tragic, but to be forgotten in death is an injustice I cannot accept.""

His efforts have not gone unnoticed. Over the years, Gupta has garnered recognition from various social organizations and has been the subject of documentaries and news features. Yet, he remains humble, often deflecting praise back to the volunteers and donors who support his cause.

Despite his dedication, Gupta faces numerous challenges. Bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of funding are constant obstacles. The legal formalities involved in claiming unclaimed bodies can be daunting, often requiring persistence and patience. Furthermore, the societal stigma attached to dealing with the dead deters many from volunteering for such a cause.

In recent years, however, a growing awareness of his work has attracted a new generation of volunteers, eager to support his cause. These young individuals bring with them fresh ideas and energy, helping to expand Gupta's reach and streamline operations. Together, they are working on initiatives to raise awareness about the plight of unclaimed bodies and the importance of giving them a dignified farewell.

As Mumbai continues to grow, so does the number of unclaimed bodies. Gupta's work is a stark reminder of the disparities that exist in India's urban centers, where the gap between the haves and have-nots is ever-widening. Yet, his relentless dedication offers a glimmer of hope, a testament to the power of compassion in the face of indifference.

In the twilight of his career, Gupta dreams of the day when his services will no longer be needed, when society will ensure that everyone is remembered, even in death. Until then, he remains the guardian of the forgotten, the saviour of the dead, tirelessly working to ensure that those India forgets are granted a final moment of dignity.",gpt

Four women were serious candidates for president. What happened?,"In a historic turn of events, the latest presidential race saw four women emerge as serious contenders for the highest office in the land. Each brought a unique set of skills, experiences, and visions for the future, captivating a nation long accustomed to male-dominant political leadership. However, as the dust settles, none of these trailblazing women secured the nomination. So, what happened?

The primary season was electrifying, with the diverse candidacies of Senator Emily Tran, Governor Maria Gonzalez, Representative Aisha Kapoor, and business leader Julia Ramirez. Each woman inspired millions with their platforms, which emphasized everything from healthcare reform and economic equality to climate change and foreign policy rejuvenation.

Senator Emily Tran, a progressive firebrand known for her eloquent speeches and grassroots support, built a campaign on healthcare reform and student debt relief. Her rallies drew massive crowds, particularly among younger voters. However, Tran faced challenges in broadening her appeal beyond her base. Critics argued that her proposals were too radical for Middle America, and she struggled to gain traction among older demographics and more conservative areas. Despite a strong start, her campaign faltered in key early primaries where she needed to demonstrate cross-regional support.

Governor Maria Gonzalez, on the other hand, positioned herself as a moderate capable of bridging the political divide. Her tenure as governor was marked by bipartisan achievements, including successful education reform and infrastructure projects. Gonzalez's campaign emphasized unity and pragmatism. However, her reluctance to embrace more progressive policies alienated a significant portion of the Democratic base. This hesitation was compounded by attacks from rivals labeling her as too centrist in an increasingly polarized political landscape. Her inability to ignite the passion necessary for a broad coalition ultimately led to her withdrawal from the race.

Representative Aisha Kapoor, a charismatic legislator with a focus on social justice and environmental issues, captivated audiences with her compelling personal story and commitment to underrepresented communities. Kapoor's campaign found resonance particularly among minority groups and the urban electorate. However, her challengers successfully framed her as lacking sufficient experience on the national stage. Additionally, internal campaign missteps and funding shortages curtailed her ability to sustain momentum in the crowded field.

Julia Ramirez, a successful entrepreneur, entered the race as an outsider promising to disrupt the status quo. Her business acumen and straightforward approach appealed to voters tired of conventional political rhetoric. Ramirez's campaign focused on economic innovation and job creation, resonating with working-class voters. Nevertheless, her lack of political experience and occasional controversial statements raised concerns about her readiness for the presidency. Despite her initial appeal, these factors led to dwindling support as the primaries progressed.

The failure of these candidates to secure the nomination highlights several broader challenges facing women in politics. Despite significant progress, gender bias remains a pervasive issue. Women candidates often face more scrutiny than their male counterparts regarding their electability, leadership style, and even appearance. Furthermore, societal expectations and entrenched stereotypes can hinder their ability to project authority and competence.

The intense media spotlight can exacerbate these challenges, with female candidates' actions and statements dissected more vigorously than those of their male peers. This double standard was evident in the coverage of this race, where moments of vulnerability or perceived missteps were magnified, often overshadowing policy discussions.

Financial disparities also played a role. Women candidates historically receive less campaign funding than men, limiting their ability to compete in a system heavily reliant on media buys and extensive ground operations. This financial gap was evident in the campaigns of Tran, Kapoor, and Ramirez, who all reported fundraising struggles compared to their male counterparts.

Despite these setbacks, the candidacies of Tran, Gonzalez, Kapoor, and Ramirez have left an indelible mark on the political landscape. Their presence in the race has inspired a new generation of women to pursue political office and advocate for change. Moreover, their platforms have influenced the broader political discourse, pushing issues like healthcare, economic equality, and social justice to the forefront.

As the nation reflects on this unprecedented primary season, the hope remains that the momentum generated by these candidates will pave the way for more women to ascend to leadership roles. The road to the presidency may have been thwarted this time, but the journey toward gender parity in politics continues, fueled by the legacies of these formidable women.",gpt
This South African pilot is on a mission to change the face of aviation in Africa,"Captain Zanele Mbeki, a trailblazing South African pilot, is soaring to new heights as she undertakes a mission to revolutionize the aviation industry across the African continent. With her indomitable spirit and unwavering commitment, Mbeki is not only breaking barriers in a traditionally male-dominated field but is also paving the way for future generations of African aviators.

Born and raised in Johannesburg, Mbeki's fascination with flying began at a young age. Inspired by watching planes take off and land at OR Tambo International Airport, she nurtured a dream to become a pilot. Despite facing numerous challenges, including financial constraints and gender biases, she persevered, earning her pilot's license in 2008. Today, with over 7,000 flight hours under her belt, Captain Mbeki is one of South Africa's most respected and accomplished pilots.

Mbeki's mission to transform African aviation is driven by both personal passion and a profound sense of responsibility. ""Aviation in Africa has immense potential, yet it remains largely untapped,"" she explains. ""I want to change that by making aviation more accessible and inclusive, particularly for women and underrepresented communities.""

To achieve this ambitious goal, Mbeki has launched several initiatives aimed at fostering a new generation of African pilots and aviation professionals. One of her most notable projects is the establishment of the African Aviators Academy (AAA), a pioneering training institution based in Johannesburg. The academy offers comprehensive training programs for aspiring pilots, engineers, and air traffic controllers, with a special emphasis on supporting women and disadvantaged youth.

The AAA's innovative curriculum not only covers the technical aspects of flying but also integrates crucial leadership and problem-solving skills. ""We want our graduates to be well-rounded professionals who can navigate the complex challenges of modern aviation,"" Mbeki says. ""It's about equipping them with the tools they need to excel in a competitive industry.""

Mbeki's efforts have already begun to bear fruit. Since its inception in 2015, the African Aviators Academy has trained over 300 students, with a notable 40% of them being women. Many of these graduates have gone on to secure positions with major airlines and aviation companies across Africa, a testament to the academy's growing reputation for excellence.

Beyond her work with the AAA, Mbeki is also a vocal advocate for policy changes that support the growth of the aviation sector in Africa. She frequently collaborates with government agencies, industry stakeholders, and international organizations to address issues such as inadequate infrastructure, high operational costs, and limited access to funding.

In recognition of her tireless efforts, Captain Mbeki has received numerous accolades, including the prestigious International Aviation Women's Association (IAWA) Leadership Award. Her achievements have made her a role model for countless young Africans, inspiring them to pursue careers in aviation and other STEM fields.

Despite her success, Mbeki remains focused on the future. She envisions a continent where African airlines can compete on the global stage, where young African talent is nurtured and celebrated, and where aviation serves as a catalyst for economic growth and development.

""There is still much work to be done,"" she acknowledges. ""But I am confident that with the right support and collaboration, we can transform African aviation into a powerhouse that drives progress and innovation across the continent.""

As Captain Zanele Mbeki continues her mission to change the face of aviation in Africa, her story serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that one determined individual can have. Through her dedication and vision, she is not only breaking barriers but also building bridges to a brighter, more inclusive future for African aviation.",gpt
Do I need a flu shot?,"As the autumn leaves begin to fall and temperatures drop, the annual debate over flu vaccinations surfaces once again. With the onset of flu season, many people find themselves pondering the question: Do I need a flu shot? Experts and health organizations strongly advocate for the influenza vaccine, highlighting its importance in safeguarding individual and public health.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), everyone aged six months and older should receive a flu vaccine each year, barring rare exceptions. This broad recommendation is rooted in the potential severity of the flu and the vaccine’s role in preventing widespread illness. The flu can lead to serious health complications, especially for vulnerable populations such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions.

Dr. Emily Carter, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, underscores the importance of the flu vaccine as a preventive tool. ""The flu vaccine not only protects the individual who receives it but also contributes to community immunity,"" she explains. ""By reducing the number of potential hosts for the virus, we decrease the overall spread within the community.""

The flu virus is notorious for its ability to mutate rapidly, which is why annual vaccination is crucial. Each year, scientists develop the vaccine based on predictions about which flu strains will be most prevalent. Although the vaccine’s effectiveness can vary, it remains a critical defense against severe flu-related outcomes. The CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented approximately 105,000 hospitalizations during the 2019-2020 flu season alone.

Despite these encouraging statistics, flu vaccination rates remain suboptimal. Common misconceptions about the flu shot, such as the belief that it can cause the flu, contribute to hesitancy. Dr. Carter dispels this myth: ""The flu vaccine contains inactivated virus or a recombinant component, which means it cannot cause the flu. Mild side effects, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, are normal and typically short-lived.""

Another factor contributing to hesitancy is doubt about the vaccine's effectiveness. While it's true that flu vaccine efficacy can fluctuate due to the virus's rapid evolution, experts agree that some protection is better than none. ""Even if the vaccine is not a perfect match for circulating strains, it can still reduce the severity of illness and the risk of complications,"" Dr. Carter asserts.

For those concerned about the cost of vaccination, many health insurance plans cover the flu shot at no additional charge. Additionally, local health departments and clinics often provide free or low-cost vaccinations, ensuring that financial barriers do not impede access.

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health officials emphasize the importance of flu vaccination to reduce the burden on healthcare systems. Simultaneous outbreaks of flu and COVID-19 could overwhelm hospitals and healthcare providers. ""Getting a flu shot is a simple yet effective way to help healthcare workers by minimizing flu-related hospital visits,"" says Dr. Carter.

For individuals still unsure about getting vaccinated, Dr. Carter recommends consulting with a healthcare provider. ""Your doctor can provide guidance based on your medical history and current health status,"" she suggests. ""It's always better to have a conversation with a professional who understands your unique situation.""

Ultimately, the decision to get a flu shot is a personal one, influenced by individual circumstances and beliefs. However, the consensus among health experts is clear: the flu vaccine is a safe and effective means of protecting oneself and others from a potentially serious illness. As flu season approaches, now is the time to consider rolling up your sleeve and taking a proactive step toward health and wellness.",gpt
"Coronavirus outbreak worsens in Italy and Japan, as situation stabilizes in China","The coronavirus pandemic, which has gripped the world for over a year, continues to evolve as Italy and Japan grapple with worsening outbreaks, even as China sees signs of stabilization.

In Italy, the situation has become increasingly dire, with the country reporting a surge in daily new cases and hospitalizations. Health officials have attributed the spike to the emergence of more transmissible variants and a lag in vaccination uptake among certain population groups. The Italian government has responded by reinstating some restrictions, including mandatory mask-wearing in crowded outdoor spaces and limitations on large gatherings. Schools in several regions have returned to remote learning as authorities strive to control the spread of the virus.

""We are deeply concerned about the current trajectory of the virus in our country,"" said Roberto Speranza, Italy's Minister of Health. ""It is imperative that we take swift and decisive action to protect our citizens and healthcare system.""

Hospitals in hard-hit regions, such as Lombardy and Lazio, are experiencing increased pressure, with intensive care units nearing capacity. Medical professionals are working around the clock to manage the influx of patients, and some hospitals have postponed elective surgeries to focus on COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, in Japan, the situation has also taken a turn for the worse, with infections rising steadily across the nation. The government has extended its state of emergency in several prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka, in an effort to curb the spread. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has urged citizens to remain vigilant and adhere to public health guidelines, emphasizing the importance of vaccination in overcoming the latest wave.

Japan's vaccination campaign has faced challenges, including supply chain issues and vaccine hesitancy among some segments of the population. However, efforts are being ramped up to ensure more widespread coverage, with the government setting ambitious targets for the coming months.

""We must remain united and committed in our fight against COVID-19,"" Kishida stated in a recent press briefing. ""Our actions today will determine the course of the pandemic tomorrow.""

In contrast, China, where the coronavirus was first detected, is experiencing a period of relative stability. The country has reported a decline in new cases, a testament to its stringent public health measures and rapid vaccination rollout. China has implemented a zero-tolerance policy towards outbreaks, employing mass testing, contact tracing, and targeted lockdowns to swiftly contain any potential spread.

The Chinese government continues to enforce strict entry requirements for international travelers, including mandatory quarantine upon arrival. This approach, combined with a high vaccination rate, has contributed to the country's success in managing the virus.

However, Chinese health officials warn against complacency, noting the potential threat posed by new variants. ""We must remain vigilant and prepared to respond to any changes in the situation,"" said Zhang Wenhong, a leading infectious disease expert in China.

As the world watches these developments, the disparities in the pandemic's impact highlight the ongoing challenges faced by nations in navigating this global health crisis. The differing trajectories underscore the importance of a coordinated international response, including equitable vaccine distribution and the sharing of best practices.

Global health authorities, including the World Health Organization, continue to advocate for increased cooperation and solidarity among nations. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's Director-General, emphasized the critical role of vaccines in ending the pandemic, urging countries to prioritize vaccination campaigns and address barriers to access.

""The pandemic is far from over, and we must continue to work together to protect lives and livelihoods,"" Tedros said. ""It is a shared responsibility that requires collective action.""

As Italy and Japan confront their worsening outbreaks, and China maintains its cautious approach, the world is reminded of the virus's unpredictable nature and the ongoing need for vigilance. The path to recovery remains uncertain, but with concerted efforts and global solidarity, there is hope for a future beyond the pandemic.",gpt
BMW redesigns its iconic logo,"In a bold move that has taken the automotive world by surprise, BMW has unveiled a redesign of its iconic logo, marking a significant shift in the German automaker's brand identity. This is the first major change in over two decades for the BMW badge, a symbol synonymous with luxury, engineering excellence, and cutting-edge innovation.

The new logo, which BMW revealed at a live-streamed event from its Munich headquarters, maintains the circular shape and iconic blue-and-white color scheme that has become a hallmark of the brand. However, the design has been modernized to reflect a new era for the company, one that focuses on sustainability, digitalization, and a cleaner, more minimalist aesthetic.

BMW's latest emblem features a transparent ring replacing the traditional black outer circle, offering a more open and approachable look. This change is a significant departure from the previous design, which had been in use since 1997. The transparency symbolizes the company’s commitment to adaptability and innovation in an ever-evolving automotive landscape.

Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President of Customer & Brand BMW, explained the rationale behind the redesign: “The new logo and brand design symbolize the significance and relevance of the brand for mobility and the joy of driving in the future. It stands for openness and clarity, two attributes that are vital in today’s digital age.”

The decision to redesign the logo comes at a crucial time for BMW, as the company navigates an industry undergoing rapid transformation. With the global shift towards electric vehicles, autonomous driving technology, and a growing emphasis on eco-friendliness, BMW is positioning itself to remain a leader in the automotive sector.

The updated logo will be rolled out across BMW’s digital platforms immediately, with physical applications, such as on vehicles and dealerships, transitioning gradually over the next few years. The company has acknowledged that while the new design might take time to be fully embraced by its loyal customer base, it is confident that the logo will resonate with a new generation of consumers.

Reactions to the redesign have been mixed. While some industry experts praise BMW for its forward-thinking approach, others have expressed nostalgia for the more traditional look. “It’s always a risk to change something so iconic,” said automotive analyst Stefan Bratzel. “But BMW seems to be striking a balance between honoring its heritage and embracing the future.”

For years, BMW’s logo has been a topic of discussion among design enthusiasts and brand historians. The original emblem, created in 1917, was said to represent a spinning propeller against a blue sky, a nod to the company's origins as an aircraft engine manufacturer. Over time, the logo evolved, with subtle tweaks reflecting changes in design trends and technological advancements.

The latest redesign is not just about aesthetics; it is part of a broader strategy by BMW to redefine its brand narrative. As the company invests heavily in electric mobility and digital services, the new logo is intended to serve as a visual representation of its commitment to innovation and sustainability.

In addition to the logo, BMW has announced plans to introduce a range of new electric vehicles over the next few years, as part of its ambitious goal to have 25 electrified models by 2025. This move is seen as a direct response to increasing competition from rivals like Tesla and the growing demand for environmentally friendly transportation options.

As BMW embarks on this new chapter, the redesigned logo serves as a symbol of its evolution. By embracing change while honoring its legacy, BMW aims to solidify its position as a leader in the automotive industry and remain a relevant and influential brand in the years to come.

In the coming months, BMW enthusiasts and industry watchers alike will be keeping a close eye on how the new branding is received and how it impacts the company’s market presence. Whether this bold move will pay off remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: BMW is not afraid to innovate and redefine what it means to be a premium automotive brand in the 21st century.",gpt
China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic,"In a move that has reignited global tensions surrounding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese officials have recently propagated a narrative that the United States Army could be responsible for the outbreak. This claim, though lacking substantive evidence, has captured headlines and fueled an already intense geopolitical rivalry between the two nations.

The controversial assertion first emerged on Chinese social media platforms and state-run media, where officials suggested that American military personnel, who participated in the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019, may have introduced the virus to China. Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, took to Twitter to question whether the U.S. Army brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, urging further investigation into the origins of the virus in the United States.

The United States government has categorically denied these claims, labeling them as disinformation and part of a broader strategy by Beijing to deflect blame for the pandemic, which has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. U.S. State Department officials have condemned the narrative as a dangerous and unfounded attempt to rewrite the history of the pandemic.

""This is a classic move from the playbook of disinformation,"" said a senior U.S. State Department official. ""These kinds of claims divert attention from the real issue at hand—China's initial handling of the outbreak and the lack of transparency that followed.""

Public health experts and specialists in virology have also dismissed the Chinese allegations as lacking any credible scientific basis. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reiterated that the vast majority of scientific evidence points to a natural origin of the virus, likely linked to a wildlife source in China.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also stepped in to clarify that while investigations into the origins of COVID-19 should continue, there is no evidence to support the notion of the virus being deliberately introduced by any military force. The WHO has previously reported that the virus likely has a zoonotic origin, jumping from animals to humans in a market in Wuhan.

Despite these reassurances, the narrative has found traction among certain groups, both within China and among conspiracy theorists globally. Experts warn that such misinformation can have real-world consequences, exacerbating diplomatic tensions and hampering international cooperation needed to combat the ongoing pandemic.

""The spread of misinformation can be as dangerous as the virus itself,"" noted Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on COVID-19. ""It undermines the effort of scientists and public health officials who are working tirelessly to understand and combat the virus.""

This latest development is part of a broader pattern of mutual recrimination between the United States and China since the onset of the pandemic. Both countries have repeatedly accused each other of mishandling the crisis, with the U.S. criticizing China's initial response and lack of transparency, while China has pointed to the high infection and death rates in the United States as evidence of its own shortcomings.

The pandemic, which began in late 2019, has since evolved into a global crisis with far-reaching economic, social, and political consequences. As nations strive to control the spread of the virus, the need for collaboration and transparency has never been more critical. However, with superpowers like the United States and China engaging in a blame game, the path to global recovery may face significant obstacles.

For now, the international community remains focused on vaccine distribution, economic recovery, and preventing future pandemics. Yet, the persistence of such unfounded claims underscores the ongoing challenges in distinguishing fact from fiction in the digital age, where information can spread rapidly across borders without regard for its veracity.

As the world continues to grapple with the aftermath of COVID-19, the need for accurate information and multilateral cooperation is paramount. Whether the current tensions will subside or escalate remains uncertain, but the imperative for truth and transparency is clearer than ever.",gpt
"The Catholic nun who made joyous, politically charged Pop Art","In a world where art and religion often seem to exist in separate spheres, Sister Mary Corita Kent stands as a vibrant testament to the power of integrating faith with contemporary culture. Known for her colorful, politically charged Pop Art, Sister Corita was a Catholic nun who not only challenged artistic conventions but also used her work to comment on social justice issues, leaving a legacy that continues to inspire artists and activists alike.

Born Frances Elizabeth Kent in 1918 in Fort Dodge, Iowa, Corita Kent joined the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Los Angeles at the age of 18. Her path as an artist began in earnest when she studied at the Immaculate Heart College, where she later became an influential teacher and head of the art department. It was during the tumultuous 1960s that Sister Corita’s work flourished, reflecting the era’s spirit of change and resistance.

Sister Corita’s art is distinguished by its bold, bright colors and incorporation of text, often blending religious themes with popular culture. Her silkscreen prints—a medium she preferred for its accessibility and democratic nature—feature a mix of slogans, quotes, and imagery drawn from advertising and mass media. This innovative approach earned her a place in the Pop Art movement, alongside artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, even as her work carried a distinctly different message.

Unlike her Pop Art contemporaries, who often critiqued consumer culture with a sense of detachment or irony, Sister Corita imbued her pieces with a sense of hope and activism. Her art was an expression of her deep religious faith and her commitment to social causes, including civil rights, anti-war activism, and poverty alleviation. Through her work, she sought to convey messages of love, peace, and social justice, drawing inspiration from both scripture and contemporary figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy.

One of her most famous pieces, ""Love your brother,"" reflects this ethos. Created in 1969, the print juxtaposes the words of Jesus with a vibrant, eye-catching design. Sister Corita’s message was clear: love and compassion should be at the forefront of social change. Her art was not just to be admired but to spur viewers into action, encouraging them to look beyond the surface and consider the deeper implications of their beliefs and actions.

Sister Corita’s dual role as a nun and artist placed her at the center of a cultural and religious crossroads. Within the Catholic Church, she was a progressive force, pushing for reform and greater engagement with the modern world. Her innovative teaching methods and open-minded approach drew both admiration and controversy, especially as the Second Vatican Council encouraged dialogue between the Church and contemporary culture.

In 1968, Sister Corita made the difficult decision to leave her order, a move that allowed her greater freedom to pursue her art and activism. Despite this change, her work continued to reflect her spiritual roots and commitment to social justice. She spent the next two decades creating art, lecturing, and exhibiting her work until her death in 1986 from cancer.

Today, Sister Corita Kent’s legacy endures, with her art displayed in major museums and collections worldwide. Her message resonates in a society still grappling with many of the same issues she addressed, from inequality to political division. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in her work, as new generations discover the powerful blend of joy and activism that defines her art.

Sister Corita Kent remains a unique figure in the art world, a reminder of the potential for art to serve as a catalyst for change. Her life and work continue to inspire those who seek to use creativity as a means of making the world a more just and compassionate place. As her art invites us to see the world through a lens of hope and action, her story serves as a testament to the enduring power of faith, art, and the human spirit.",gpt
How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all,"In the world of English football, few challenges are as daunting as facing a high-flying Liverpool side, a team known for its relentless pressing, clinical finishing, and tactical prowess under the guidance of Jürgen Klopp. Yet, as Watford’s seasoned defender Christian Kabasele explains, there is a method to the madness when it comes to toppling the Merseyside giants.

As the Premier League season unfolds, Watford finds itself preparing for one of its most challenging fixtures, and Kabasele, with his wealth of experience, has been pivotal in strategizing how to counter Liverpool's formidable force. Speaking candidly about the upcoming clash, Kabasele shared insights into the Hornets' game plan, emphasizing adaptability, discipline, and exploiting vulnerabilities.

“The first thing you need to acknowledge is their intensity,” Kabasele stated during a recent interview. “Liverpool plays with such a high tempo that if you're not prepared to match their energy, you'll find yourself overwhelmed. It’s crucial to stay composed and not get sucked into their pace.”

Kabasele highlighted the importance of a solid defensive structure as the cornerstone of Watford’s strategy. “Against a team like Liverpool, your defensive line has to be airtight. Communication is key, and every player must know their role and stick to it. We’ve worked extensively on maintaining a compact shape, particularly to counter their counter-attacks.”

The Belgian defender also underscored the necessity of nullifying Liverpool’s attacking threats. “You have to be mindful of players like Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané—they can change the game in an instant. It's about cutting off their supply lines and ensuring they don't have the space to operate in the final third.”

While defense is critical, Kabasele acknowledged that merely containing Liverpool isn’t enough. To truly beat them, Watford must be proactive in their approach. “You can’t just sit back and defend for 90 minutes. When you win the ball, you have to be decisive. Quick transitions and exploiting spaces left by their full-backs, who often push high up the pitch, can create opportunities.”

One of Watford’s key tactics involves capitalizing on set-pieces, an area where Liverpool has occasionally shown vulnerability. “Set-pieces are a chance for us, especially with the aerial presence we have in the team. It’s something we’ve been focusing on in training, and it could be a crucial factor,” Kabasele noted.

The mental aspect of facing a top-tier team like Liverpool is another element Kabasele emphasized. “Belief is vital. You have to go into the game with the mindset that you can win. It’s easy to be intimidated by their reputation, but on the pitch, it’s eleven versus eleven. We have to back ourselves and trust in our abilities.”

Kabasele’s insights are a testament to the meticulous preparation that goes into facing one of the Premier League’s elite teams. While the odds may be stacked against them, Watford is determined to rise to the occasion, fueled by the prospect of an upset that would reverberate through the league.

As Watford gears up for this formidable test, the atmosphere in the dressing room is one of quiet confidence and steely determination. Kabasele, with his leadership and experience, is at the heart of this resolve, embodying the spirit of a team eager to defy expectations.

In the unpredictable world of football, anything can happen, and as Kabasele and Watford prepare to lock horns with Liverpool, fans and pundits alike will be watching closely to see if the Hornets can indeed find the winning formula.",gpt
"The Clanwilliam cedar survived the last ice age, but its future hangs in the balance","The rugged landscapes of South Africa's Cederberg Mountains are home to an ancient survivor: the Clanwilliam cedar. This venerable tree has withstood the test of time, enduring the harsh conditions of the last ice age and flourishing in a unique ecosystem. However, despite its resilience, the Clanwilliam cedar now faces an uncertain future, threatened by a confluence of modern challenges.

The Clanwilliam cedar (Widdringtonia wallichii) is an iconic species native to the Cederberg region, approximately 200 kilometers north of Cape Town. These trees, which can live for over a thousand years and grow up to 25 meters tall, have adapted to the area's rocky terrain and dry climate. Their survival through millennia of climate shifts is a testament to their robustness. Yet, today, factors such as climate change, human activity, and invasive species are posing unprecedented threats to their existence.

One of the most pressing issues is climate change, which is altering weather patterns and leading to more frequent and severe droughts in the region. Dr. Lisa Malan, a botanist specializing in South African flora, explains, ""The Cederberg region is experiencing warmer temperatures and reduced rainfall, creating conditions that are increasingly inhospitable for the Clanwilliam cedar. These trees rely on a delicate balance of environmental factors, and even slight changes can have significant impacts.""

Furthermore, the encroachment of human activities, such as agriculture and tourism, has exacerbated the cedar's plight. Land use changes have led to habitat fragmentation, reducing the areas where these trees can grow. In some cases, local communities have cleared land for farming or timber, inadvertently destroying cedar saplings and disrupting the forest ecosystem.

Adding to the cedar's challenges are invasive plant species, notably the Australian rooikrans (Acacia cyclops). This non-native plant competes aggressively for resources like water and nutrients, further stressing the already vulnerable cedar populations. Efforts to control invasive species are ongoing, but they require substantial resources and coordination across conservation groups, government agencies, and local communities.

Despite these challenges, there is hope for the Clanwilliam cedar. Conservationists and researchers are actively working to protect and restore its natural habitat. The CapeNature organization, in collaboration with local stakeholders, has initiated a series of projects aimed at preserving the cedar population. These initiatives include controlled burns to manage invasive species, the establishment of protected areas, and community education programs to promote sustainable land use practices.

""We're committed to ensuring the survival of the Clanwilliam cedar,"" says Dr. Johan van Heerden, a conservationist with CapeNature. ""By involving local communities in conservation efforts and raising awareness about the importance of these trees, we can create a sustainable model for preserving this precious part of our natural heritage.""

Another promising avenue is the cultivation and planting of cedar seedlings in areas where they have the best chance of thriving. These reforestation efforts are crucial for maintaining genetic diversity and ensuring the long-term survival of the species. Researchers are also exploring the cedar's genetic resilience, hoping to identify traits that might help the tree adapt to changing conditions.

Moreover, there is growing interest in the cultural significance of the Clanwilliam cedar. The tree holds historical importance for the indigenous San and Khoikhoi peoples, who have used its wood for tools and shelter for centuries. By highlighting these cultural connections, conservationists aim to foster a deeper appreciation for the cedar and strengthen efforts to protect it.

The plight of the Clanwilliam cedar underscores a broader narrative about the impacts of climate change and human activity on biodiversity. As ecosystems around the world face mounting pressures, the story of the cedar serves as a poignant reminder of the urgent need for conservation action.

The future of the Clanwilliam cedar hangs in the balance, but through concerted efforts and a renewed commitment to environmental stewardship, there is hope that this ancient survivor will continue to stand tall in the Cederberg Mountains for generations to come.",gpt

Trump's ex-top economic adviser: US is in a recession,"In a startling declaration that has sent ripples through economic and political circles, former top economic adviser to President Donald Trump, Kevin Hassett, asserted that the United States is currently in a recession. Speaking at an economic forum on Wednesday, Hassett's comments have reignited debate over the health of the U.S. economy amid ongoing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and global instability.

Hassett, who served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2017 to 2019, argued that key economic indicators suggest a contraction is underway, despite official figures not yet confirming a recession. ""When you look at the data closely, it's evident that we're experiencing significant economic slowdown,"" Hassett stated. ""The signs are there, from declining industrial output to reduced consumer spending. It's time to face the reality.""

His remarks come at a time when the U.S. economy is showing mixed signals. While the job market remains relatively strong, with unemployment hovering near historic lows, other sectors are under pressure. The Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation, sparking fears that these hikes could stifle economic growth and push the economy into a downturn.

Hassett's assertion is particularly significant given his former role in shaping economic policy during a period of significant growth under the Trump administration. His comments suggest a departure from the more cautious optimism expressed by current administration officials, who have pointed to the resilience of the labor market and continued consumer spending as signs of economic strength.

The White House has been quick to respond, attempting to downplay Hassett's assessment. ""We remain confident in the fundamental resilience of the U.S. economy,"" said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""While we acknowledge the challenges posed by global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, our economic policies are designed to safeguard against such downturns.""

Economists are divided on the issue, with some echoing Hassett's concerns while others remain more optimistic. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, acknowledged the headwinds facing the economy but stopped short of declaring a recession. ""We are certainly in a precarious situation, with the balance of risks tilted towards the downside,"" Zandi said. ""However, it is premature to conclude that we're in a full-blown recession without seeing consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.""

The debate over the state of the economy is further complicated by ongoing global challenges. The war in Ukraine, coupled with tensions between the U.S. and China, has disrupted international trade and led to volatile energy prices. These factors have contributed to inflationary pressures, forcing consumers to tighten their belts and businesses to reassess their strategies.

In light of these challenges, the Federal Reserve's role has become increasingly scrutinized. Chairman Jerome Powell has emphasized the need to curb inflation, even if that means tolerating some economic pain. ""Our primary focus is to bring inflation down to our 2% target,"" Powell stated in a recent speech. ""We understand the implications of our actions, but long-term price stability is crucial for sustainable growth.""

Opponents of the Fed's approach argue that aggressive rate hikes risk pushing the economy into a recession. ""The cost of borrowing has risen sharply, affecting everything from home loans to business investments,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. ""This could lead to a pullback in spending and investment, tipping the economy over the edge.""

As the debate continues, Americans are left to grapple with the realities of higher prices and economic uncertainty. For many, the question of whether the country is in a recession is less important than the tangible impacts on their daily lives. Small businesses, in particular, are feeling the pinch, with many reporting decreased sales and rising operational costs.

In the coming months, all eyes will be on the forthcoming economic data releases, which may provide clearer insights into the state of the U.S. economy. Until then, the debate sparked by Hassett's comments will likely remain a focal point in discussions about economic policy and the nation's financial future.",gpt
Pornhub offers quarantined Italians free access,"In an unexpected move aimed at lifting the spirits of millions confined to their homes, Pornhub, the globally renowned adult entertainment website, has announced free access to its premium content for Italian residents under quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiative, which began in March 2020, is part of the company’s efforts to encourage people to adhere to the government’s stay-at-home orders and prevent further spread of the virus.

Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, has seen tens of thousands of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths, leading to stringent measures to contain the disease. With the entire nation under lockdown, residents are facing a prolonged period of isolation with limited opportunities for social interaction and entertainment. In light of these unprecedented circumstances, Pornhub’s gesture has been met with a mix of surprise and appreciation.

The company announced that its premium service, which typically requires a paid subscription, would be available for free to all users in Italy throughout the month of March. This service offers an extensive library of high-definition adult videos and exclusive content, designed to provide a more immersive experience for viewers. By making premium access free, Pornhub aims to provide an additional source of entertainment and distraction for those confined at home.

In a statement released by Pornhub, a spokesperson expressed the company's solidarity with Italy during such challenging times. ""With nearly the entire country in lockdown, Italians have been asked to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. To help them pass the time, we’re opening up our premium service for free during the quarantine.""

The announcement has sparked a variety of reactions on social media, with some users praising the company for its ingenuity and others questioning the appropriateness of the offer. Regardless of differing opinions, it is clear that Pornhub’s initiative has succeeded in capturing public attention and providing a temporary diversion from the grim reality of the pandemic.

In addition to offering free premium access, Pornhub has also pledged to donate a portion of its March proceeds to support Italy’s healthcare system, which has been stretched to its limits by the surge in COVID-19 cases. The company has committed to contributing to both local and national organizations involved in combating the virus, providing much-needed resources to healthcare professionals on the front lines.

Italy’s healthcare system has faced severe challenges as the pandemic has progressed, with hospitals overwhelmed by the number of patients requiring intensive care. Medical professionals have been working tirelessly under immense pressure, and additional funding will be crucial in ensuring they have the necessary equipment and support to continue their life-saving work.

Pornhub’s initiative is a part of a broader trend of companies adapting their services to support communities affected by the coronavirus outbreak. As people around the world adjust to life under lockdown, many businesses have sought innovative ways to contribute positively during the crisis. From streaming services offering free content to fitness apps providing complimentary workouts, the private sector is playing a critical role in helping people cope with the challenges of social isolation.

As Italy continues to navigate the complexities of battling COVID-19, Pornhub’s offer has provided a unique respite for its quarantined population. While the long-term impact of such initiatives remains to be seen, the immediate effect has been one of increased morale and a sense of global community support.

The situation in Italy serves as a stark reminder of the seriousness of the pandemic and the importance of unified efforts to curtail its spread. As the world watches and learns from Italy’s experience, the hope is that similar acts of solidarity and compassion will emerge globally, helping to bridge the gap created by physical distancing and keeping spirits high during these challenging times.

For now, Italians are taking things one day at a time, finding comfort in the small gestures of kindness that continue to emerge amid the darkness of the pandemic. Pornhub’s free premium access is just one of many examples of how companies are stepping up in creative ways to support communities in need, proving that sometimes, a little diversion can go a long way.",gpt
What is a bear market?,"A bear market is a term used to describe a prolonged period of declining prices in any market, but it is most commonly associated with the stock market. This phenomenon is often characterized by a drop of 20% or more from recent highs, signaling a shift in investor sentiment from optimism to fear and pessimism. Understanding the dynamics of a bear market is crucial for investors, financial professionals, and anyone interested in economic trends.

The origins of the term ""bear market"" are not entirely clear, but it is widely believed to have originated from the way bears attack their prey, swiping their paws downward. This imagery reflects the downward trajectory of prices during such market conditions. Historically, bear markets have been a natural part of the economic cycle, often following periods of economic expansion and bullish market conditions.

One of the key features of a bear market is the widespread decline in stock prices, typically across multiple sectors. This decline is often accompanied by negative investor sentiment and a lack of confidence in the economy's future prospects. As prices fall, investors tend to sell off their holdings to minimize losses, further fueling the downward spiral.

Several factors can trigger a bear market, including economic recessions, geopolitical tensions, high inflation, and monetary policy changes. For example, the bear market of 2008 was triggered by the global financial crisis, which was in turn sparked by the collapse of the housing market and the failure of major financial institutions. Similarly, the bear market in early 2020 was largely driven by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread economic disruptions and uncertainty.

During a bear market, investors often turn to defensive strategies to protect their portfolios. Some common approaches include diversifying investments, focusing on stable and dividend-paying stocks, and increasing allocations in bonds and other fixed-income assets. Additionally, some investors may look for opportunities to buy undervalued stocks, betting on a market recovery in the long term.

Bear markets can last for varying lengths of time, ranging from a few months to several years. The duration and severity of a bear market often depend on the underlying economic conditions and the factors that triggered the downturn. For instance, the bear market of 2000-2002, following the dot-com bubble, lasted approximately two and a half years, while the 2008 bear market lasted about 17 months.

Despite the challenges they pose, bear markets are not necessarily a cause for panic. Historically, markets have always recovered, and periods of decline are often followed by bull markets, where prices rise and investor confidence is restored. For long-term investors, staying the course and adhering to a well-thought-out investment strategy is often the best approach to weathering the storm.

It's important to note that not all market declines are classified as bear markets. Short-term declines of less than 20% are often referred to as corrections, which are a normal part of market fluctuations. Corrections can provide valuable opportunities for investors to reassess their portfolios and make strategic adjustments.

For those new to investing, understanding the concept of a bear market is essential to navigating the financial landscape. It highlights the importance of having a diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective. By preparing for the possibility of market downturns, investors can better manage risk and maintain confidence in their investment decisions.

In conclusion, a bear market is a significant, though challenging, phase of the economic cycle that tests investor resilience and strategy. While it can be unsettling to witness declining asset values, history has shown that markets eventually recover, offering new opportunities for growth and investment. By maintaining a balanced approach and focusing on long-term goals, investors can successfully navigate the ups and downs of the financial markets.",gpt
US conducts airstrikes against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq,"In a significant escalation of regional tensions, the United States military carried out airstrikes against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq late Thursday, according to the Pentagon. The strikes, which targeted facilities linked to groups responsible for recent attacks on American forces, underscore the Biden administration's commitment to protecting U.S. personnel and assets in the Middle East.

Pentagon Press Secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed the strikes in a statement, emphasizing that they were a ""necessary and proportionate"" response to ongoing threats. ""The United States will not tolerate attacks against its people, our allies, or our interests,"" Ryder stated. ""These precision strikes were intended to deter future aggression and uphold regional stability.""

The airstrikes reportedly targeted weapons storage and logistics facilities used by the Kata'ib Hezbollah and Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, two prominent Iranian-backed Shiite militia groups. Both groups have been implicated in a series of recent rocket and drone attacks on U.S. installations in Iraq, including the massive Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq, which houses American and coalition forces.

While the Pentagon did not disclose specific details of the operation, Iraqi security sources and witnesses reported explosions in the vicinity of the targeted sites, leading to heightened security measures in the affected regions. There have been no immediate reports of casualties, but the situation remains fluid as authorities continue to assess the aftermath.

The strikes come amid a backdrop of increasing hostilities between the U.S. and Iranian-aligned forces across the Middle East. Tensions have been further exacerbated by the recent collapse of negotiations aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The breakdown in talks has fueled fears of a wider conflict in a region already fraught with instability.

In Washington, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed support for the military action, though some cautioned against entanglement in a broader conflict. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a prominent voice on foreign policy, praised the strikes as ""a clear message to Tehran that aggression will not go unchecked."" Meanwhile, Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) warned that ""while deterrence is crucial, we must also pursue diplomatic avenues to prevent further escalation.""

The U.S. military presence in Iraq, which was significantly reduced in recent years, remains a contentious issue both domestically and internationally. Critics argue that continued military engagement risks drawing the U.S. into a protracted conflict, while proponents assert that it is essential to counterbalance Iranian influence in the region.

The Iraqi government, for its part, condemned the strikes, calling them a ""violation of national sovereignty."" In a statement, the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged all parties to exercise restraint and avoid actions that could destabilize the country. ""Iraq must not become an arena for settling disputes,"" the ministry declared.

Iran, which has long denied direct involvement in attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq, has yet to officially respond to the latest airstrikes. However, analysts anticipate that Tehran and its allied groups may retaliate, potentially setting off a cycle of violence that could further destabilize the region.

The international community is watching the situation closely, with the United Nations and several European nations calling for restraint and renewed diplomatic engagement. ""The region cannot afford another conflict,"" said a spokesperson for the European Union. ""We urge all sides to de-escalate and return to negotiations.""

As the dust settles from the latest military engagement, the path forward remains uncertain. The Biden administration faces the delicate task of balancing firm defense measures with diplomatic efforts to address the broader geopolitical challenges posed by Iran and its allies. The stakes are high, as any miscalculation could have far-reaching consequences not only for the U.S. and Iran but for the entire Middle East.

For now, the world watches anxiously, hoping that cooler heads will prevail and that a peaceful resolution can be found amid the mounting tensions in a region long plagued by conflict.",gpt

With the release of ""Onward,"" Pixar continues its apparent quest to draw tears from audiences worldwide, further cementing its reputation as a master of emotional storytelling.

""Onward,"" directed by Dan Scanlon, is set in a suburban fantasy world and follows two teenage elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, respectively. The film embarks on a heartfelt journey as the brothers attempt to bring back their deceased father for one day using a magical spell. However, as is the case with many Pixar adventures, things do not go as planned.

The film's emotional core is rooted in themes of loss, family, and the universal longing to connect with loved ones who have passed away. It's a sentiment that resonates deeply with audiences, especially those who have experienced similar losses. Pixar's ability to tackle such profound themes with sensitivity and nuance is a testament to its storytelling prowess.

From the outset, ""Onward"" delivers the signature Pixar charm, blending humor and heart in equal measure. The world-building is both imaginative and familiar, with mythical creatures living in a modern-day setting. Unicorns rummage through trash cans, and dragons take the place of household pets, creating a whimsical backdrop that enhances the film's emotional depth.

The journey that Ian and Barley embark on is filled with laughter, danger, and self-discovery. As the brothers navigate obstacles and confront their fears, they learn valuable lessons about bravery, sacrifice, and the importance of cherishing the time we have with loved ones. These themes, while heavy, are presented with a light touch, allowing audiences of all ages to engage with the story.

Pixar's storytelling is complemented by its stunning animation. The vibrant colors and detailed textures bring the fantastical world to life, making the audience feel as if they are part of the journey. The animation studio's dedication to pushing the boundaries of technology ensures that each frame is a visual delight, adding an extra layer of immersion to the emotional narrative.

Critics have praised the voice performances of Holland and Pratt, whose chemistry as brothers is both believable and endearing. Their dynamic adds an extra layer of authenticity to the film, making the emotional moments hit even harder. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer also deliver standout performances, providing depth and humor to their respective roles.

While ""Onward"" is filled with moments of levity, it does not shy away from its emotional core. The film's climax, in particular, is a tear-jerker that reinforces Pixar's commitment to exploring complex emotional landscapes. It is a moment that lingers long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on the relationships that shape our lives.

In recent years, Pixar has increasingly focused on stories that explore deep emotional themes, from the exploration of grief in ""Coco"" to the bittersweet narrative of growing up in ""Inside Out."" ""Onward"" is a continuation of this trend, proving once again that animated films can tackle serious issues with grace and sensitivity.

The film's release comes at a time when audiences are craving stories that offer both escapism and emotional resonance. ""Onward"" delivers on both fronts, providing a fantastical adventure that also encourages viewers to confront their own feelings about loss and family.

As Pixar continues to evolve, its commitment to storytelling excellence remains unwavering. ""Onward"" is a testament to the studio's ability to craft narratives that not only entertain but also inspire and move audiences. It is a film that reminds us of the power of storytelling to heal, connect, and ultimately make us cry.

In the end, ""Onward"" is more than just another animated film; it is a heartfelt exploration of love, loss, and the bonds that tie us together. For fans of Pixar, it is yet another example of the studio's unparalleled ability to tap into the universal emotions that define the human experience. And yes, it is another film that will likely leave you reaching for the tissues.",gpt
Wakayama rafting: It's on logs -- and standing up!,"In the lush, mountainous region of Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, a thrilling and ancient tradition has been drawing both adventurers and cultural enthusiasts to its scenic rivers: log rafting while standing up. This unique form of river navigation, known as ""kawakudari,"" offers not only an adrenaline-pumping experience but also a fascinating glimpse into Japan's historical past.

Wakayama, famous for its picturesque landscapes and the revered Kumano Kodo pilgrimage routes, is now making waves with this extraordinary activity. Unlike typical rafting, where participants are seated in rubber rafts, this variation requires them to balance on wooden logs as they navigate through the rushing waters. This daring adventure is not for the faint-hearted, as it combines the elements of balance, strength, and courage, all while standing upright on a moving log.

The practice of log rafting in Japan dates back to the Edo period (1603-1868), when timber was transported from the forests to various regions via rivers. Skilled loggers, known as ""kawa-nagashi,"" would ride the logs downstream, deftly maneuvering them through rapids and around obstacles. This demanding task required a high level of skill and balance, as falling into the water was a constant risk.

Today, the tradition has been revived as a recreational activity, providing tourists and locals alike with an opportunity to experience a slice of Japanese history. The Wakayama tourism board has embraced this unique offering, promoting it as a must-try adventure for those seeking a different kind of thrill.

Participants are given a crash course in balance and technique before setting off on their journey. Experienced guides accompany the rafters, ensuring their safety while sharing stories of the historical significance of log rafting in the region. The experience begins with a gentle introduction to the river's currents, allowing participants to find their footing, quite literally, on the logs. As confidence builds, the real challenge begins: navigating the more turbulent sections of the river.

One participant, John Smith from Australia, described the experience as both exhilarating and humbling. ""Standing on a log and feeling the power of the river beneath you is something else,"" he said. ""It's a real test of balance and bravery. You gain a newfound respect for the loggers who did this as their daily job.""

The rivers of Wakayama provide the perfect setting for this adventure. They are surrounded by dense forests and towering mountains, offering a serene backdrop that contrasts with the excitement of the ride. The area is also home to diverse wildlife, which can often be spotted along the riverbanks. This adds an element of natural beauty to the experience, making it a memorable adventure for nature lovers and thrill-seekers alike.

Safety, of course, is a top priority. Participants are equipped with life vests and helmets, and the logs are carefully selected to ensure stability. The guides are well-trained in river safety and are prepared to assist in any situation. Thanks to these precautions, incidents are rare, and the focus remains on enjoying the unique experience.

Log rafting in Wakayama is gaining popularity, with more tourists flocking to the region to try their hand at this traditional activity. It is an adventure that appeals to a wide range of people, from young thrill-seekers to older individuals interested in cultural experiences. The activity is typically available from spring through early autumn, when the weather is most favorable.

As Wakayama continues to attract visitors with its natural beauty and cultural heritage, log rafting stands out as a distinctive offering that sets the region apart. For those looking to add a unique twist to their travel itinerary, standing atop a log while navigating the rivers of Wakayama promises an unforgettable adventure that combines history, culture, and excitement.

In a world where conventional rafting has become commonplace, Wakayama's log rafting offers a refreshing alternative. It invites participants to step out of their comfort zones and into a world where balance and bravery meet tradition and nature. As interest in this unique activity grows, it seems poised to become a hallmark of adventure tourism in Japan, drawing intrepid travelers to the rivers of Wakayama for years to come.",gpt
Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"Guinea-Bissau, a small West African nation long troubled by political instability, now faces a new challenge as experts warn that its ongoing political chaos could further entrench its role as a hub in the global cocaine trade. The nation’s porous borders, coupled with weak law enforcement and endemic corruption, have historically provided fertile ground for drug traffickers. As the country grapples with yet another bout of political uncertainty, the risk of increased narcotics trafficking looms large.

In late September, President Umaro Sissoco Embaló dissolved the parliament, citing an intractable political crisis that, according to his statement, has impeded governance and economic development. This move came on the heels of a controversial attempt to change the constitution and has since plunged the nation into further turmoil. The dissolution has led to widespread protests and an uncertain political vacuum, raising fears of a potential power struggle among the military and political elites.

Historically, Guinea-Bissau has been labeled a “narco-state” due to its significant role as a transshipment point for South American cocaine headed to Europe. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has frequently highlighted the country's strategic position on the Atlantic coast as an attractive waypoint for traffickers. With the ongoing political disarray, experts suggest that traffickers may exploit the situation to expand their operations, taking advantage of the lack of effective governance.

""The instability we're witnessing in Guinea-Bissau right now is a boon for criminal enterprises like drug trafficking,"" said Dr. Fatu Camara, a political analyst specializing in West African geopolitics. ""The absence of a functioning government and the potential for military intervention could mean that drug lords will have even less resistance to their operations.""

Despite efforts by the international community, including the European Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to stabilize Guinea-Bissau, progress has been slow. International pressure has often been met with resistance from local power brokers who benefit from the status quo. The lack of political will and resources to combat the influence of drug traffickers has left the nation vulnerable to becoming further enmeshed in the narcotics trade.

Local sources report that in recent months, there has been a noticeable uptick in suspicious maritime activities along the country's extensive coastline. Fishermen have reported seeing vessels drop off packages at sea, which are then collected by smaller boats. These packages are believed to contain cocaine destined for Europe, a claim corroborated by occasional seizures made by the under-resourced national police.

The impact of this drug trade on Guinea-Bissau is profound. The influx of illicit funds often distorts the local economy, leading to inflation and economic disparity. Moreover, the societal impact is devastating, with drug addiction and crime rates rising in communities that lack the means to combat these issues.

In the capital, Bissau, residents express a mix of frustration and resignation. ""We are tired of being known for drugs and corruption,"" said Maria da Silva, a local teacher. ""We want a country where our children can grow up with opportunities and without fear of violence or addiction.""

The international community remains watchful but cautious in its approach. The United Nations has called for calm and dialogue among Guinea-Bissau's political factions, urging them to prioritize national stability above personal interests. Meanwhile, ECOWAS has threatened potential sanctions if the situation does not improve, hoping to pressure leaders into restoring order.

Despite these efforts, the path forward remains uncertain. With parliamentary elections scheduled for early next year, the political climate in Guinea-Bissau will likely remain volatile. The hope is that a peaceful election process could be a step towards stability, providing a foundation for the country to effectively combat drug trafficking.

For now, however, the specter of political chaos continues to haunt Guinea-Bissau, threatening to exacerbate its role in the international drug trade. As the nation stands at a crossroads, the actions of its leaders in the coming months will be crucial in determining whether Guinea-Bissau can break free from the cycle of instability and criminal exploitation that has plagued it for decades.",gpt
Schools knew of trouble before student deaths,"In the wake of a tragic series of student deaths, an investigation has revealed that schools were aware of warning signs long before the incidents occurred. The findings have sparked outrage among parents and community members, who are demanding accountability and immediate action from educational authorities.

The deaths, which occurred over the span of a few months at multiple schools within the district, have left the community in shock and mourning. Parents and students have expressed their grief and frustration, questioning how such tragedies could have unfolded without intervention.

According to internal documents and communications obtained by concerned parties, several schools had been alerted to issues ranging from bullying and mental health struggles to signs of severe distress among the students who later died. Despite these warnings, there appears to have been a lack of coordinated response from the school administration.

One parent, Karen Mitchell, whose daughter was one of the victims, shared her heartbreak and anger. ""We entrusted the schools with our children's safety and well-being,"" she said. ""It is devastating to learn that they knew there were problems and yet did nothing substantial to prevent this from happening.""

Teachers and staff at the affected schools have reported that they did raise concerns with school administrators. These concerns included reports of students being socially isolated, exhibiting drastic changes in behavior, and confiding in staff about feelings of hopelessness. However, many feel their warnings were not taken seriously or were lost in bureaucratic processes.

A teacher who wished to remain anonymous disclosed, ""We flagged these issues multiple times, but there was no follow through. It feels like our hands were tied. We need a better system in place that prioritizes the mental health and safety of our students.""

Mental health experts emphasize the importance of early intervention and the development of comprehensive support systems within schools. Dr. Lisa Carter, a child psychologist, noted, ""Schools are a crucial environment for detecting and addressing mental health issues. Ignoring the signs or failing to act can have dire consequences, as this tragic situation has shown.""

The district's superintendent, Dr. Robert Harris, addressed the community in a press conference, expressing his condolences to the families affected. He acknowledged the shortcomings in the district's response mechanisms and pledged to implement immediate changes. ""We are committed to examining our policies and ensuring that our schools are safe and supportive environments for our students,"" Harris stated. ""We must learn from these tragedies and do everything in our power to prevent them from happening again.""

In response to the revelations, the school district has announced several initiatives aimed at improving student welfare. These include the hiring of additional counselors, implementation of comprehensive mental health education programs, and the establishment of a task force dedicated to reviewing and improving the current reporting and intervention procedures.

Despite these promises, community members remain skeptical. Many are calling for an independent investigation into the schools' handling of the situation and for those responsible to be held accountable. Advocacy groups are also urging for systemic changes at the state level to ensure that all schools have the resources and protocols necessary to address mental health concerns effectively.

The tragedy has reignited a broader conversation about the role of schools in safeguarding student well-being and the urgent need for reform. As the community continues to grapple with the losses, the focus remains on ensuring that no other family has to endure such preventable heartbreak.

As part of the ongoing response, several community organizations have come together to provide support and resources to affected families and students. Vigils and memorials have been held at the schools to honor the memory of the students who lost their lives, serving as a somber reminder of the importance of vigilance and action.

The hope is that these tragic events will serve as a catalyst for meaningful change, prompting schools across the nation to reevaluate their approaches to student safety and mental health. The community's demand for accountability and reform is clear, and the coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining whether these demands are met with genuine action.",gpt
A bipartisan Buttigieg effect? The people of this gorgeous island country say yes,"In a world where political division often overshadows unity, the small island nation of Malta is witnessing an unexpected phenomenon they are calling the ""Buttigieg effect."" Named after U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, whose Maltese ancestry has become a point of national pride, this effect is manifesting in a unique wave of bipartisan collaboration that many believe could serve as a model for other democracies.

Nestled in the Mediterranean, Malta is known for its rich history, stunning landscapes, and strategic location. However, in recent years, the country has also become a symbol of political polarization, mirroring trends seen worldwide. Yet, the narrative is shifting as Maltese citizens increasingly rally around the shared heritage and values embodied by Buttigieg’s rise on the international stage.

Malta's political landscape, traditionally dominated by the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party, has seen a significant transformation in recent months. Political analysts and local leaders attribute this to the ""Buttigieg effect,"" where citizens and politicians alike are inspired to find common ground and focus on policies benefitting the nation as a whole rather than adhering strictly to partisan lines.

At the heart of this change is a renewed emphasis on infrastructure development, efficient governance, and sustainable practices—issues that Buttigieg has championed in his role as the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. During a recent visit to Malta, Buttigieg addressed the Maltese Parliament, emphasizing the importance of collaboration across party lines to tackle the pressing challenges of climate change and technological advancement.

In Valletta, the country's capital, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. “It’s refreshing to see a figure with Maltese roots bring such a positive influence on our political discourse,” said Maria Zammit, a local business owner. “For once, it feels like we are all on the same team, working towards a better future for Malta.”

The spirit of cooperation is evident in several new bipartisan initiatives. One such project is the Comprehensive Transportation and Infrastructure Plan, which aims to modernize Malta’s transportation networks while prioritizing eco-friendly solutions. The plan, which received unanimous support in Parliament, is expected to transform the nation’s roads and public transport systems, reducing congestion and lowering carbon emissions significantly.

The education sector is also seeing the benefits of this newfound unity. Programs promoting digital literacy and vocational training have gained traction, ensuring that Malta’s workforce is equipped to thrive in an increasingly digital world. These initiatives have been applauded for their potential to level the playing field and provide equal opportunities for all Maltese citizens, irrespective of their political affiliations.

Despite the positive momentum, challenges remain. Critics warn that the ""Buttigieg effect"" could be short-lived if not nurtured by continuous efforts from both political leaders and the public. Some skeptics argue that the current unity is more of a temporary truce than a long-term solution, pointing to underlying issues such as economic inequality and migration that still divide the populace.

Political analysts, however, are cautiously optimistic. “While it’s true that Malta faces significant challenges, the willingness of its leaders to come together and address these issues head-on is a testament to the potential of the 'Buttigieg effect,'” noted Dr. Joseph Vella, a professor of political science at the University of Malta. “If sustained, this approach could very well redefine the way politics is conducted in Malta.”

Moreover, the impact of Buttigieg’s heritage and political ethos is resonating beyond Malta’s shores. Other small nations are observing Malta’s progress closely, eager to implement similar strategies in their political systems. As global leaders grapple with divisive issues, Malta’s experiment in bipartisan cooperation could offer valuable lessons.

For now, the people of Malta are enjoying a rare moment of political harmony, hopeful that the spirit of the ""Buttigieg effect"" will continue to inspire positive change. In the words of a Maltese proverb, “Unity is strength; division is weakness.” As Malta charts its path forward, this island nation stands as a beacon of potential, showing the world that even the smallest countries can make a big impact when they come together as one.",gpt
Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights,"In a bold and unprecedented move, Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has taken a decisive step to champion human rights on a global scale. Her latest initiative aims to address some of the most pressing human rights issues of our time, marking a significant moment in her political career and potentially reshaping international dialogue on these critical matters.

Haley, known for her outspoken approach during her tenure at the U.N., has launched a new campaign focused on amplifying the voices of marginalized communities worldwide. This initiative, announced on Thursday, seeks to hold governments accountable for human rights violations while fostering collaboration between nations to address systemic issues such as freedom of speech, women's rights, and racial discrimination.

In a statement released at the launch event, Haley emphasized the need for a renewed global commitment to human rights. ""For too long, the voices of the oppressed have gone unheard,"" she said. ""It's time for a new era of accountability and action. We must stand united in our commitment to uphold the dignity and rights of every individual, regardless of their nationality, race, or creed.""

The initiative, named ""Voices for Equality,"" will operate under a newly formed coalition of international organizations, human rights activists, and policymakers. The coalition aims to create a platform for survivors of human rights abuses to share their stories and advocate for change. It also seeks to build a comprehensive database documenting instances of human rights violations, providing a resource for activists and policymakers to use in their efforts to enact change.

One of the key components of the initiative is a series of international forums intended to foster dialogue among countries with differing human rights records. These forums will serve as a space for open discussion, allowing nations to share best practices and collaborate on solutions to common challenges. Haley has expressed her hope that these forums will foster mutual understanding and encourage countries to take concrete actions to improve their human rights records.

Haley's initiative comes at a time when human rights issues are at the forefront of global discourse. Recent reports of human rights abuses in countries such as Myanmar, China, and Russia have drawn widespread condemnation from the international community. Haley's campaign seeks to address these issues head-on, advocating for stronger international mechanisms to hold perpetrators accountable and protect vulnerable populations.

Critics, however, have questioned the feasibility of Haley's ambitious plan. Some experts argue that the initiative's success will hinge on the willingness of countries with poor human rights records to engage in dialogue and make meaningful changes. Others have raised concerns about the potential politicization of the initiative, cautioning that it could be used as a tool for advancing geopolitical agendas rather than genuinely addressing human rights issues.

Despite these challenges, Haley remains optimistic about the potential impact of her initiative. ""Change is never easy, but it is necessary,"" she remarked during her speech. ""We must be willing to confront uncomfortable truths and challenge the status quo if we are to create a world where every individual is treated with dignity and respect.""

The announcement has been met with a mix of praise and skepticism from the international community. Human rights organizations have welcomed the initiative as a much-needed step forward in addressing global human rights issues. Amnesty International issued a statement commending Haley's efforts, stating, ""This initiative has the potential to bring about meaningful change if implemented with transparency and accountability.""

Meanwhile, some world leaders have expressed cautious optimism about the initiative's potential to foster cooperation and dialogue on human rights. In a joint statement, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, welcomed the initiative, underscoring the importance of multilateral efforts in addressing human rights challenges.

As Nikki Haley embarks on this ambitious endeavor, the world will be watching closely to see if her initiative can indeed bring about the change she envisions. With human rights issues continuing to dominate headlines, her efforts could play a pivotal role in shaping the global conversation and advancing the cause of equality and justice for all.",gpt
Christmas Island: 'A giant robber crab stole my camera',"A holiday adventure on Christmas Island took an unexpected turn for wildlife photographer Tom Parkes when a giant robber crab made off with his camera. Parkes, who was on the island documenting its unique biodiversity, recounted the astonishing incident that has since captured the internet’s imagination.

The extraordinary encounter unfolded during a routine exploration of the island's lush terrain. Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, is renowned for its biodiversity, including the red crab migration, which attracts tourists and scientists alike. However, it was not the famous red crabs that caught Parkes's attention this time, but rather an enormous robber crab, also known as the coconut crab.

The robber crab, the largest terrestrial arthropod in the world, is notorious for its strength and curiosity. These crabs are capable of cracking open coconuts with their powerful claws and are known to explore their surroundings with an opportunistic flair. For Parkes, this meant a surprise theft during a photo session.

""I was setting up my equipment near one of the island's dense forest areas, hoping to capture footage of some of the island's rare bird species,"" Parkes explained. ""Out of nowhere, this massive crab appeared, and before I knew it, it had taken a keen interest in my camera.""

Initially amused by the crab's antics, Parkes quickly realized the creature was serious about its intentions. ""It just grabbed the camera and started dragging it away. I couldn’t believe the strength it had; it was like watching a small bulldozer at work,"" he said.

Parkes's attempts to retrieve his camera were met with a surprising amount of resistance. ""I tried to gently coax it away, but the crab was determined. I had to follow it for quite a bit before I finally managed to retrieve my equipment,"" he recounted with a chuckle. Fortunately, the camera was unharmed, though it bore a few scratches as a testament to its adventure.

The incident was captured on video and quickly went viral, sparking a wave of reactions online. Social media users were both amused and fascinated by the crab’s audacious behavior, some even dubbing the crustacean a ""klepto-crab."" Wildlife experts, however, were not entirely surprised by the incident.

Dr. Emily Watson, a marine biologist specializing in crustaceans, explained, ""Robber crabs are incredibly curious creatures. They're constantly exploring their environment, and anything that catches their eye could become a target for investigation. In this case, the shiny camera must have been irresistible.""

The viral video has not only highlighted the quirky behavior of these remarkable creatures but also shone a spotlight on the unique ecosystem of Christmas Island. Often overshadowed by its larger neighbor, Australia, Christmas Island is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, many of which are found nowhere else in the world.

Tourism officials on the island have welcomed the attention, hoping it will inspire more people to visit and experience the island's natural wonders firsthand. ""We have such a unique ecosystem here,"" said Sarah Tang, a local tourism officer. ""The robber crabs are just one of the amazing species people can encounter. It’s great that this story is bringing awareness to what Christmas Island has to offer.""

For Parkes, the encounter with the robber crab has only deepened his appreciation for the island's wildlife. ""It was an incredible experience, and one I won't soon forget,"" he said. ""It’s a reminder of how amazing and unpredictable nature can be.""

As the story of the camera-snatching crab continues to circulate online, it serves as a charming reminder of the fascinating and sometimes humorous interactions between humans and wildlife. In a world where nature's wonders are often overshadowed by technological marvels, encounters like these remind us of the simple joys and surprises that await in the natural world.",gpt
Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change,"In an era where the planet's climate crisis has reached alarming levels, the role of art in fostering environmental awareness and action is being increasingly recognized. Olafur Eliasson, the renowned Icelandic-Danish artist known for his large-scale installations and sculptures, is at the forefront of this movement, using his artistic prowess to shine a light on climate change and inspire global action.

Eliasson's work, which often incorporates natural elements such as light, water, and air, has always been deeply intertwined with nature. With climate change posing an existential threat to the planet, his art has taken on a more urgent and activist role. Through his installations, Eliasson not only raises awareness about the environmental challenges we face but also suggests that art can be a powerful catalyst for change.

""Art can communicate on a level that transcends the intellectual,"" Eliasson said in a recent interview. ""While scientific data and reports are crucial, art has the ability to touch people's emotions and inspire action in a way that pure facts cannot.""

One of Eliasson's most famous projects, ""Ice Watch,"" exemplifies this philosophy. First installed in Copenhagen in 2014 and later in other cities including Paris and London, the project involved transporting large blocks of glacial ice from Greenland to urban centers, where they were left to melt in public spaces. The melting ice served as a visceral reminder of the impacts of climate change, making the distant and abstract issue of global warming tangible and immediate.

The response to ""Ice Watch"" was profound, sparking conversations about climate change among those who experienced the installation firsthand. Eliasson believes that by engaging the public in this manner, art can play a critical role in bridging the gap between awareness and action.

""Art can create a space for dialogue, for questioning, and for imagining a better future,"" he explained. ""It invites people to think critically about their relationship with the environment and consider what they can do to make a difference.""

Beyond his installations, Eliasson's commitment to environmental sustainability is evident in his studio practices and collaborations. His studio, located in Berlin, operates with a strong emphasis on sustainability, using renewable energy sources and incorporating green practices into its daily operations. Moreover, Eliasson collaborates with scientists, architects, and policymakers to explore innovative solutions to environmental issues.

One such collaboration is ""Little Sun,"" a social enterprise co-founded by Eliasson in 2012. The project provides affordable, solar-powered lamps to communities without access to electricity, promoting renewable energy solutions while improving lives. This initiative not only addresses the immediate needs of underserved populations but also highlights the potential of clean energy as a tool for combating climate change.

Eliasson's approach to art and activism reflects a broader trend in the art world, where artists are increasingly engaging with social and environmental issues. From immersive installations to interactive digital experiences, artists are finding new ways to address the climate crisis and inspire action.

However, Eliasson acknowledges that art alone cannot solve the problem. ""Art is just one piece of the puzzle,"" he noted. ""It must work in tandem with policy changes, scientific advancements, and individual actions to create meaningful impact.""

Despite the challenges, Eliasson remains optimistic about the potential for art to contribute to a more sustainable future. ""Art has the power to change perceptions and inspire hope,"" he said. ""If we can envision a better world, we are one step closer to creating it.""

As the world grapples with the urgent need to address climate change, Eliasson's work serves as a poignant reminder of the role that creativity and imagination can play in shaping a more sustainable future. Through his art, Eliasson not only highlights the pressing issues facing our planet but also inspires individuals and communities to take action.

In a time when the need for environmental action has never been more critical, Olafur Eliasson's art offers a powerful call to arms, urging us to confront the climate crisis with creativity, compassion, and resolve.",gpt
Opinion | ItÃ¢ÂÂs a MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"In an era defined by cultural and political polarization, the intersection of science and ideology has once again taken center stage, this time in an unexpected venue: the realm of microbiology. The latest controversy, dubbed the ""MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"" has ignited a fierce debate over the implications of politicizing scientific research and public health.

The uproar began when a team of researchers published a study examining the potential impacts of climate change on microbial ecosystems, with a specific focus on their effects on agriculture and public health. The study, which appeared in a leading scientific journal, highlighted the accelerated evolution of certain microbial strains in response to rising global temperatures. This could potentially lead to increased resistance to antibiotics and a surge in crop-damaging pathogens.

While the scientific community largely applauded the research for its thorough methodology and urgent relevance, it quickly became a lightning rod for political controversy. Prominent figures associated with the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement have vocally criticized the study, dismissing it as yet another attempt by liberal scientists to push a climate change agenda.

Social media platforms, particularly those frequented by conservative voices, have become battlegrounds for this latest ideological skirmish. Hashtags like #MagaMicrobeMeltdown and #ClimateHoax have trended, with critics arguing that the research is part of a broader scheme to undermine traditional industries and agriculture practices. Some have even suggested that the study’s findings are exaggerated or fabricated to stoke fear and justify increased regulation.

Yet, beneath the din of political rhetoric lies a complex and consequential issue. The intersection of climate change, microbial evolution, and public health is not merely an academic concern. It poses genuine risks that could affect food security, healthcare costs, and global health outcomes. Ignoring these risks, experts warn, would be to our peril.

Public health officials have expressed concern over the politicization of scientific research, emphasizing the need for evidence-based policy decisions. ""Science doesn't adhere to political timelines or ideologies,"" remarked Dr. Emily Carter, a noted epidemiologist. ""The implications of microbial evolution in a warming world are not a matter of belief; they are a matter of evidence.""

The debate over the MAGA Microbe Meltdown highlights a broader trend of scientific discourse being subsumed by partisan politics. It is a trend that poses significant challenges for scientists and policymakers alike. As public trust in scientific institutions wavers, bridging the gap between evidence and public perception becomes increasingly difficult.

The implications of this divide are profound. In a world where misinformation can spread as quickly as a viral tweet, the ability to communicate complex scientific concepts to a skeptical audience is crucial. Yet, as the MAGA Microbe Meltdown illustrates, achieving that balance is fraught with challenges.

This controversy also underscores the urgent need for effective science communication and public education. Initiatives aimed at improving scientific literacy and fostering dialogue between scientists and the public could play a pivotal role in addressing the root causes of these ideological clashes.

Meanwhile, as the debate rages on, the scientific community continues to stress the importance of addressing climate change and its myriad effects. The microbial research at the heart of this controversy, they argue, is but one piece of a larger puzzle that demands attention and action.

In the midst of this ideological tempest, one thing remains clear: the intersection of science and politics is a complex and often contentious space. Navigating it requires a commitment to evidence, open dialogue, and a shared understanding that the stakes are too high to let partisanship prevail over progress.

As the dust settles on the MAGA Microbe Meltdown, the hope is that cooler heads will prevail, allowing for a constructive conversation on the challenges we face and the solutions we must pursue. Science, after all, is not the enemy. It is a tool, one that, if wielded wisely, can guide us through the uncertainties of our rapidly changing world.",gpt
Bernie Sanders plans to stay in the 2020 presidential race,"In a move that defies mounting pressure from within his party, Senator Bernie Sanders announced on Wednesday that he intends to remain in the 2020 presidential race. Despite a string of recent primary losses to former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders remains resolute in his decision to continue campaigning, citing his commitment to the progressive movement and the working-class Americans who have supported his candidacy.

Speaking at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders addressed his supporters and the media, emphasizing that his campaign is more than just a quest for the presidency. “This campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government that works for all, not just the one percent,” Sanders declared, standing behind a podium adorned with his campaign slogan “Not Me. Us.”

Sanders’ decision comes at a critical juncture in the Democratic primary race, as Biden has emerged as the frontrunner following a series of decisive victories in key battleground states. With Biden amassing a significant lead in delegates, many political analysts had speculated that Sanders might bow out to unify the Democratic Party ahead of the general election in November.

However, Sanders remains steadfast, highlighting the importance of continuing the fight for issues such as healthcare reform, income inequality, and climate change—cornerstones of his campaign platform. “I believe that the American people have a right to hear about our progressive vision for the future,” Sanders said, vowing to take his message to the remaining primary states.

The senator’s decision to stay in the race has sparked a mixed reaction among Democrats. While some party leaders and moderate voters are eager to consolidate support around Biden in preparation for the general election against President Donald Trump, Sanders’ loyal base of supporters argue that his presence in the race ensures that progressive policies remain at the forefront of the national conversation.

“Bernie is the only candidate who truly represents the interests of the working class,” said Maria Thompson, a Sanders supporter from Michigan. “We need his voice in this race to push for the changes we desperately need.”

Despite the enthusiasm from his supporters, Sanders faces an uphill battle in the coming weeks. Biden’s recent victories in Michigan, Missouri, and Mississippi have bolstered his delegate count and solidified his status as the presumptive nominee. Moreover, Biden has gained the endorsements of several former Democratic candidates, further consolidating his appeal among a broad swath of the party.

In response to calls for party unity, Sanders expressed his willingness to work with Biden should he become the Democratic nominee. “I have known Joe Biden for many years. He is a decent man and I will do everything in my power to ensure that we defeat Donald Trump,” Sanders stated, while also noting that he intends to hold Biden accountable to the progressive values that have energized his campaign.

Looking ahead, Sanders plans to focus his efforts on the upcoming primaries in states such as Arizona, Florida, and Illinois, where he hopes to regain momentum and demonstrate the enduring appeal of his message. His campaign team has indicated that they will continue to leverage their robust grassroots network to mobilize voters and amplify Sanders’ platform.

The Vermont senator’s decision to remain in the race underscores the ideological divide within the Democratic Party, as progressive and moderate factions vie for influence. While Biden’s campaign seeks to present a unified front against Trump, Sanders’ continued presence serves as a reminder of the diverse perspectives that exist within the party.

As the Democratic primary race unfolds, the stakes remain high for both candidates and their supporters. For Sanders, the path forward is clear: continue advocating for a progressive agenda that challenges the status quo and inspires a new generation of voters to engage in the political process.

Ultimately, Sanders’ decision to stay in the race reflects his unwavering commitment to his principles and his belief in the power of grassroots activism to effect change. Whether or not his candidacy ultimately succeeds, his influence on the Democratic Party and the national political landscape is undeniable.",gpt
Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus,"In a time when the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, the health of global leaders has become a matter of public concern. Among these leaders is former U.S. President Donald Trump, who, as of late, has not been tested for the coronavirus. This situation raises significant questions and concerns about public safety, political transparency, and the potential implications for national and international governance.

The absence of a COVID-19 test for Trump is particularly concerning given his history of close interactions with both national and international figures. During his presidency, Trump was known for holding large rallies and meetings, often with minimal adherence to social distancing guidelines. Such events naturally increase the risk of exposure to the virus, not just for Trump but also for those in his immediate circle and beyond. Without testing, there remains an uncertainty about his health status, which carries potential risks for anyone he might meet or influence.

Moreover, the issue of transparency cannot be overlooked. The health of public figures, especially those who have held or could again hold significant power, is of paramount importance to the public. Previous administrations have set precedents for transparency regarding the health of presidents and presidential candidates. By not undergoing testing, Trump deviates from this norm, leaving many to question what this might imply about his current health and his openness with the public.

Furthermore, Trump's decision not to be tested has broader implications for public health messaging. Throughout the pandemic, health experts and government officials have emphasized the importance of widespread testing as a tool to prevent the spread of the virus. When a prominent figure like Trump opts out of being tested, it risks undermining these public health messages. It sends a mixed signal to the public about the seriousness of the virus and the importance of taking recommended precautions, including regular testing.

The political ramifications cannot be ignored either. Trump remains a highly influential figure within the Republican Party and American politics as a whole. His stance on COVID-19 measures could influence the behavior and attitudes of millions of his supporters. If he continues to eschew testing and downplay the severity of the virus, it could lead to a segment of the population following suit, potentially exacerbating the spread of COVID-19 and hindering efforts to control the pandemic.

Moreover, this situation could impact Trump's political future. If he intends to run for office again, either in 2024 or beyond, the public will likely scrutinize his health and his stance on the pandemic. His decision not to be tested could become a focal point in political debates, potentially affecting voter perceptions and his overall electability.

Internationally, the implications of Trump not being tested extend beyond U.S. borders. As a former president and a key figure in global politics, Trump's actions and health status hold international significance. Other nations may view his decision as reflective of the broader U.S. approach to handling the pandemic, which could influence diplomatic relations and global cooperation efforts in combating COVID-19.

It is also worth considering the ethical implications of Trump's decision. Public figures often have a moral responsibility to set an example for others. By not adhering to recommended health guidelines, including testing, Trump may be perceived as neglecting this responsibility. This perception could further polarize an already divided public, deepening the societal rifts that the pandemic has exacerbated.

In conclusion, the fact that Donald Trump has not been tested for coronavirus matters significantly on multiple fronts. It raises concerns about public safety, transparency, and the effectiveness of public health messaging. Politically and ethically, his decision could have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only his future but also the health and well-being of his supporters and the global community. As the world continues to navigate the challenges posed by COVID-19, the actions of influential figures like Trump will remain under close scrutiny, with their decisions having the potential to shape the trajectory of the pandemic and its resolution.",gpt
How to Use an Instant Pot,"The Instant Pot has revolutionized home cooking with its multifunctional capabilities and ease of use. For those who are new to this kitchen marvel or looking to maximize its potential, understanding how to use it effectively can transform meal preparation from a mundane task into an exciting culinary adventure.

**Setting Up Your Instant Pot**

Before diving into cooking, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with the Instant Pot's components. Typically, an Instant Pot comes with a stainless steel inner pot, a sealing ring, a locking lid, a steam release valve, and a control panel. Begin by ensuring that all parts are clean and properly assembled. Place the inner pot inside the cooker base, and check that the sealing ring is securely in place under the lid to ensure proper pressurization.

Delhi riots: 'No-one who saw the photo thought I would survive',"In the midst of the chaos and violence that engulfed parts of Delhi in February 2020, one photograph came to symbolize the brutality that erupted in the streets. It was an image that stunned the nation and reverberated across the world. In the photo, a young man lies bloodied and battered on the ground, surrounded by chaos and flames. His eyes are closed, his body motionless. Few who saw the image believed he would survive. Yet, against all odds, he did.

For 23-year-old Faizan Khan, the journey from that fateful moment to his current recovery has been long and fraught with challenges. The riots, which erupted over contentious citizenship laws, left over 50 people dead and hundreds injured, tearing apart communities and families. Faizan found himself caught in the crossfire, becoming an unintended symbol of the violence.

""I remember it like a terrible dream,"" Faizan recounts, sitting in the modest family home he shares with his parents and siblings in northeast Delhi. ""I was trying to get home when the crowd turned on me. There was no escape.""

The photograph, taken by a local journalist, shows Faizan lying on the street, his face smeared with blood, his clothes torn. ""The first time I saw it, I was shocked. I didn’t recognize myself,"" he says, his voice shaking slightly. ""It was a miracle that I survived.""

In the days following the attack, Faizan was rushed to a local hospital where he was treated for severe head injuries and multiple fractures. The road to recovery was arduous, requiring extensive medical care and rehabilitation. ""There were days when I thought I would never walk again, never be able to live a normal life,"" he admits.

Yet, with the support of his family and community, Faizan began to heal. ""My family never left my side,"" he says, a hint of gratitude in his eyes. ""Their strength gave me the will to fight.""

The Delhi riots left deep scars in the community, with many residents struggling to rebuild their lives amidst the destruction. While the government pledged aid to the victims, many, like Faizan, relied heavily on local support networks to make ends meet. ""The community came together in an incredible way,"" Faizan notes. ""People opened their homes, shared whatever they had. It was heartening to see such solidarity.""

As Faizan gradually regained his strength, he became determined to use his experience to help others affected by the riots. He now volunteers with a local NGO, providing support and counseling to victims of communal violence. ""I want to give back, to help others find hope in the darkest of times,"" he explains. ""No one should feel alone in their suffering.""

The photograph that captured Faizan's near-fatal encounter has since become a poignant reminder of the human cost of violence. It has been exhibited in galleries and used in campaigns advocating for peace and reconciliation. ""It's strange to think that an image of my pain has such power,"" Faizan reflects. ""But if it helps to prevent future violence, then it was worth it.""

Looking to the future, Faizan is optimistic. He has resumed his studies in engineering, a passion he put on hold during his recovery. ""I want to build a life free from fear,"" he says, determination written on his face. ""And I want to be a voice for peace in my community.""

The journey has not been easy, but Faizan's resilience serves as a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure and overcome. ""I survived for a reason,"" he states firmly. ""And I believe that reason is to help others heal.""

As Delhi continues to heal from the wounds of 2020, stories like Faizan's offer a glimmer of hope. They remind us that even in the face of unimaginable adversity, survival and recovery are possible. In the aftermath of the riots, Faizan Khan stands as a living testament to the power of courage and community.",gpt
What this will cost Mitch McConnell,"In the rapidly shifting landscape of American politics, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell finds himself at a pivotal juncture. As the Republican Party navigates internal divisions, external pressures, and an increasingly polarized electorate, McConnell's leadership is under intense scrutiny. The costs for McConnell—politically and personally—could be significant as he maneuvers through these turbulent times.

Mitch McConnell, a towering figure in Republican politics with over three decades in the Senate, has often been celebrated for his strategic acumen and ability to maintain party discipline. However, recent developments suggest that his once ironclad grip on the GOP is loosening. This shift has come amid growing factionalism within the party, particularly between traditional conservatives and the more populist, Trump-aligned wing.

One of the most immediate costs for McConnell is the erosion of his influence within the party. As former President Donald Trump continues to wield significant sway over the GOP base, McConnell's more traditional brand of conservatism is increasingly seen as out of step with a significant portion of Republican voters. This dynamic was starkly illustrated in the recent primary elections, where several McConnell-endorsed candidates were defeated by Trump-backed contenders. This loss of influence not only weakens McConnell's hand in shaping legislative priorities but also raises questions about his effectiveness in leading the party into the 2024 elections.

Moreover, McConnell's cautious approach to distancing the party from Trump's more controversial rhetoric and policies has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. Democrats argue that McConnell has not done enough to counteract the divisive elements within his party, while some Republicans believe he has been too conciliatory towards Democrats. This balancing act has left McConnell in a precarious position, with his leadership being challenged both internally and externally.

The personal cost to McConnell should not be underestimated. The Kentucky senator, known for his unwavering focus on political strategy, now faces the daunting task of maintaining his legacy while navigating an increasingly hostile political environment. The pressure is compounded by concerns over his health following a series of public incidents that raised questions about his capacity to lead. As McConnell approaches the twilight of his political career, these challenges could tarnish his storied tenure in the Senate.

In the legislative arena, McConnell's ability to advance key Republican priorities is also under threat. With a slim Democratic majority in the Senate, McConnell has had to rely on his negotiation skills to influence policy. However, the internal divisions within his party have made it increasingly difficult to present a united front. This disunity has stalled progress on several key issues, including tax reform, healthcare, and immigration, which are critical to Republican voters.

The financial cost of these political battles is also significant. As McConnell and his allies are forced to pour resources into contested primaries and general elections, questions arise about the long-term sustainability of this approach. The GOP's financial resources are not infinite, and the need to defend seats in competitive states could strain the party's coffers, potentially impacting its ability to compete effectively in the 2024 elections.

As McConnell navigates these challenges, some within the party are beginning to question whether new leadership might be necessary to guide the GOP through its current crisis. While McConnell's tenure has been marked by significant legislative achievements, including the confirmation of three Supreme Court justices, the changing political landscape might require a different approach—one that can bridge the divide between the party's traditional base and its more populist elements.

Ultimately, the cost to Mitch McConnell will be measured not just in political terms, but also in his legacy as a leader. Whether he can adapt to the new realities of American politics and maintain his influence remains to be seen. As the Republican Party stands at a crossroads, McConnell's decisions in the coming months will not only shape his own future but also the future of the GOP as it prepares for the challenges ahead.",gpt
Senate Democrats call for more sanctions against 'Putin's chef' following CNN investigation,"Senate Democrats are intensifying their calls for more stringent sanctions against Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch commonly referred to as ""Putin's chef,"" following a recent CNN investigation that unveiled new allegations of his involvement in global destabilization efforts. The investigation sheds light on Prigozhin's expanding influence and operations, which reportedly include significant interference in various international affairs and election meddling.

The CNN report, published earlier this week, provides detailed accounts of Prigozhin's activities through his shadowy network of companies, including the infamous Wagner Group, a private military contractor accused of carrying out covert operations globally. It also highlights his alleged role in orchestrating disinformation campaigns designed to sway public opinion and disrupt democratic processes, particularly in Africa and Eastern Europe.

Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was among the first to respond to the report, calling for immediate action. ""The findings of this investigation are deeply troubling and demand a robust response from the United States,"" Menendez said in a statement. ""Prigozhin's operations not only threaten the stability of regional governments but also pose a direct threat to the integrity of democratic institutions worldwide.""

Prigozhin, often called ""Putin's chef"" due to his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his past ventures in the catering business, has been a target of U.S. sanctions since 2016. However, Senate Democrats argue that existing measures have been insufficient in curbing his influence. They are now urging the Biden administration to expand sanctions to include more entities and individuals associated with him, as well as to enhance cooperation with international allies in isolating his operations.

The call for increased sanctions comes amid growing concerns over Russia's broader geopolitical strategies. Prigozhin's operations, as outlined in the CNN report, are seen as part of a larger Russian effort to expand its influence globally through unconventional means, including cyber warfare and the use of paramilitary forces.

Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, echoed Menendez's sentiments, emphasizing the need for a coordinated international response. ""This is not just a challenge for the United States; it is a threat to global security and democracy,"" Shaheen stated. ""We must work with our allies to ensure that Prigozhin and his associates are held accountable for their actions.""

In response to the investigation, administration officials have indicated that they are reviewing the findings and considering a range of options. A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that discussions are underway to potentially expand the scope of existing sanctions and explore new avenues for international collaboration.

The CNN investigation has also sparked reactions from European leaders, particularly those in countries most affected by Russian interference. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania called for a unified response to counteract Prigozhin's activities, urging the European Union to take decisive action alongside the United States.

Despite mounting pressure, Prigozhin has consistently denied any wrongdoing. In a statement released through his company, Concord Management and Consulting, he dismissed the CNN report as ""baseless accusations"" and accused Western media of conducting a smear campaign against him and Russia.

As the situation develops, experts warn that the challenge of addressing Prigozhin's influence is complex, requiring not only diplomatic measures but also enhanced cyber defense capabilities and strategic countermeasures. ""Prigozhin represents a new breed of non-state actors who operate in the gray areas of international law,"" said Dr. Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former National Security Council official. ""Effectively countering his operations will require innovative approaches that go beyond traditional sanctions.""

The Biden administration's next steps in addressing the issue will be closely monitored by both domestic and international observers, as they could set a precedent for how the U.S. and its allies confront similar threats from non-state actors and their state sponsors in the future.",gpt

Entertainment & Arts,"In a world where the lines between reality and fantasy continue to blur, the entertainment and arts sector remains at the forefront of innovation and cultural expression. From groundbreaking performances to thought-provoking exhibitions, this vibrant industry is constantly evolving, reflecting the dynamic nature of society itself.

**The Evolution of Storytelling**

One of the most significant trends in entertainment today is the evolution of storytelling. With the advent of digital platforms and technologies, creators are exploring new ways to engage audiences. Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu have revolutionized how we consume stories, offering a vast library of content that caters to diverse tastes and preferences. This shift has not only democratized access to entertainment but also allowed for more varied narratives that challenge traditional norms.

Interactive storytelling has also gained traction, with video games and virtual reality experiences offering immersive narratives that place the audience at the center of the action. Games like ""The Last of Us Part II"" and ""Cyberpunk 2077"" push the boundaries of storytelling, providing players with complex characters and intricate plots that rival those of Hollywood blockbusters.

**The Rise of the Streaming Era**

The rise of streaming has not only changed how audiences consume content but also how creators distribute it. Independent filmmakers and artists now have platforms to showcase their work to global audiences without the need for traditional distribution channels. This has led to a surge in original content that reflects a wider array of voices and experiences.

Moreover, the pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital consumption. With theaters and concert halls shuttered, many performers turned to online platforms to reach their fans. Virtual concerts and performances became the norm, with artists like Billie Eilish and BTS hosting live-streamed events that attracted millions of viewers worldwide.

**Artistic Innovation and Technology**

The integration of technology in the arts has opened new avenues for creativity. Augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are being utilized to enhance artistic expression and create interactive installations that engage audiences in novel ways. Museums and galleries are incorporating AR to offer visitors an immersive experience, allowing them to interact with exhibits in ways previously unimaginable.

AI, on the other hand, is being used to create art itself. Artists are collaborating with AI to generate new forms of visual art, music, and literature. This collaboration between human creativity and machine learning is pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the arts, raising questions about authorship and the nature of creativity.

**Diversity and Representation**

As the entertainment and arts sector continues to evolve, there is a growing emphasis on diversity and representation. The push for inclusivity has led to more opportunities for underrepresented groups to tell their stories. Films like ""Black Panther"" and ""Parasite"" have not only achieved critical acclaim but also highlighted the importance of diverse perspectives in storytelling.

In the arts, movements advocating for marginalized voices have gained momentum, with exhibitions and performances celebrating the works of artists from diverse backgrounds. This shift towards inclusivity is not only enriching the cultural landscape but also challenging institutions to reflect the communities they serve.

**The Future of Entertainment and Arts**

Looking ahead, the future of entertainment and arts appears to be one of continued innovation and adaptation. As technology continues to advance, creators will undoubtedly find new ways to captivate audiences and explore the human experience. The rise of the metaverse, for example, presents exciting possibilities for immersive storytelling and interactive art forms.

However, challenges remain. The industry must navigate issues such as intellectual property rights in the digital age, the sustainability of content creation, and the ethical implications of AI-generated art. Balancing innovation with these concerns will be crucial as the sector moves forward.

In conclusion, the entertainment and arts landscape is a testament to the resilience and creativity of human expression. As it continues to adapt to the changing times, it not only entertains and inspires but also reflects the complexity and diversity of the world we live in. The stories we tell and the art we create will continue to shape our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world, making the entertainment and arts sector an integral part of our cultural fabric.",gpt

Latest Headlines on CNN Business,"**Latest Headlines on CNN Business**

In today's rapidly shifting economic landscape, the headlines from CNN Business paint a vivid picture of the current state of global markets, corporate strategies, and consumer trends. As investors and consumers alike navigate these turbulent times, several key stories have emerged, highlighting both challenges and opportunities across various sectors.

**Tech Giants Face Regulatory Hurdles**

The technology sector, often seen as a bastion of innovation and growth, is currently grappling with intensified regulatory scrutiny. Governments worldwide are stepping up their oversight of tech giants such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. In the European Union, new regulations aimed at curbing monopolistic practices and protecting consumer data are set to come into effect by the end of the year. These measures could significantly impact the business models of these companies, prompting potential shifts in strategy.

In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is pursuing antitrust cases against some of the biggest players in the tech industry. These legal battles could reshape the competitive landscape, offering smaller firms a chance to thrive and innovate. Investors are keeping a close eye on developments, aware that outcomes could influence stock prices and market dynamics.

**Global Supply Chain Woes Persist**

Another pressing issue dominating headlines is the ongoing disruption in global supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the intricate networks that deliver goods worldwide. While some recovery has been observed, challenges persist, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and natural disasters.

A recent report from the World Trade Organization highlights the impact of these disruptions on international trade. Shipping delays and increased costs are affecting everything from consumer electronics to raw materials, leading to price hikes and product shortages. Businesses are re-evaluating their supply chain strategies, with many considering reshoring or diversifying their supplier bases to mitigate risks.

**Retail Sector Rebounds Amid Challenges**

Despite these supply chain issues, the retail sector is showing signs of recovery. As vaccination rates increase and restrictions ease, consumers are returning to physical stores, bolstering sales for traditional retailers. E-commerce, which saw explosive growth during lockdowns, continues to thrive, with companies like Amazon and Alibaba reporting robust earnings.

However, the sector is not without its challenges. Inflationary pressures and labor shortages are squeezing profit margins, forcing retailers to adapt. Some are investing in automation and technology to streamline operations, while others are enhancing employee benefits to attract and retain talent. The holiday season, traditionally a key period for retailers, will be a critical test of their resilience and adaptability.

**Energy Market Turbulence**

The energy market is experiencing significant volatility, driven by fluctuating demand and geopolitical factors. Oil prices have surged to levels not seen in years, fueled by a combination of supply constraints and rising demand as economies reopen. This has led to higher fuel costs for consumers and increased operating expenses for businesses reliant on transportation.

In response, there is a renewed focus on renewable energy sources as countries strive to meet ambitious climate targets. Investment in solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies is accelerating, with companies and governments alike committing to substantial funding. This transition presents both challenges and opportunities, reshaping the energy sector and influencing global economic dynamics.

**Cryptocurrency Volatility Continues**

Cryptocurrencies remain a topic of intense interest and debate. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets have experienced wild price swings, reflecting both speculative trading and broader concerns about regulation and security. Recent moves by countries such as China to crack down on cryptocurrency mining and trading have added to the uncertainty.

Despite the volatility, institutional interest in cryptocurrencies is growing. Major financial firms are exploring ways to integrate digital assets into their portfolios, while several countries are experimenting with central bank digital currencies. The future of cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, but their potential to disrupt traditional financial systems cannot be ignored.

**Conclusion**

These latest headlines from CNN Business underscore the complex and interconnected nature of today’s global economy. As industries evolve and adapt to new realities, businesses and consumers alike must stay informed and agile. With challenges come opportunities, and those who can navigate these turbulent waters will be poised for success in an ever-changing world.",gpt
How virtual reality is changing the live music experience,"Virtual reality (VR) is no longer a futuristic concept confined to the realms of science fiction. Today, it is reshaping industries across the board, and the live music experience is no exception. As technology advances, VR is revolutionizing how artists perform and how fans engage with music, creating immersive experiences that transcend geographical boundaries and redefine the traditional concert paradigm.

For decades, live music has been synonymous with physical presence—fans gathering in crowded venues, stadiums, or festivals to witness their favorite artists perform. However, VR technology is now enabling fans to experience live music from the comfort of their own homes. This shift is not just about convenience; it’s about accessibility and innovation. Fans who are unable to attend concerts due to location, financial constraints, or physical disabilities can now enjoy live performances as if they were in the front row.

One of the most significant advantages of VR in live music is its ability to create an immersive and interactive environment. Unlike traditional concert footage, which offers a passive viewing experience, VR concerts allow fans to interact with the music and the environment. With a VR headset, fans can look around the venue, choose their vantage point, and even interact with virtual elements designed by the artists. This level of immersion can create a more personal and engaging experience, akin to being part of the performance itself.

Artists are also embracing VR to push creative boundaries. With VR, musicians can design elaborate virtual stages and environments that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive to recreate in the real world. These virtual settings can be tailored to enhance the music, providing a multisensory experience that adds depth to the performance. For example, an artist might perform in a fantastical landscape that changes with the music, or a concert might feature interactive visual effects that respond to the audience's movements.

Moreover, VR technology is opening up new revenue streams for musicians and the music industry at large. Virtual concerts can reach a global audience, allowing artists to sell tickets to fans who might never have the opportunity to see them live. Additionally, VR concerts can incorporate unique monetization strategies, such as virtual merchandise, exclusive content, or interactive fan experiences, providing artists with new ways to connect with their audience and generate income.

Despite these exciting developments, the adoption of VR in live music is not without challenges. The technology is still in its relative infancy, and creating high-quality VR content requires significant investment and expertise. Furthermore, the cost of VR headsets and the need for high-speed internet can be barriers for some fans. However, as technology continues to advance and becomes more accessible, these obstacles are likely to diminish.

Another consideration is the impact of VR on the traditional live music experience. While VR offers unparalleled convenience and innovation, it cannot fully replicate the communal atmosphere of a live concert. The energy of a crowd, the spontaneity of live music, and the shared experience of being surrounded by fellow fans are aspects that are difficult to capture in a virtual setting. As such, VR is unlikely to replace traditional concerts entirely but rather complement them, offering new experiences that coexist with live performances.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of virtual alternatives, with artists and fans alike turning to VR as a means of connecting during lockdowns and social distancing measures. As the world emerges from the pandemic, the lessons learned and the innovations developed during this period are likely to continue shaping the future of live music.

In conclusion, virtual reality is transforming the live music experience by making it more accessible, immersive, and innovative. While there are challenges to overcome, the potential of VR to enhance and expand the way we experience music is immense. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the opportunities for artists and fans to connect in meaningful and exciting ways, ushering in a new era of live music that is limited only by imagination.",gpt
"Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up","In an era of mounting global challenges, the coronavirus pandemic has provided a unique avenue for world leaders to consolidate power, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the forefront of this maneuver. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, U.S. President Donald Trump finds himself facing a different reality, grappling with the complexities of managing the crisis domestically while contending with fluctuating political fortunes.

In Russia, President Putin has adeptly used the pandemic to reinforce his grip on power. In the initial stages of the outbreak, the Kremlin's swift response in imposing lockdowns and public health measures was lauded both domestically and internationally. Capitalizing on this, Putin pushed through constitutional amendments that could potentially extend his presidency until 2036. These moves, framed as necessary for stability during uncertain times, have resulted in a tighter consolidation of power, with critics voicing concerns over the erosion of democratic norms.

Similarly, in China, President Xi Jinping has leveraged the crisis to bolster the Communist Party's control. The Chinese government's approach to the pandemic, marked by strict lockdowns and aggressive public health campaigns, has been portrayed as a triumph of the centralized state. This narrative has not only strengthened Xi's position domestically but also allowed China to project itself as a model for managing the pandemic on the global stage. The emphasis on national unity and economic recovery has further reinforced the party's dominance, with dissenting voices increasingly marginalized.

While Putin and Xi have seized the opportunity to tighten their control, President Trump has faced a more turbulent path. The pandemic's rapid spread across the United States has posed significant challenges to the Trump administration, revealing cracks in the country's public health infrastructure and sowing political discord. Initial attempts to downplay the severity of the virus were met with criticism, and subsequent efforts to manage the crisis have been hampered by inconsistent messaging and political infighting.

As the U.S. grappled with surges in COVID-19 cases, Trump found himself at odds with state governors, health officials, and even members of his own party. The lack of a coordinated federal response, coupled with the president's frequent clashes with experts, has fueled a perception of disarray. This has been further compounded by the economic fallout from the pandemic, with millions of Americans facing unemployment and uncertainty.

The contrasting approaches of these global leaders highlight the varying strategies employed in response to the coronavirus crisis. Putin and Xi's ability to utilize the pandemic as a tool for political consolidation stands in stark contrast to the challenges faced by Trump, whose handling of the crisis has become a focal point of his presidency.

Internationally, the ramifications of these dynamics are profound. Russia and China have not only strengthened their domestic positions but are also extending their influence globally. Russia's distribution of its Sputnik V vaccine to numerous countries and China's deployment of medical supplies and expertise have been part of broader efforts to enhance their geopolitical standing. These initiatives, framed as humanitarian aid, also serve to bolster alliances and expand spheres of influence.

In contrast, the United States, traditionally a leader in global health crises, has been conspicuously absent from the forefront of the international response. The Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization and prioritize ""America First"" policies has left a vacuum in global health leadership, one that Russia and China are keen to fill.

As the world continues to navigate the complexities of the pandemic, the approaches of Putin, Xi, and Trump offer a study in contrasts. While the former two have capitalized on the crisis to fortify their power, the latter faces an uphill battle to regain control and restore confidence. The outcomes of these strategies will not only shape the political futures of these leaders but also influence the global order in the post-pandemic world.",gpt
How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus,"In the era of the coronavirus pandemic, maintaining personal hygiene has become more critical than ever. While most people are focusing on washing their hands and wearing masks, one essential aspect often overlooked is the cleanliness of our smartphones. These devices accompany us everywhere, making them potential carriers for viruses and bacteria, including the coronavirus. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to clean your phone effectively to help protect yourself against coronavirus.

### The Importance of Cleaning Your Phone

Smartphones are among the most frequently touched objects in our daily lives. According to research, our phones can harbor more germs than a toilet seat. Given the amount of contact they have with our hands, face, and various surfaces, they can be a hotspot for the spread of viruses. Regular cleaning of your phone is crucial in reducing this risk.

### Tools You Will Need

Before you start the cleaning process, gather the necessary tools. You will need:

- Microfiber cloth
- Isopropyl alcohol (70% concentration or higher)
- Cotton swabs
- Distilled water
- Small spray bottle

### Step-by-Step Cleaning Process

#### Step 1: Power Down Your Device

Begin by turning off your phone. This step is crucial to prevent any damage during the cleaning process and to ensure safety.

#### Step 2: Remove the Case

If your phone is encased, carefully remove the case. Both the phone and the case need cleaning to ensure thorough disinfection.

#### Step 3: Prepare the Cleaning Solution

Mix equal parts of distilled water and isopropyl alcohol in a small spray bottle. This solution is effective in killing germs without damaging your phone's screen or components.

#### Step 4: Wipe Down the Phone

Spray the cleaning solution onto a microfiber cloth – never directly onto the phone – and gently wipe down all surfaces of your phone. Pay particular attention to high-touch areas such as the screen, sides, and back. Microfiber cloths are ideal because they don’t scratch surfaces and are effective at lifting dirt and germs.

#### Step 5: Clean the Crevices

Use a cotton swab slightly dampened with the cleaning solution to clean around buttons and ports. These areas can accumulate dirt and grime, making them potential breeding grounds for germs.

#### Step 6: Allow to Air Dry

After wiping down the phone, let it air dry completely before turning it back on. This step ensures that all the alcohol has evaporated and that no moisture remains that could potentially damage your device.

#### Step 7: Clean the Phone Case

Don’t forget the phone case. Use the same cleaning solution to wipe down the case thoroughly, ensuring that the interior and exterior are disinfected. If your case is made of a material that can withstand it, consider washing it with soap and water for added cleanliness.

### Tips for Maintaining a Clean Phone

- **Regular Cleaning:** Make it a habit to clean your phone at least once a day, especially during periods of heightened virus transmission.
- **Avoid Sharing Phones:** Limit the sharing of your device with others. If sharing is necessary, clean the phone immediately afterward.
- **Practice Good Hand Hygiene:** Wash your hands frequently and use hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available. Clean hands will reduce the transfer of germs to your phone.
- **Use a Stylus or Hands-Free Features:** Minimize direct contact by using a stylus or voice-activated features when possible.

### What to Avoid

- **Harsh Cleaners:** Avoid using bleach, vinegar, or any cleaning products not specifically designed for electronics, as they can damage the phone’s screen and components.
- **Excessive Moisture:** Ensure that your cloth or cotton swab is not too wet to prevent moisture from seeping into openings.
- **Direct Spraying:** Never spray cleaning solutions directly onto your phone to avoid liquid damage.

Keeping your smartphone clean is a straightforward but effective measure to protect yourself against the coronavirus. By incorporating these cleaning practices into your daily routine, you can help minimize the risk of virus transmission and promote better hygiene in your everyday life.",gpt
Coronavirus shows up Trump's compassion deficit,"As the coronavirus pandemic swept across the globe, world leaders found themselves thrust into a spotlight demanding empathy, swift action, and reassurance. Nations looked to their heads of state for guidance and compassion, hoping to see a reflection of their own fears and uncertainties acknowledged and addressed. In this crucible of leadership, one figure stood out in stark contrast: former President Donald Trump.

Throughout his tenure, Trump was often criticized for his brusque demeanor and lack of empathy. However, it was during the coronavirus crisis that these traits were underscored with unprecedented clarity. As the virus spread, claiming lives and livelihoods, the former president's response was met with growing scrutiny, revealing what many have termed a ""compassion deficit.""

From the outset, Trump’s handling of the pandemic was marked by downplaying the virus's severity. In late February 2020, he assured the public that the number of cases would soon drop to zero, despite warnings from health experts. This initial dismissal sowed confusion and undermined efforts to rally the nation around necessary preventive measures. To Trump's critics, this was a glaring example of his inability to empathize with the gravity of the situation.

Press briefings, typically an opportunity for leaders to communicate empathy and solidarity, became contentious under Trump’s watch. His interactions with journalists were often combative, deflecting difficult questions with a mix of bravado and defensiveness. For those seeking reassurance, these exchanges offered little comfort. Instead of unifying rhetoric, the administration often presented conflicting messages, leaving many Americans feeling adrift during a time of crisis.

The contrast between Trump and other world leaders was particularly striking. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for example, won praise for her empathetic communication style and decisive action, which included early lockdowns and clear guidelines. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with her scientific background, delivered calm, factual updates that conveyed both concern and competence. These leaders became symbols of reassurance and stability, effectively filling the emotional void that many felt from the former U.S. administration.

One of the most telling moments came during Trump’s response to the human toll of the virus. As the death toll mounted, reaching grim milestones, Trump often pivoted to discussions about the economy or personal grievances. His critics argued that his focus on stock market performance and electoral prospects overshadowed the profound personal losses being suffered by millions of Americans.

Moreover, Trump's rallies during the pandemic, which often flouted public health guidelines, sent a mixed message to the public. They became emblematic of his approach—prioritizing political gain over public health. The optics of large, maskless gatherings clashed sharply with the somber reality faced by healthcare workers and families affected by COVID-19.

To be fair, Trump's administration did oversee efforts to expedite vaccine development through Operation Warp Speed, a significant achievement that should not be overlooked. However, the successes in vaccine production were often overshadowed by issues in distribution and public messaging. The lack of a cohesive national strategy on vaccine rollout further highlighted the administration’s struggle to exhibit the kind of compassionate leadership many Americans were yearning for.

In the end, the coronavirus pandemic became a litmus test for leadership on the global stage. It magnified the strengths and weaknesses of those in power. For Donald Trump, it underscored a compassion deficit that many felt was present throughout his presidency but became glaringly apparent during this unprecedented crisis.

As the world continues to navigate the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19, the importance of empathetic leadership has never been more evident. Leaders who can balance action with compassion, who can validate their citizens’ fears while providing a clear path forward, are more likely to emerge with both political and public trust intact. For Trump, the pandemic highlighted a critical gap in his leadership style—one that, for many, left a lasting impression of a missed opportunity to connect with the very people he was elected to serve.",gpt
New 'Jungle Bubbles' invite travelers to sleep next to elephants in Thailand's Golden Triangle,"In the heart of Southeast Asia, a unique and immersive travel experience is drawing adventurers from around the globe to Thailand’s Golden Triangle. Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort has introduced an innovative concept that allows guests to sleep in transparent ""Jungle Bubbles,"" offering an unprecedented opportunity to observe elephants in their natural habitat.

Perched on the lush hills overlooking the confluence of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar, these Jungle Bubbles are the latest addition to the resort’s efforts to combine luxury with wildlife conservation. Crafted from high-tech polyester fabric, these air-conditioned, dome-shaped accommodations offer panoramic views of the surrounding jungle and its majestic inhabitants.

Each bubble is fully equipped with a king-size bed, an ensuite bathroom, and a cozy seating area, ensuring that guests experience both comfort and serenity. The transparency of the bubbles allows for an uninterrupted, 360-degree view of the elephants as they meander through the forest, forage for food, and interact with each other, providing an intimate glimpse into their daily lives.

The elephants residing in the Golden Triangle are part of a long-term conservation project aimed at protecting the region’s dwindling elephant population. Many of these elephants have been rescued from harsh conditions in the tourism and logging industries. The introduction of the Jungle Bubbles is a part of Anantara’s mission to promote ethical and sustainable tourism, raising awareness about elephant welfare while offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Guests are escorted to their bubbles after dusk, ensuring minimal disturbance to the elephants during their daytime activities. The experience promises not only a visual spectacle but also a profound sense of connection with nature. While reclining under a starry sky, guests can listen to the symphony of jungle sounds, punctuated by the occasional trumpet or rumble from these gentle giants.

Since their launch, the Jungle Bubbles have attracted significant attention from eco-conscious travelers and influencers alike, eager to share their nocturnal adventures with a global audience. Social media platforms have been flooded with breathtaking images and videos of elephants roaming mere feet away from the transparent walls, drawing curiosity and admiration from potential visitors around the world.

John Roberts, the Director of Elephants and Conservation Efforts at Anantara, emphasized the importance of initiatives like the Jungle Bubbles in promoting sustainable tourism. “Our goal is to create a meaningful encounter between our guests and these magnificent creatures, fostering a deeper understanding and respect for wildlife conservation,” Roberts explained. “By offering an authentic and responsible way to observe elephants, we hope to inspire a new generation of wildlife advocates.”

However, the resort’s innovative approach to tourism has not been without its challenges. The delicate balance between offering a luxury guest experience and ensuring the safety and well-being of the elephants requires continuous monitoring and adaptation. The resort has implemented strict guidelines to minimize human-elephant interaction, and trained staff are on hand to ensure that the elephants’ natural behaviors are not disrupted.

The success of the Jungle Bubbles could pave the way for similar initiatives in other parts of the world, highlighting the growing demand for eco-friendly tourism options that prioritize animal welfare. As more travelers seek to minimize their environmental impact, experiences like these offer a model for how luxury and conservation can coexist harmoniously.

For those eager to embark on this extraordinary journey, reservations for the Jungle Bubbles are open year-round, though availability is limited due to high demand. Prices for an overnight stay start at approximately $600, a small price to pay for the privilege of sleeping amid some of Earth’s most magnificent creatures.

As the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change and habitat loss, initiatives like the Jungle Bubbles offer a glimmer of hope. By fostering a deeper connection between humans and wildlife, they remind us of the importance of preserving our planet’s natural treasures for future generations.",gpt
Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary,"In a heart-wrenching blow to global conservation efforts, two rare white giraffes, a mother and her calf, were found dead in a Kenyan wildlife sanctuary, victims of poaching activity. The unique giraffes, famous for their distinctive pale coats, were located at the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy in Garissa County, a region that has been at the forefront of wildlife preservation. The tragic loss has sent shockwaves through the conservation community and reignited urgent discussions about wildlife protection and anti-poaching measures.

The white giraffes, not albino but exhibiting a condition known as leucism, were a significant draw for the sanctuary, attracting tourists and researchers eager to study their rarity. Leucism is a genetic condition that causes a partial loss of pigmentation in an animal, resulting in a pale, almost ghostly appearance. These giraffes were among the only known white giraffes in the world, making their presence in Kenya a point of national pride and international interest.

Rangers at the conservancy discovered the carcasses during a routine patrol, and initial investigations suggest that poachers were responsible for their deaths. The precise motives of the poachers remain unclear, but it is suspected that the animals were targeted for their skin, which could fetch a high price on the black market due to its rarity. The devastating incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by conservationists in protecting endangered and unique wildlife from illegal hunting activities.

""This is a sad day for the community and Kenya as a whole. We are the only community in the world who are custodians of the white giraffe,"" said Mohamed Ahmednoor, the manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy. ""Its killing is a blow to the tremendous steps taken by the community to conserve rare and unique species and a wake-up call for continued support to conservation efforts.""

The Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, established in 2012, has been a beacon of hope in the preservation of endangered species, including the critically endangered Hirola antelope. The conservancy has also been instrumental in promoting eco-tourism, which has provided much-needed economic support to local communities. The presence of the white giraffes was a symbol of their successful conservation efforts and a reminder of the delicate balance between human activity and wildlife preservation.

This incident has stirred a renewed call for strengthening anti-poaching laws and increasing the resources allocated to wildlife protection. Conservationists are advocating for more robust surveillance systems, including the use of drones and advanced tracking technology, to monitor wildlife in remote areas. Moreover, there is an urgent need for international collaboration to dismantle poaching networks and address the demand for illegal wildlife products.

In recent years, Kenya has made significant strides in wildlife conservation, implementing stricter penalties for poachers and investing in community-based conservation projects. However, the loss of these iconic giraffes is a stark reminder of the persistent threats faced by wildlife in the region.

The Kenyan government has condemned the poaching incident and vowed to intensify efforts to ensure the safety of the country's wildlife. ""The loss of these giraffes is not just a loss for Kenya but for the entire world. We must work together to ensure such tragedies do not happen again,"" said Najib Balala, Kenya's Minister of Tourism and Wildlife.

In the wake of this tragedy, conservation groups are rallying to honor the memory of the white giraffes by redoubling their efforts to protect other rare species. This includes enhancing community awareness programs to educate locals about the importance of wildlife conservation and the long-term benefits it brings to their communities.

The international community is also being urged to support Kenya's conservation initiatives through funding and expertise, emphasizing that the protection of biodiversity is a global responsibility. As the world mourns the loss of these extraordinary creatures, the call to action has never been more urgent.

The story of the white giraffes, though ending tragically, serves as a powerful reminder of the fragility of nature and the collective responsibility to safeguard our planet's most precious and vulnerable inhabitants.",gpt
Flu leaves a 4-year-old girl blind in Iowa,"In a heartbreaking turn of events, a 4-year-old girl from Iowa has been left blind after battling a severe case of the flu, highlighting the potential seriousness of influenza and the importance of vaccination as flu season approaches.

The young girl, Jade Smith, from Des Moines, was a healthy and vibrant child before she fell ill just a few weeks ago. Her parents, Tom and Lisa Smith, initially thought Jade had come down with a common cold. However, her condition rapidly deteriorated, prompting them to rush her to the hospital.

Doctors at MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center were quick to diagnose Jade with a severe strain of influenza, which had unfortunately led to acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), a rare but serious complication of the flu. ANE is an inflammatory disease that affects the brain and can result in significant neurological damage.

Dr. Sarah Williams, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at MercyOne, explained, ""While it's uncommon, influenza can sometimes lead to severe complications beyond the typical respiratory symptoms we associate with the flu. In Jade's case, the virus caused inflammation in her brain, leading to the tragic outcome of her blindness.""

Jade's parents are devastated but are determined to raise awareness about the severity of the flu and the critical importance of vaccination. ""We had no idea the flu could do something like this,"" said Lisa Smith. ""Our world has been turned upside down, but we want other parents to know that the flu is not something to take lightly.""

Health officials are using this unfortunate incident as a reminder of the importance of annual flu vaccinations, especially for young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone over the age of six months receive a flu vaccine each year.

Dr. John Cartwright, chief medical officer at the Iowa Department of Public Health, emphasized, ""Vaccination is our best defense against the flu. It may not always prevent the flu, but it can significantly reduce the severity of the illness and the risk of complications like those experienced by Jade.""

According to recent data from the CDC, flu vaccination rates in Iowa have been lower than the national average, with only about 52% of the eligible population receiving the vaccine last year. This statistic has prompted local health officials to intensify their efforts to encourage vaccination, particularly among children and at-risk populations.

In response to Jade's case, MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center has launched a community outreach program to provide free flu vaccinations to families in the area. The initiative aims to ensure that more people, especially those in underserved communities, have access to the vaccine.

The Smith family is now focused on adapting to their new reality. They are working with a team of specialists to help Jade adjust to her loss of sight and to provide her with the resources she needs to thrive. ""Jade is a fighter,"" said her father, Tom. ""She's already learning how to use a cane and starting to read braille. Her resilience is incredible, and we are so proud of her.""

The community has rallied around the Smith family, offering support and raising funds to assist with Jade's medical expenses and future needs. A GoFundMe page set up by friends and family has already raised over $50,000.

As Jade continues her recovery, her story serves as a sobering reminder of the flu's potential to cause serious harm. Health professionals are urging everyone to take preventive measures seriously, including practicing good hygiene, staying home when sick, and, most importantly, getting vaccinated.

The Smith family hopes that by sharing their story, they can prevent other families from experiencing a similar ordeal. ""We can't change what happened to Jade,"" said Lisa Smith, ""but if we can help save even one child from going through this, then sharing our story is worth it.""

Jade's journey is a testament to the unpredictable nature of the flu and a call to action for communities to prioritize vaccination and awareness as the flu season begins in earnest.",gpt
The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"In the modern landscape of political and social influence, where hard power often overshadows subtler forms of impact, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s decorative collars—or jabots—served as a unique emblem of soft power. Despite their understated nature, these collars became a symbol of dissent, empowerment, and cultural dialogue, transcending the boundaries of the U.S. Supreme Court to inspire a global audience.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, affectionately known as RBG, was celebrated for her groundbreaking work in gender equality and civil rights. However, her legacy extends beyond her judicial achievements. The collars she wore over her traditional black robes became a silent but powerful communicator of her beliefs, serving as visual statements that resonated far beyond the courtroom.

Each collar Ginsburg donned had its own story and significance. For instance, her “dissent collar,” a beaded and spiked necklace from Banana Republic, became infamous as the accessory she wore when reading dissents from the bench. This collar was not just a piece of jewelry; it was a subtle yet potent form of protest. It signaled to the world that Ginsburg was unafraid to stand against the majority, embodying her role as a defender of justice and equality. This simple act of sartorial expression empowered countless individuals to embrace their voices, particularly women in male-dominated fields.

The impact of Ginsburg’s collars was further amplified by the visual culture of the digital age. Social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram became powerful conduits for disseminating her image, with the collars serving as a focal point for memes, illustrations, and tributes. Hashtags like #NotoriousRBG and #DissentCollar became rallying cries for movements advocating for women’s rights and social justice. Through these platforms, Ginsburg’s influence permeated diverse demographics, reaching younger generations who may not have otherwise engaged with judicial or political discourse.

Moreover, Ginsburg’s collars played a significant role in the cultural representation of women in leadership. Traditionally, the attire of Supreme Court Justices has been uniform and austere, reflecting the gravity of their roles. However, Ginsburg’s incorporation of decorative collars challenged this convention, introducing an element of individuality and femininity into the judiciary’s visual narrative. This not only humanized her image but also redefined the traditional perceptions of power and authority. By doing so, she inspired women across professions to embrace their identities within their roles, proving that femininity and authority are not mutually exclusive.

In addition to their cultural significance, Ginsburg’s collars spurred discussions on the intersection of fashion and politics. Fashion has long been dismissed as superficial or frivolous, yet Ginsburg demonstrated its potential as a form of non-verbal communication with profound implications. Her collars became a case study in how personal style can convey powerful messages, challenging societal norms and advocating for change. This realization has encouraged a broader appreciation for the role of fashion in socio-political contexts, prompting individuals and organizations to consider how attire can be leveraged as a tool of influence.

The legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s decorative collars continues to reverberate through various mediums. Museums and exhibitions have showcased her collars, preserving them as artifacts of cultural and historical significance. These displays serve not only as tributes to her legacy but also as educational tools, inviting visitors to explore the stories and symbols behind each piece. They encourage reflection on how seemingly small choices can have wide-reaching impacts, promoting dialogue on the values and principles Ginsburg championed.

In conclusion, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s decorative collars exemplify the power of soft influence in shaping cultural narratives and inspiring change. Through her thoughtful selection of these accessories, Ginsburg communicated messages of dissent, empowerment, and individuality that resonated across the globe. Her legacy serves as a testament to the impact of subtlety in a world often dominated by overt displays of power, reminding us that sometimes, the most powerful statements are made without words. As society continues to navigate complex social and political landscapes, the lessons imparted by Ginsburg’s iconic collars remain ever relevant, encouraging a new generation to harness the power of personal expression in the pursuit of justice and equality.",gpt
Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure,"In recent years, the chocolate industry has been grappling with an unsavory truth: a significant portion of the world's cocoa supply is tainted by child labor and slavery. As awareness of these issues grows, a burgeoning movement to produce ""slave-free"" chocolate is gaining momentum, offering consumers a not-so-guilty pleasure that aligns with ethical consumption.

The dark side of chocolate production has been well-documented, particularly in West Africa, which supplies about 70% of the world's cocoa. Here, thousands of children are forced to work under hazardous conditions, often for little or no pay. Efforts to combat these abuses have been ongoing, but progress has been slow, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of conscientious consumers.

However, the tide is turning as more companies commit to ethical practices. Brands such as Tony’s Chocolonely, Divine Chocolate, and Alter Eco have emerged as pioneers in the slave-free chocolate movement. These companies have made it their mission to eliminate child labor and ensure fair wages for farmers by establishing transparent, traceable supply chains.

Tony’s Chocolonely, founded in 2005, has been at the forefront of this movement. The company was born out of a journalistic investigation into the cocoa industry, which revealed the widespread use of child labor and slavery. Today, Tony’s Chocolonely aims to produce chocolate that is not only delicious but also free from exploitation. The company works directly with cocoa farmers in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, paying them a premium price for their beans. This approach not only ensures a living wage for farmers but also incentivizes sustainable farming practices.

Similarly, Divine Chocolate, a British brand co-owned by the Kuapa Kokoo cooperative in Ghana, empowers farmers by giving them a stake in the company. This unique business model provides farmers with a share of the profits and a say in business decisions. By prioritizing the welfare of farmers and their communities, Divine Chocolate offers a compelling alternative for consumers seeking to make ethical choices.

Alter Eco, another prominent player in the slave-free chocolate sector, focuses on environmental sustainability and social justice. The company sources its cocoa from farmer-owned cooperatives in Ecuador and Peru, ensuring that producers receive fair compensation. Alter Eco is also committed to reducing its environmental footprint, using compostable packaging and supporting reforestation initiatives in cocoa-growing regions.

The rise of slave-free chocolate is not just a boon for farmers; it also resonates with consumers who are increasingly concerned about the ethical implications of their purchases. According to a 2022 survey by the National Confectioners Association, nearly 70% of consumers expressed a preference for purchasing chocolate from companies that adhere to fair labor practices.

Retailers are responding to this shift in consumer sentiment by stocking more ethically produced chocolate products. Major chains such as Whole Foods, Target, and even mainstream supermarkets are expanding their offerings of slave-free chocolate, making it more accessible to the average shopper.

While the slave-free chocolate movement is gaining traction, challenges remain. Ensuring the integrity of supply chains in regions plagued by poverty and corruption is no small feat. Certification systems such as Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance provide some assurance, but critics argue that these labels do not always guarantee slave-free products.

Moreover, the demand for cheap chocolate remains high, and many consumers are unwilling or unable to pay the premium prices associated with ethically produced chocolate. Bridging this gap requires not only consumer education but also systemic changes within the industry.

Despite these hurdles, the momentum behind slave-free chocolate is undeniable. As more companies and consumers embrace ethical practices, the industry is slowly transforming, offering a glimmer of hope for a future where chocolate is truly a not-so-guilty pleasure.

In the meantime, consumers can play their part by voting with their wallets. By choosing to support brands that prioritize ethical sourcing and fair labor practices, they can help drive change and ensure that the joy of indulging in chocolate comes without the bitter aftertaste of exploitation.",gpt
Firefighters Cut 2 People Out Of Vehicle After Rollover Crash In Manteca,"In a dramatic rescue operation on Friday evening, firefighters in Manteca successfully extricated two individuals trapped inside a vehicle following a severe rollover crash on Highway 120. The incident, which occurred around 6:15 p.m., sparked a swift emergency response and temporarily halted traffic as rescue teams worked tirelessly to free the victims.

According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the crash involved a single vehicle that appeared to lose control, flipping multiple times before coming to a rest on its roof. Preliminary reports suggest that the driver may have been attempting to navigate a sharp curve at high speed, a factor that is currently being investigated as a possible cause of the accident.

Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with the vehicle skidding across the highway before tumbling into the adjacent ditch. ""It was terrifying to watch,"" said Maria Hernandez, who was driving behind the ill-fated car. ""The car just flipped over several times. I immediately pulled over and called 911.""

First responders, including units from the Manteca Fire Department and the CHP, arrived at the scene within minutes. Firefighters quickly assessed the situation and found two occupants—a male driver and a female passenger—trapped inside the overturned vehicle. Both individuals appeared conscious but were unable to free themselves from the mangled wreckage.

Utilizing hydraulic rescue tools, commonly referred to as the ""Jaws of Life,"" firefighters meticulously cut through the vehicle's crumpled frame. The extrication process took approximately 30 minutes as rescuers worked carefully to ensure the safety of the trapped individuals. ""Our primary concern was to stabilize the vehicle and prevent further injury to the occupants,"" said Fire Chief Brian Estes, who oversaw the rescue operation. ""The situation was challenging due to the vehicle's position and the extent of the damage.""

Once freed, the driver and passenger were immediately assessed by paramedics on the scene. They were subsequently transported to a nearby hospital, where they remain under observation. The extent of their injuries has not been disclosed, but officials have confirmed that both individuals were alert and communicative during the rescue.

In the aftermath of the incident, authorities temporarily closed a section of Highway 120 to facilitate the rescue operation and clear the debris. Traffic was diverted through alternate routes, causing minor delays for evening commuters. The highway was reopened after approximately two hours, following a thorough cleanup and investigation of the crash site.

The California Highway Patrol continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding the accident. While excessive speed is being considered as a possible factor, investigators are also examining other potential causes, including mechanical failure and driver impairment. ""We are conducting a comprehensive investigation to determine the factors that led to this crash,"" said Officer James Caldwell of the CHP. ""Our goal is to prevent similar incidents in the future.""

Residents and local officials have praised the quick response and professionalism of the emergency services involved. ""We're grateful for the swift action taken by our firefighters and police officers,"" said Manteca Mayor Ben Cantu. ""Their dedication and expertise undoubtedly saved lives today.""

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers present on highways and the importance of adhering to traffic regulations. It also highlights the crucial role of first responders in ensuring public safety and managing emergencies effectively.

As the investigation continues, authorities urge anyone with information regarding the crash to come forward and assist with the inquiry. Meanwhile, the community remains hopeful for the recovery of the individuals involved and extends its support to their families during this challenging time.",gpt
Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks,"In an unprecedented move that underscores the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, major sports leagues across the United States have either paused their seasons or decided to play games without fans in attendance. This dramatic shift comes as the country grapples with a surge in COVID-19 cases, prompting health officials to recommend restricting large gatherings to curb the virus's spread.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) was among the first to announce significant changes, with Commissioner Adam Silver confirming that the season would be suspended indefinitely. The decision came swiftly after a player tested positive for the virus, forcing the league to act decisively to protect players, staff, and fans. ""The health and safety of our players, teams, and fans remain our top priority,"" Silver stated in a press conference. ""We believe this is the most responsible course of action given the current circumstances.""

Following the NBA's lead, the National Hockey League (NHL) also announced a pause in its regular season. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman emphasized the importance of prioritizing public health, noting that while the decision was difficult, it was necessary. ""We understand the impact this has on our players, our fans, and everyone involved with our sport, but we must act in the best interest of community health and safety,"" Bettman said.

Meanwhile, Major League Baseball (MLB) has postponed the start of its season by at least two weeks. Spring training games have been canceled, leaving players and fans in limbo as the league assesses the evolving situation. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred expressed his understanding of the disappointment felt by fans but reiterated that the league's primary concern is the well-being of all involved. ""While we are eager to get back to playing baseball, we must be prudent and prioritize health above all else,"" Manfred remarked.

The National Football League (NFL) is currently in its off-season, but the league is closely monitoring developments and has already made adjustments to its upcoming draft, which will now be conducted without public events. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell assured fans that the league is prepared to make additional changes if necessary. ""We are committed to ensuring the safety of our players, staff, and fans, and we will continue to make informed decisions based on guidance from health experts,"" Goodell stated.

In the collegiate sports realm, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) made the groundbreaking decision to cancel its annual March Madness basketball tournament, a staple of American sports culture that generates significant revenue and viewership. NCAA President Mark Emmert acknowledged the disappointment this decision would cause but emphasized the overarching need to prioritize health and safety. ""Canceling the tournament is heartbreaking, but it is the right thing to do in these challenging times,"" Emmert said.

These sweeping changes reflect the broader impact of the coronavirus pandemic on American society, with sports being just one of many sectors facing unprecedented disruptions. The economic ramifications are significant, with teams, venues, and surrounding businesses all feeling the pinch from the absence of live sporting events. Analysts predict that the pause in sports could result in billions of dollars in lost revenue across the various leagues.

Fans, while understandably disappointed, have largely expressed support for the measures, recognizing the importance of prioritizing public health. Social media platforms have been flooded with messages of encouragement for players and teams, with many fans expressing optimism that the hiatus will ultimately help curb the spread of the virus.

Public health officials have praised the proactive steps taken by the leagues, noting that these decisions could serve as a model for other organizations grappling with similar challenges. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading expert on infectious diseases, commended the leagues for their actions, highlighting the importance of taking decisive steps to protect communities. ""The decision to halt play and limit gatherings is a crucial part of our efforts to contain the virus and protect public health,"" Fauci stated.

As the nation continues to navigate this public health crisis, the future of live sports remains uncertain. Leagues have assured fans that they are exploring all options to resume play safely, but for now, the focus remains on health and safety. This historic pause in American sports serves as a stark reminder of the pandemic's far-reaching impact and the collective responsibility to protect one another.",gpt
10 commandments for better sleep on World Sleep Day,"On World Sleep Day, experts and health enthusiasts alike are turning their attention to the vital role that sleep plays in overall well-being. Celebrated annually, this day is dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of good sleep habits and how they can significantly improve quality of life. In honor of this occasion, here are ten commandments for better sleep that can help transform your nights from restless to restful.

**1. Honor Your Sleep Schedule**

Consistency is key when it comes to sleep. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps regulate your body’s internal clock. This consistency can lead to better sleep quality and improved health. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, as recommended by sleep experts.

**2. Create a Restful Environment**

Your bedroom should be a sanctuary for sleep. Keep it cool, quiet, and dark to promote restful slumber. Consider blackout curtains, white noise machines, or earplugs if necessary. A comfortable mattress and pillows are essential investments for quality rest.

**3. Limit Exposure to Light Before Bed**

Exposure to light during the evening can interfere with the production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep. Avoid screens from televisions, computers, and smartphones at least an hour before bedtime. Instead, opt for reading a book or listening to calming music.

**4. Be Mindful of Your Diet**

What you eat and drink can have a significant impact on your sleep. Avoid heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime. While alcohol might make you feel drowsy initially, it can disrupt sleep later in the night. Opt for sleep-friendly snacks like a banana or a small bowl of whole-grain cereal if you need something before bed.

**5. Exercise Regularly**

Regular physical activity can promote faster and deeper sleep. However, timing is crucial. Try to finish any vigorous exercise at least a few hours before bedtime. Activities like yoga or stretching can be calming and are great to do in the evening.

**6. Manage Stress and Worries**

Stress and worries are major sleep disruptors. Develop a pre-sleep routine to unwind and manage stress levels. Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or jotting down your thoughts in a journal can help clear your mind and prepare you for sleep.

**7. Avoid Naps After Mid-afternoon**

While naps can be beneficial, especially if you’re sleep-deprived, they can also interfere with nighttime sleep if taken too late in the day. If you feel the need to nap, aim for a short 20-30 minute session before the afternoon ends.

**8. Establish a Pre-sleep Routine**

Creating a ritual before bed can signal your body that it’s time to wind down. This could include activities like taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing relaxation exercises. Consistently following a routine helps reinforce healthy sleep patterns.

**9. Use Your Bed for Sleep and Intimacy Only**

To strengthen the association between bed and sleep, it’s important to reserve the bed for sleeping and intimacy only. Avoid working, eating, or watching TV in bed. This helps train your brain to recognize that your bed is a place for relaxation and rest.

**10. Know When to See a Professional**

If you’ve tried various methods and still struggle with sleep, it may be time to consult a healthcare professional. Sleep disorders like insomnia or sleep apnea can have serious health consequences if left untreated. A sleep specialist can provide guidance and treatment options tailored to your needs.

On this World Sleep Day, take the opportunity to reflect on your sleep habits and consider adopting these commandments for better rest. Sleep is a fundamental pillar of health, and prioritizing it can lead to improved mood, greater productivity, and a healthier life. Remember, quality sleep is not a luxury, but a necessity.",gpt

The tragic details of the killing of Amie Harwick,"In a case that has drawn widespread attention and renewed conversations about domestic violence and mental health, the tragic death of Amie Harwick, a well-known family and sex therapist, has left a profound impact on both her community and the broader public. Harwick, 38, was found dead on February 15, 2020, beneath the third-story balcony of her Hollywood Hills home, a victim of what authorities have described as a violent attack.

Police were called to Harwick's residence in the early hours of the morning, responding to reports of a woman screaming. Upon arrival, officers discovered Harwick gravely injured on the ground beneath her balcony, having sustained significant injuries consistent with a fall. She was swiftly transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. The Los Angeles County coroner later confirmed that her death resulted from blunt force injuries to the head and torso, with evidence suggesting she had been strangled before the fall.

The investigation quickly focused on Gareth Pursehouse, Harwick's former boyfriend, who was arrested shortly after her death. Pursehouse, 41, was charged with murder and first-degree residential burglary with the special circumstance allegation of lying in wait, which could make him eligible for the death penalty if convicted.

Harwick had previously expressed fear of Pursehouse, having obtained multiple restraining orders against him. Friends and colleagues of Harwick described her as deeply concerned for her safety in the weeks leading up to her death. The restraining order against Pursehouse had expired just two weeks before the incident, raising critical questions about the effectiveness of such measures in preventing domestic violence.

Those close to Harwick remember her as a vibrant and dedicated professional, who was deeply committed to her career and her clients. She held a doctorate in human sexuality and was known for her work in family and sex therapy, often appearing on television and radio programs to discuss her expertise. Her tragic death has not only devastated those who knew her personally but has also left a void in the therapeutic community where she was held in high regard.

The case has sparked a broader conversation about the dangers of intimate partner violence and the legal system's role in protecting victims. Advocates have pointed to Harwick's death as a stark reminder of the potential for restraining orders to fall short, particularly when abusers are determined to cause harm. In the wake of the tragedy, there have been renewed calls for reforms to ensure that restraining orders are more than just pieces of paper, but rather effective tools for safeguarding those at risk.

The Los Angeles District Attorney's office, led by Jackie Lacey at the time, emphasized their commitment to seeking justice for Harwick. ""The murder of Amie Harwick is a devastating reminder of the lethal consequences of intimate partner violence,"" Lacey said in a statement. ""We are determined to hold accountable the individual responsible for this heinous act.""

As the legal proceedings against Pursehouse continue, Harwick's friends and family have channeled their grief into advocacy. They have established foundations and initiatives aimed at raising awareness about domestic violence and providing support for victims. Their efforts serve both as a tribute to Harwick's life and as a rallying cry for systemic change.

In a society grappling with the complexities of intimate relationships and the often invisible nature of domestic abuse, Amie Harwick's story is a poignant reminder of the urgent need for continued dialogue and action. Her death underscores the critical importance of addressing the root causes of such violence and ensuring that those at risk have access to the resources and protection they need.

As the community mourns the loss of a beloved therapist and advocate, there remains a collective hope that her legacy will inspire meaningful change and prevent future tragedies. Through the pain and sorrow, Harwick's indomitable spirit and dedication to helping others continue to resonate, lighting a path toward healing and justice.",gpt
The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"Residents of the bustling metropolis of Centerville have been scratching their heads over an unusual mystery this past month: the sudden disappearance of bus riders. What began as a few empty seats on morning commutes has escalated into entire buses running their routes nearly empty, throwing both regular passengers and city officials into a state of confusion.

Centerville's public transit system, renowned for its efficiency and reliability, has long been the lifeline of the city. With over 1.5 million residents relying on buses daily, the sharp decline in riders has raised alarms not only among passengers but also within the city's Department of Transportation (DoT). According to recent data released by the DoT, ridership has plummeted by nearly 40% over the last four weeks, a statistic that has left many questioning the cause behind this sudden shift.

Local bus driver Marcus Bell, a veteran of over two decades, shared his bewilderment. ""I've been driving the same route for years, and I've never seen anything like this. Buses that used to be standing room only are now more than half empty. It's like people just vanished overnight,"" he said, shaking his head.

Theories abound among Centerville's citizens, ranging from the plausible to the bizarre. Some attribute the decline to a recent surge in ride-sharing services and electric scooters, which have become increasingly popular as they offer a more personalized and flexible mode of transportation. Others speculate about the impact of remote working policies that remain in place post-pandemic, reducing the need for daily commutes.

However, not all explanations are rooted in modern conveniences. A rumor circulating on social media suggests a more sinister cause: an urban legend involving a ""phantom bus"" that supposedly appears at night, whisking unsuspecting passengers away to an unknown fate. While this theory is widely dismissed by rational minds, its persistent presence online has added an eerie layer to the mystery.

In response to the drop in ridership, the DoT has launched an investigation to determine the underlying causes. ""We are conducting a thorough analysis of travel patterns, and we are in discussions with community leaders and transportation experts to better understand the situation,"" said Emily Tran, the DoT's spokesperson. ""Our priority is to ensure that our public transit system meets the needs of all Centerville residents.""

The city has also begun engaging with local businesses and residents to gather insights and feedback. A series of town hall meetings have been scheduled, aiming to provide a platform for public discussion and to address the community's concerns directly.

""We want to hear from those affected,"" Tran emphasized. ""Whether it's a change in work habits, preference for alternative transportation, or something else entirely, we are committed to finding solutions.""

Meanwhile, economists warn of the broader implications of this trend. A decline in public transit usage could lead to increased traffic congestion, higher emissions, and economic strain on the city's transit infrastructure. Centerville's economy, heavily reliant on its efficient transportation network, could face significant challenges if the trend continues unchecked.

Local businesses, particularly those near bus stops and main transit lines, have already reported a decrease in foot traffic. ""Our lunch crowd used to be steady, made up mostly of commuters,"" said Sarah Kim, owner of a popular downtown café. ""Lately, it's been much quieter. It's affecting our bottom line.""

As Centerville grapples with this perplexing situation, the city council is considering incentives to encourage public transit use. Proposed measures include discounted fare programs, improved bus shelters, and enhanced real-time tracking technology to improve rider experiences.

While the mystery of the missing bus riders remains unsolved, one thing is clear: Centerville must adapt to a rapidly changing transportation landscape. Whether through embracing new technologies or understanding shifting commuter behaviors, the city faces a pivotal moment in redefining its public transit system.

For now, the empty seats on Centerville's buses serve as a silent reminder of the challenges ahead, as the city seeks to unravel the enigma and restore confidence in its once-thriving transit network.",gpt
David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact,"David Axelrod, the seasoned political strategist and former senior advisor to President Barack Obama, is no stranger to the rough and tumble of political discourse. However, even for someone well-versed in the cut and thrust of American politics, waking up as an ""alternative fact"" was an unexpected twist. In a world where truth is frequently contested, Axelrod's bemusement over becoming a subject of misinformation highlights the ongoing struggle against the proliferation of false narratives.

The incident unfolded when a satirical news website published a piece claiming that Axelrod had admitted to orchestrating a grand conspiracy during his tenure in the Obama administration. The article, clearly marked as satire, was quickly picked up and circulated by several conspiracy theory websites and social media influencers who presented it as genuine news. By the time Axelrod caught wind of the story, it had already reached thousands of people, with many taking the claim at face value.

""I woke up this morning as an alternative fact,"" Axelrod remarked during an impromptu interview with a major news outlet. ""It's surreal to see your name used in such a way, especially when it’s based on something completely fabricated."" He went on to express concern about the impact of such misinformation, emphasizing how easily falsehoods can gain traction in today's digital landscape.

The incident underscores a broader issue that has plagued both political figures and the general public in recent years: the rise of ""alternative facts"" and the challenge of combating misinformation. The term ""alternative facts"" rose to infamy in 2017 when it was used by a White House official to describe demonstrably false statements. Since then, it has come to symbolize the struggle between objective reality and distorted narratives.

Axelrod, who has spent decades shaping political narratives and advising Democratic candidates, is acutely aware of the power of storytelling. Yet, he laments how the democratization of information has been accompanied by a surge in misinformation. ""In the past, we had gatekeepers who helped filter out the noise,"" he explained. ""Now, anyone with a keyboard can create a narrative, and if it resonates with enough people, it becomes a part of the public discourse.""

The rapid spread of the false story about Axelrod serves as a case study in how misinformation can thrive in the digital age. With the decline of traditional media outlets and the rise of social media platforms, the barriers to publishing have all but disappeared. This has enabled satirical and fake news sites to flourish, often blurring the line between entertainment and deception.

Experts in media literacy and digital communication stress the importance of critical thinking and fact-checking as antidotes to the misinformation epidemic. ""We need to cultivate a more discerning public,"" said Dr. Emily Hart, a professor of media studies. ""People should be taught to question the validity of what they read and verify information through reliable sources.""

In response to the incident, Axelrod took to social media to clarify the situation, urging his followers and the broader public to verify claims before accepting them as truth. His message was met with a mix of support and skepticism, illustrating the polarized nature of contemporary political dialogue.

Despite the personal inconvenience, Axelrod is hopeful that his experience can serve as a cautionary tale. ""If waking up as an 'alternative fact' helps highlight the dangers of misinformation, then perhaps some good can come of it,"" he mused. ""It’s a reminder that we all need to be vigilant in seeking out the truth.""

As the dust settles on this bizarre episode, Axelrod remains committed to advocating for truth and integrity in public discourse. The incident has reinforced his belief in the necessity of a well-informed citizenry, capable of discerning fact from fiction. In an era where the line between reality and fabrication is increasingly blurred, Axelrod's experience is a stark reminder of the ongoing battle for truth in the digital age.",gpt
"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","As New York City continues to grapple with rising coronavirus cases, pressure is mounting on city officials to close the nation's largest public school system. With over one million students, the decision to halt in-person learning would not only impact families citywide but could also set a precedent for other major urban school systems across the country.

The surge in COVID-19 cases has reignited the debate over the safety of keeping schools open during a pandemic. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Schools Chancellor Meisha Porter have been resolute in their commitment to keeping schools open, citing the importance of in-person learning for educational equity and student well-being. However, as the city’s positivity rate edges closer to the 3% threshold set by the administration, the pressure from health officials, teachers' unions, and concerned parents is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

The United Federation of Teachers (UFT), representing the city’s educators, has been vocal about their concerns. UFT President Michael Mulgrew stated earlier this week, “Our educators are committed to their students, but they should not have to choose between their health and their jobs.” The union is advocating for a temporary return to remote learning until the city can ensure safer conditions in schools, such as improved ventilation and robust testing protocols.

Parents, too, are divided on the issue. While some support the move to close schools as a necessary precaution, others worry about the impact on their children’s education and mental health. “My son has already fallen behind due to last year’s closures. I’m worried he won’t be able to catch up if schools close again,” said Maria Lopez, a mother of two in the Bronx. Conversely, Lisa Chen, a Brooklyn parent, argued that “keeping schools open with rising cases is a gamble on our children’s health.”

Health experts are weighing in, with many advocating for a cautious approach. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has stressed the importance of assessing community transmission rates and school-specific outbreaks. “The decision to close schools should be based on data and science,” Fauci noted in a recent interview. “If the virus is spreading rapidly in the community and schools are contributing to that spread, closures may be necessary.”

Adding to the complexity is the logistical challenge of transitioning a massive school system to remote learning. Last year’s abrupt shift highlighted significant disparities in access to technology and internet connectivity, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority students. City officials have vowed to address these issues, but many parents and educators remain skeptical about the feasibility of an equitable remote learning experience.

Meanwhile, city businesses and the broader economy are anxiously watching the situation unfold. Many parents rely on schools not only for education but also for childcare, enabling them to work. A school shutdown could reverberate through the local economy, affecting everything from small businesses to major corporations.

As the city approaches the critical positivity rate threshold, Mayor de Blasio has called for patience and cooperation from all parties involved. “We are closely monitoring the data and consulting with health experts,” he said at a recent press conference. “Our priority is the safety and well-being of our students and staff.”

Governor Kathy Hochul has also weighed in, offering state support to the city’s decision-making process. “We are in constant communication with New York City officials and are ready to provide any resources necessary to ensure the safety of our children and educators,” she stated.

The coming days will be crucial as officials, educators, parents, and health experts continue to navigate the difficult choices ahead. For now, New York City’s public school system remains open, but the mounting pressure and rising cases suggest that a potential closure is looming on the horizon. The decision will not only affect the immediate future of New York City students but could also have lasting implications for school systems across the nation as they confront similar challenges.",gpt
Violence forces Haiti to cancel Carnival,"In a significant blow to one of the Caribbean's most vibrant cultural celebrations, the Haitian government has announced the cancellation of its annual Carnival festivities amid escalating violence across the nation. The decision, announced on Friday, comes as gang-related violence and political instability continue to grip the country, posing a severe threat to public safety and order.

The Carnival, traditionally held in February, is one of Haiti's most anticipated events, drawing thousands of locals and tourists alike to the streets of Port-au-Prince and other major cities to revel in lively parades, music, and dance. This year's cancellation marks a sobering moment for a nation already reeling from a series of crises, including political turmoil, economic hardship, and the aftermath of devastating natural disasters.

Prime Minister Ariel Henry, addressing the nation in a televised statement, expressed his deep regret over the decision but emphasized the necessity of prioritizing public safety. ""Our beloved Carnival is a symbol of joy and resilience, but in the face of increasing violence, ensuring the security of our citizens must come first,"" he stated.

The cancellation follows a surge in violence attributed to armed gangs, who have gained significant control over large swaths of the capital and other regions. The gangs have been involved in kidnappings, extortion, and violent clashes, severely disrupting daily life and creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

The decision to cancel the Carnival has been met with disappointment and frustration from many Haitians, for whom the event represents not only a cultural highlight but also an economic boon. Local businesses, artists, and vendors rely heavily on the influx of visitors during the Carnival season to boost their incomes. The cancellation is expected to have a substantial economic impact, particularly on those who depend on the festivities for their livelihood.

Local artist and musician Jean-Louis Toussaint expressed his dismay, saying, ""Carnival is a time when we come together to celebrate our culture and heritage. It's heartbreaking that we have to cancel because of the violence. It feels like we're losing a part of ourselves.""

Tourism officials have also voiced concerns about the long-term implications for Haiti's tourism industry, which has struggled to recover from a litany of challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing political instability. The cancellation of such a high-profile event further dampens prospects for revitalizing the sector.

International observers and human rights organizations have repeatedly raised alarms about the deteriorating security situation in Haiti. The United Nations has been urging the international community to provide support to bolster security efforts and address the root causes of the violence.

In recent months, the Haitian government has faced increasing pressure to restore order and stability. However, efforts to curb gang activities have been hampered by limited resources and the complex political landscape. The assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021 further plunged the nation into chaos, leaving a power vacuum and exacerbating tensions.

The cancellation of the Carnival also underscores the broader challenges facing Haiti as it seeks to navigate a path toward stability and development. The event, with its rich history and cultural significance, has often served as a unifying force for the Haitian people, offering a momentary respite from the struggles of daily life.

As the nation comes to terms with this year's cancellation, there is a growing call for concerted efforts to address the underlying issues contributing to the violence. Civil society groups and community leaders are advocating for dialogue and collaboration to forge sustainable solutions that prioritize the needs and safety of the Haitian people.

While the Carnival has been postponed indefinitely, hopes remain high that the event will return in the future, stronger and more vibrant than ever. For now, however, the focus remains on navigating the current crisis and working toward a more secure and prosperous Haiti.

The international community continues to watch closely, with the hope that renewed efforts will help restore calm and allow the Haitian people to once again celebrate their rich cultural heritage in peace.",gpt
McDonald's is selling a new Big Mac with four patties,"In a bold move that is sure to excite fast-food enthusiasts and McDonald's aficionados alike, the global fast-food giant has announced the launch of a new iteration of its iconic Big Mac—this time featuring four beef patties. Dubbed the ""Mega Mac,"" this towering creation is set to hit restaurants across select markets from next week, prompting a wave of anticipation among burger lovers.

McDonald's, known for its innovative twists on classic menu items, has been experimenting with various burger configurations in response to growing consumer demand for more indulgent options. The Mega Mac represents the latest in a series of limited-time offerings designed to test the waters and attract both loyal customers and curious newcomers.

The decision to introduce the Mega Mac follows a successful trial run in Japan, where the four-patty burger reportedly sold out in several locations, prompting a wave of social media excitement and burger selfies. Building on this success, McDonald's aims to capitalize on the growing trend of oversized and novelty food items that have gained popularity on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.

The Mega Mac retains the classic elements that have made the Big Mac a favorite since its introduction in 1967—two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions on a sesame seed bun—but doubles the beef content. The additional patties are expected to satisfy those with larger appetites and appeal to the ever-present desire for more substantial, value-driven meals.

In a statement, McDonald's Chief Marketing Officer Morgan Flatley expressed enthusiasm about the new offering. ""The Big Mac has been a beloved staple for decades, and the Mega Mac is our way of celebrating that legacy by giving our customers even more of what they love,"" Flatley said. ""We've listened to feedback and understand that our customers are looking for bigger, bolder flavors. The Mega Mac delivers on that promise and then some.""

While the Mega Mac is set to debut in select locations initially, the company has not ruled out a broader rollout should the burger prove a hit with consumers. The launch will be supported by a robust marketing campaign across digital and traditional media, aiming to capture the attention of both loyal patrons and curious newcomers eager to try the latest McDonald's innovation.

However, the introduction of the Mega Mac has not come without its share of controversy. Health advocates and nutritionists have expressed concerns about the potential impact of such large portion sizes on public health, especially amid rising obesity rates. A standard Big Mac already contains 550 calories, and the Mega Mac is expected to far exceed that, raising questions about the balance between indulgence and health.

In response to these concerns, McDonald's has emphasized its commitment to providing a range of menu options to suit different dietary preferences and needs. ""We understand the importance of offering choices,"" Flatley noted. ""Our menu includes a variety of options, from salads and wraps to indulgent burgers like the Mega Mac. We believe in empowering our customers to make the choices that are right for them.""

As the Mega Mac prepares to make its debut, customers are already expressing their excitement on social media. Hashtags like #MegaMacChallenge and #BigMacLovers are trending, with users sharing their anticipation to try the towering burger. Some even speculate about how the Mega Mac could become a new fast-food challenge, similar to other eating feats that have captured the public's imagination.

Whether the Mega Mac will become a permanent fixture on the McDonald's menu remains to be seen. For now, it stands as a testament to the brand's willingness to experiment and adapt to the ever-changing tastes of its customers. As the burger world braces for the arrival of this beefy behemoth, one thing is clear: the Mega Mac is set to make a big splash in the fast-food scene.",gpt
BBC News,"**BBC News: Navigating the Challenges of Modern Broadcasting**

In an era marked by rapid technological advancement and shifting viewer habits, the BBC continues to stand as a stalwart of journalism, navigating the complexities of modern broadcasting while maintaining its commitment to public service. Founded in 1922, the British Broadcasting Corporation has evolved from a radio service into a global multimedia entity, yet the challenges it faces today are perhaps more significant than ever before.

As the digital age revolutionizes the way audiences consume news, the BBC finds itself at a crossroads. The rise of streaming services, social media, and on-demand content has fragmented audiences, forcing traditional broadcasters to rethink their strategies. In response, the BBC has embarked on a digital transformation journey, seeking to deliver content that is not only informative but also engaging and accessible across various platforms.

One of the major challenges the BBC grapples with is funding. As a public broadcaster, it is primarily financed through the television license fee, a model that has come under scrutiny in recent years. Critics argue that the fee is outdated in an age where television sets are no longer the primary medium for content consumption. In response, the corporation has explored alternative funding models, sparking debates about its independence and the potential influence of commercial interests.

Amidst these debates, the BBC's mission to provide impartial news remains a cornerstone of its operations. In an increasingly polarized world, the demand for unbiased reporting is more crucial than ever. However, achieving this ideal is no small feat. The corporation faces the delicate task of balancing diverse perspectives while ensuring its coverage is fair and representative. This challenge is compounded by the proliferation of misinformation and the pressures of operating in a highly competitive media landscape.

To address these issues, the BBC has invested in technology and innovation. The introduction of AI-driven tools for content delivery and audience analysis has enabled more personalized and relevant content experiences. Additionally, the corporation's commitment to transparency and accountability is evident in its efforts to fact-check and verify information rigorously, bolstering trust among its global audience.

The BBC's role in international broadcasting also remains pivotal. With services in over 40 languages, it reaches an audience of more than 400 million people worldwide. This global reach positions the BBC as a key player in promoting cultural understanding and offering a platform for diverse voices. However, operating in multiple geopolitical contexts presents its own set of challenges, with the corporation often navigating complex diplomatic landscapes to ensure its correspondents' safety and editorial freedom.

Domestically, the BBC plays a significant role in the cultural and educational fabric of the UK. Its programming spans a wide spectrum, from news and documentaries to entertainment and children's shows. This diverse portfolio not only caters to different tastes and demographics but also fulfills its public service remit. Yet, with the competition from commercial broadcasters and digital platforms intensifying, maintaining its relevance and appeal to younger audiences is a challenge the BBC is actively addressing.

In recent years, the BBC has launched several initiatives aimed at engaging younger viewers and listeners. The expansion of its online services, including BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds, reflects a strategic shift towards digital-first content delivery. These platforms offer a vast library of content that can be accessed anytime, anywhere, catering to the on-demand preferences of modern audiences.

As the BBC strides into its second century, it remains an institution synonymous with quality journalism and cultural enrichment. Its ability to adapt and innovate while staying true to its core values will determine its success in the years to come. In a world where information is abundant yet trust is scarce, the BBC’s role as a reliable source of news and entertainment is more important than ever. The corporation's ongoing efforts to evolve and meet contemporary challenges head-on ensure that it continues to be a vital part of the global media landscape.",gpt
Transcripts,"In a significant development that has captured national attention, the release of transcripts from a series of high-profile meetings has stirred a hornet's nest of political and public debate. The transcripts, unveiled late yesterday, provide a rare and unfiltered glimpse into the inner workings of government and corporate dialogues, sparking discussions about transparency, accountability, and the potential repercussions of such revelations.

The transcripts, reportedly comprising hundreds of pages, detail conversations that occurred over a span of several months between top government officials and major industry leaders. The topics discussed range from economic strategies to environmental policies and beyond. For many, the release of these documents is a watershed moment in the ongoing quest for transparency within both public and private sectors.

One of the most striking revelations from the transcripts is the candid nature of the discussions. In one exchange, a senior government official is heard expressing concerns about the pace of regulatory changes being pushed by industry representatives. ""We need to ensure that these changes benefit the public, not just corporate interests,"" the official is quoted as saying. This particular excerpt has already ignited a firestorm of reactions from advocacy groups who have long suspected that corporate interests wield undue influence over policy-making processes.

Environmental groups, in particular, have seized upon the transcripts as evidence of what they describe as ""backroom dealing"" that undermines public welfare. ""These transcripts confirm our worst fears,"" said Emily Carter, spokesperson for Green Earth, a prominent environmental advocacy organization. ""The cavalier attitude towards environmental regulations and the prioritization of profit over planet is deeply troubling.""

However, industry leaders have been quick to defend their positions, arguing that their input is essential for crafting policies that are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable. ""It's easy to vilify corporations, but the reality is that we bring valuable expertise to the table,"" said Mark Thompson, CEO of a leading energy firm. ""We have a shared interest in ensuring a balanced approach that serves everyone.""

The political ramifications of the transcript release are also beginning to unfold. Opposition parties have pounced on the opportunity to criticize the current administration, accusing it of being too cozy with corporate giants at the expense of ordinary citizens. ""This is a clear indication of a government that is more interested in serving the elite than addressing the needs of its people,"" said Susan Ramirez, a leading opposition figure. ""Transparency and accountability must be prioritized moving forward.""

In contrast, supporters of the administration argue that the transcripts demonstrate a commitment to open dialogue with all stakeholders, which is crucial for effective governance. ""Engaging with industry leaders is not only necessary but also beneficial,"" said James O’Connor, a spokesperson for the ruling party. ""These discussions are part and parcel of a functioning democracy.""

Legal experts are now weighing in on the implications of the transcript release, particularly concerning issues of confidentiality and the potential impact on future negotiations. ""The release raises important questions about the balance between transparency and the need for discretion in sensitive discussions,"" noted Dr. Linda Foster, a professor of law at Columbia University. ""While transparency is vital, there is also a risk that such disclosures could inhibit frank conversations in the future.""

As the debate continues to unfold, calls for systemic changes in how such meetings are conducted and documented are growing louder. Advocacy groups are demanding more stringent regulations to ensure that all stakeholders, including the public, have a voice in critical decisions that affect their lives.

Meanwhile, the public response has been mixed, with some citizens expressing outrage, while others see the release as a positive step towards greater accountability. Social media platforms are abuzz with discussions, as hashtags related to the transcripts trend globally.

In the coming weeks, it is expected that the fallout from these revelations will continue to dominate headlines, as various parties jockey for position and the public digests the contents of the transcripts.

Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"The debate over allowing cell phone calls on airplane flights is once again making headlines, as technological advancements and regulatory shifts pave the way for potential changes in how we communicate at 35,000 feet. While airlines and passengers alike weigh the pros and cons, the question remains: are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?

For years, inflight cell phone use has been a contentious issue, primarily due to concerns over interference with aircraft systems and the potential for cabin disruptions. However, recent developments in aviation technology have addressed many of these safety concerns. Modern aircraft are increasingly equipped with sophisticated systems that can safely manage signals from cell phones, effectively mitigating interference risks.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have historically imposed strict regulations on cell phone use during flights. However, both agencies have shown signs of reconsidering these restrictions. In recent years, the FCC has explored the possibility of allowing airlines to offer cell phone services, provided that the necessary technology is in place to prevent any impact on flight safety. Meanwhile, the FAA has focused more on ensuring that personal electronic devices do not pose a threat during critical phases of flight.

Several airlines have already begun experimenting with inflight communication services. European carriers, in particular, have led the charge, offering passengers the ability to make calls via Wi-Fi connections. These services operate by using onboard Wi-Fi systems to connect calls through satellite links, thus circumventing traditional cellular networks. As a result, passengers can make and receive calls without interfering with the aircraft's communication systems.

Despite the technological feasibility, the introduction of cell phone calls on flights raises questions about passenger comfort and cabin etiquette. Many travelers value the relative peace and quiet of airplane cabins, where they can disconnect from the outside world. The prospect of being subjected to fellow passengers' phone conversations during a flight is not appealing to everyone. This sentiment is reflected in surveys, where a significant number of respondents express opposition to allowing phone calls during flights, citing concerns about noise and privacy.

Airlines themselves are divided on the issue. Some see the potential for new revenue streams by offering inflight calling services, while others fear that allowing phone calls could exacerbate tensions among passengers. The challenge lies in balancing the potential benefits with the need to maintain a comfortable and harmonious cabin environment.

One potential compromise could involve designated sections or times for phone use, similar to quiet cars on trains. This approach could allow passengers who wish to make calls to do so without disturbing those who prefer a quieter experience. Additionally, airlines may explore implementing etiquette guidelines to minimize disruptions, such as limiting the duration of calls or encouraging the use of headphones.

The global landscape also plays a role in the inevitability of cell phone calls on flights. As more countries and airlines embrace the technology, pressure mounts for others to follow suit. International travelers accustomed to phone access on flights may begin to demand similar services on domestic routes. Moreover, as business travel rebounds, the demand for constant connectivity is likely to increase, further driving the push for inflight calling capabilities.

In conclusion, while the introduction of cell phone calls on airplane flights is not yet a foregone conclusion, the combination of technological advancements, regulatory reconsiderations, and evolving passenger expectations makes it a distinct possibility. As the debate continues, airlines will need to carefully consider how to implement these services in a way that respects both safety and passenger comfort. Whether or not cell phone calls become a standard feature of air travel, the conversation itself signals a significant shift in how we view communication in the skies.",gpt
"On Friday the 13th we wonder why, scientifically, we believe in superstitions","On a crisp autumn day, Friday the 13th looms with an air of foreboding for many. The date, notorious for its association with bad luck, often prompts a mix of apprehension and curiosity. But why do such superstitions persist in an age dominated by science and technology? The answer lies in a fascinating blend of psychology, history, and human nature.

Superstitions, by their very nature, are beliefs that defy logic. They are the proverbial black cats that cross our paths, the ladders we avoid walking under, and the mirrors we fear breaking. These beliefs are deeply embedded in human culture, transcending generations and geography. At their core, superstitions represent an attempt to understand and exert control over an unpredictable world.

Psychologists suggest that superstitions arise from a fundamental human desire to predict and control outcomes. This is particularly relevant in situations characterized by uncertainty or fear. Dr. Stuart Vyse, a psychologist and author of ""Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition,"" notes that superstitions offer a semblance of control in situations where individuals feel powerless. By adhering to certain rituals or avoiding specific actions, people believe they can influence the outcome of events.

The roots of Friday the 13th as an unlucky day trace back to several historical and cultural influences. The number 13 has long been considered unlucky in Western societies. This aversion is partly attributed to the last supper of Jesus Christ, where Judas Iscariot, the betrayer, was the 13th guest. Meanwhile, Fridays have been seen as unlucky since the crucifixion of Jesus is believed to have occurred on this day. The combination of these two elements—Friday and the number 13—fueled the superstition, creating a potent symbol of misfortune.

Moreover, the human brain is wired to recognize patterns, even when none exist. This cognitive bias, known as apophenia, leads individuals to link random events to a cause-and-effect relationship. For instance, if someone experiences a series of unfortunate events on Friday the 13th, they might attribute these occurrences to the date itself, reinforcing the superstition.

Interestingly, superstitions are not limited to negative beliefs. They also include positive rituals and charms believed to bring good fortune. Athletes, for example, are known for their adherence to specific routines or the wearing of ""lucky"" items during competitions. These rituals, while seemingly irrational, can enhance performance by boosting confidence and reducing anxiety. Psychologists refer to this phenomenon as the ""placebo effect of superstitions,"" where belief in a practice's efficacy can lead to real, positive outcomes.

Cultural transmission plays a significant role in the perpetuation of superstitions. As children, we absorb beliefs and behaviors from our environment, often adopting the superstitions of our parents or communities. These beliefs can become deeply ingrained, persisting into adulthood and even being passed on to subsequent generations.

Despite their persistence, superstitions face scrutiny in the light of scientific reasoning. The scientific method, with its emphasis on evidence and logic, challenges the validity of superstitions. Yet, even among scientists and skeptics, superstitions endure. This paradox highlights the complex interplay between rational thought and the more instinctive, emotional aspects of human cognition.

In recent years, the study of superstitions has gained traction in the field of behavioral science. Researchers explore the psychological benefits of superstitions, such as their potential to alleviate stress and foster a sense of community. In a world where uncertainty is a constant, these beliefs offer comfort and a sense of identity, underscoring the enduring appeal of the irrational.

As Friday the 13th arrives yet again, it serves as a reminder of the curious blend of logic and lore that defines human belief systems. While science continues to unravel the mysteries of the universe, superstitions offer a glimpse into the timeless human quest for meaning and control. Whether you choose to avoid sidewalk cracks or embrace the day with skepticism, the power of superstition remains an intriguing testament to the complexities of the human mind.",gpt
Zuckerberg's important message on miscarriage,"In an unprecedented and deeply personal revelation, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently opened up about the sensitive topic of miscarriage, aiming to shed light on an issue that affects millions yet is often shrouded in silence. Speaking candidly at a technology conference in San Francisco, Zuckerberg shared his own family’s experience with miscarriage, urging for a more open dialogue surrounding the subject.

Zuckerberg, who is known for his reserved public demeanor, took the stage to discuss not only the impact of technology on global communication but also to deliver an important message on the human aspect of these platforms. He highlighted how social media can play a crucial role in providing support and breaking the taboo around miscarriage.

Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have been open about their journey to parenthood. Before the birth of their daughters, Maxima and August, the couple faced several miscarriages. “When we first went through it, we felt so alone,” Zuckerberg admitted during his speech, his voice tinged with emotion. “But it’s a reality shared by many families. It’s something that should not be endured in silence.”

The tech magnate’s decision to speak on such a personal matter is part of a broader movement encouraging transparency and dialogue. With his platform, Zuckerberg aims to use social media as a tool to foster community support and understanding. “We have this incredible opportunity with social media to connect people and share experiences, even the painful ones,” he noted. “By talking about these experiences, we create a community that can offer comfort and guidance.”

Statistics underscore the prevalence of miscarriage, with estimates suggesting that as many as one in four pregnancies end this way. Despite its commonality, miscarriage remains a topic many find difficult to discuss openly. Zuckerberg is advocating for a shift in how society approaches this issue, suggesting that candid conversations can help demystify the process and reduce the stigma that often accompanies it.

The response to Zuckerberg’s message has been overwhelmingly positive, with many praising him for his vulnerability and leadership in addressing such a personal issue. Social media platforms saw an influx of users sharing their own experiences with miscarriage, highlighting the need for community and support. Many expressed gratitude for Zuckerberg’s willingness to use his influence to bring attention to a topic that has been quietly endured by countless families.

Mental health professionals have also commended Zuckerberg’s efforts, emphasizing the importance of support networks in the healing process. Dr. Sarah Williams, a psychologist specializing in grief counseling, noted, “When influential figures like Mark Zuckerberg speak openly about miscarriage, it helps normalize the conversation. This can encourage others to seek help and support, which is crucial for emotional healing.”

In addition to encouraging open dialogue, Zuckerberg has also pledged to further explore how technology can aid in supporting those affected by miscarriage. He expressed a commitment to developing tools that can connect individuals with resources and communities tailored to their experiences. “We’re looking at ways to enhance our platforms to better support people during these difficult times,” he said. “Our goal is to create safe spaces where individuals can share their stories and find the support they need.”

Zuckerberg’s initiative comes at a time when discussions about mental health and well-being are gaining momentum. By addressing miscarriage, he joins a growing list of public figures who are using their voices to challenge societal norms and encourage open conversations.

As Zuckerberg concluded his speech, he reiterated the power of community and the role that technology can play in fostering connections. “We’re all in this together,” he said. “By sharing our stories and supporting one another, we can create a world where no one has to suffer in silence.”

In a world where technology often feels impersonal, Zuckerberg’s message is a poignant reminder of the human connections that lie at the heart of these innovations. His call to action is not just for those who have experienced miscarriage but for everyone, encouraging a culture of empathy, support, and understanding. As more individuals and families feel empowered to share their experiences, the hope is that society will become more compassionate and inclusive, breaking down the barriers of silence and stigma that have persisted for far too long.",gpt
Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much in 'Big Time Adolescence',"In a film landscape often populated by ambitious narratives and complex character studies, ""Big Time Adolescence"" offers a slice of life that is thoroughly grounded in its simplicity. At its heart is Pete Davidson, the ""Saturday Night Live"" breakout star known for his unique brand of humor and candor. However, while Davidson brings his signature style to the film, his performance does not venture far from his comedic comfort zone, offering little more than what fans might expect from his established public persona.

""Big Time Adolescence,"" directed by Jason Orley in his feature debut, centers on the coming-of-age narrative of Mo, played by Griffin Gluck, a 16-year-old high school student navigating the turbulent waters of adolescence. The twist here is Mo's unlikely mentor and best friend, Zeke, portrayed by Davidson. Zeke is a charismatic college dropout who exudes a carefree demeanor, a character that feels tailor-made for Davidson’s laid-back comedic sensibility. The film’s story unfolds through Mo’s eyes, highlighting his journey influenced heavily by Zeke's unorthodox guidance.

Davidson’s portrayal of Zeke is undeniably entertaining; he effortlessly delivers the charm and humor that have become hallmarks of his career. However, Davidson's performance remains largely within the bounds of what audiences have come to expect from him on and off-screen. Zeke is a character whose depth is hinted at but never fully explored. The script provides moments where Davidson could delve deeper into the complexities of Zeke’s arrested development and the impact of his carefree lifestyle, yet these opportunities are not fully capitalized on. Instead, Davidson glides through the film with the same nonchalant ease that has defined much of his comedic work, presenting a character that, while amusing, lacks significant growth or transformation.

The film itself, while predictable in its narrative arc, succeeds in capturing the essence of its characters' experiences. Orley’s direction and script provide a humorous yet poignant exploration of adolescence, friendship, and the consequences of idolizing flawed figures. The dynamic between Mo and Zeke is at once endearing and troubling, a testament to Gluck’s nuanced performance. Gluck skillfully portrays Mo’s vulnerability and curiosity, making his character’s misguided admiration for Zeke both believable and relatable. It is this dynamic that propels the film forward, with Gluck serving as the emotional anchor.

Supporting performances from the likes of Jon Cryer, who plays Mo’s concerned father, and Emily Arlook, as Mo’s sister, add depth to the narrative, providing a necessary counterbalance to the antics of Zeke and Mo. They help ground the story in reality, reminding viewers of the implications of Zeke’s influence on Mo’s life.

Despite its relatively straightforward storyline, ""Big Time Adolescence"" manages to address pertinent themes with a light touch. It speaks to the universal experience of growing up, the allure of rebellion, and the sometimes misguided attempts to find oneself through the emulation of others. The film’s humor is often sharp, punctuated by moments of sincerity that prevent it from veering too far into the absurd.

While ""Big Time Adolescence"" offers an entertaining and relatable narrative, it remains a vehicle that does not demand much from its leading man. Davidson’s natural charisma carries the film, but those hoping to see a different side of the comedian may find themselves wanting. The film does not necessarily suffer from this lack of character development, but it does leave potential untapped. Davidson’s fans will likely appreciate his performance for its familiar wit and charm, but those unfamiliar with his work might wonder if there’s more depth to the actor than what is seen here.

In the end, ""Big Time Adolescence"" is a film that thrives on the chemistry between its leads and the authenticity of its portrayal of adolescent life. While Pete Davidson may not stretch his acting chops significantly, his presence adds a unique flavor to the film, making it an enjoyable watch for those seeking humor laced with a dose of reality. The film may not break new ground, but it succeeds in telling a story that is both engaging and reflective of the complexities of growing up, even if its lead remains firmly in his comedic wheelhouse.",gpt
"In Earth's early history, a day was 23.5 hours and a year lasted 372 days","In a fascinating glimpse into Earth's distant past, scientists have revealed that the planet once had shorter days and longer years. Recent research suggests that approximately 1.4 billion years ago, a day on Earth lasted only 23.5 hours, while a year stretched over 372 days. This discovery sheds light on the dynamic nature of our planet's rotation and its relationship with the Moon.

The study, conducted by a team of geophysicists and astronomers, highlights the intricate dance between Earth and its lunar companion. As the Moon gradually drifts away from Earth, its gravitational pull has been slowing Earth's rotation, leading to the lengthening of days. This process, known as tidal friction, is responsible for the incremental changes in the duration of Earth's days and the number of days in a year.

Researchers utilized sophisticated methods to arrive at these conclusions, including the analysis of ancient rock formations and the study of tidal patterns preserved in the geological record. By examining layers of sediment and fossilized remains, scientists were able to reconstruct Earth's rotational history with remarkable precision.

The findings underscore the significance of the Earth-Moon relationship in shaping our planet's temporal framework. As the Moon's gravitational influence creates tidal bulges on Earth, it dissipates energy, gradually altering the planet's spin. This dynamic has been ongoing for billions of years, subtly transforming the length of days and years over geological time scales.

The implications of this research extend beyond mere curiosity about Earth's past. Understanding the planet's rotational evolution is crucial for reconstructing the history of its climate, biological processes, and even the development of life itself. The changing length of days would have influenced everything from the behavior of early life forms to the patterns of weather and climate that shaped the environment in which they evolved.

Moreover, the insights gained from this study could enhance our understanding of other planets and moons in our solar system. By analyzing the rotational dynamics of other celestial bodies, scientists can infer details about their geological and atmospheric histories, offering potential glimpses into the conditions necessary for life elsewhere in the cosmos.

The research also highlights the interconnected nature of celestial bodies within our solar system. Earth's rotational changes are not isolated phenomena but are influenced by the gravitational interplay with other astronomical entities. This interconnectedness serves as a reminder of the complex forces at work in the universe, shaping the destiny of planets and moons alike.

While Earth's days have lengthened over billions of years, the current rate of change is imperceptibly slow to human observers. The length of a day increases by approximately 1.7 milliseconds per century, meaning that it will take millions of years for noticeable differences to accumulate. However, understanding these processes allows scientists to better predict long-term trends and their potential impacts on Earth's environment.

As we uncover more about Earth's ancient past, questions about the future arise. How will Earth's rotation continue to evolve? What effects will this have on our planet's climate and ecosystems? These are questions that scientists are eager to explore, as they hold the key to understanding the long-term sustainability of life on Earth.

This research serves as a reminder of the ever-changing nature of our planet and the forces that have shaped it over eons. By studying Earth's past, scientists gain valuable insights into its future, highlighting the importance of continued exploration and discovery in our quest to understand the cosmos and our place within it.

As the Moon continues its slow retreat, Earth's days will keep lengthening and the number of days in a year will keep dwindling. While these changes occur on a timescale far beyond human perception, they are a testament to the dynamic and evolving character of our planet, offering a window into the profound forces that govern the universe.",gpt
Coronavirus decisions creates big burden for college students,"As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, college students find themselves bearing a significant burden due to decisions made in response to the crisis. From shifting academic schedules to the complexities of remote learning, these decisions have reshaped the traditional college experience, leaving many students struggling to adapt.

For many students, the abrupt transition from in-person classes to online learning was one of the earliest challenges. Institutions across the globe, in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, swiftly moved to virtual platforms in the spring of 2020. While this decision was necessary for public health, it brought with it a host of new challenges. Students had to quickly acclimate to a new mode of learning, often with inadequate resources or support. Internet connectivity issues, lack of access to necessary technology, and the difficulty of engaging with coursework remotely have all contributed to a less than ideal educational experience for many.

Moreover, the impact of these decisions extends beyond academics. The shift to online learning has blurred the lines between home and school, creating a unique set of stressors. ""It’s hard to focus when you’re taking classes from your bedroom,"" says Maya Thompson, a sophomore at a major university. ""There’s no separation between where I study and where I relax, which makes it difficult to switch off and can be really exhausting.""

Financial strain is another significant burden faced by students. With many colleges and universities opting for remote learning, questions have arisen about the cost of tuition and fees. Students are often paying full price for what they feel is a diminished college experience. Additionally, the pandemic has led to widespread job losses, affecting students who rely on part-time work to finance their education. This financial instability has forced some students to make difficult decisions about continuing their education or taking a pause.

Mental health has also emerged as a critical concern. The isolation and uncertainty brought about by the pandemic have exacerbated stress and anxiety among students. A survey conducted by the American College Health Association found that nearly 60% of college students reported that the pandemic has made it more difficult to access mental health services. Institutions are working to address these needs, but the demand often outstrips the available resources.

For international students, the challenges are even more pronounced. Travel restrictions and visa issues have left many in limbo, unsure if they will be able to return to campus or continue their studies. ""I’m stuck in my home country and attending classes at odd hours due to the time difference,"" says Raj Patel, an international student from India. ""It’s difficult to keep up, and I feel disconnected from my peers and professors.""

Despite these challenges, many students are finding ways to adapt and persevere. Student organizations have shifted to virtual platforms, offering a sense of community and support. Colleges are also working to provide more comprehensive resources, from improving digital infrastructure to expanding mental health services. ""We’re doing our best to support our students through these unprecedented times,"" says Dr. Lisa Garcia, dean of students at a large public university. ""We’re listening to their feedback and trying to adapt our approaches to meet their needs.""

As the world continues to navigate the complexities of the pandemic, students are calling for a greater understanding and flexibility from educational institutions. They hope that the lessons learned during this period will lead to more resilient and adaptable educational systems in the future.

The burden of the coronavirus pandemic on college students is undeniable, but it has also highlighted the need for innovation and change within higher education. As students, educators, and institutions work together to overcome these challenges, there is hope that the future of education will be more inclusive and accessible for all.",gpt

Why women feel pressured to shave,"In today's society, the pressure for women to maintain smooth, hairless skin is ubiquitous, perpetuated by cultural norms, media portrayals, and social expectations. From advertisements showcasing models with flawless skin to social media influencers endorsing hair removal products, the message is clear: hairlessness is synonymous with femininity and beauty. This expectation has roots tracing back centuries, but it continues to exert a powerful influence on women's grooming habits today.

Historically, the ideal of hairless skin can be linked to various societal and cultural influences. In Ancient Egypt and Rome, hair removal was practiced by both men and women, symbolizing cleanliness and class. However, the modern association between femininity and hairlessness gained momentum in the early 20th century, as sleeveless dresses became fashionable and the razor industry seized the opportunity to market products specifically to women. Gillette's 1915 Milady Décolleté razor campaign marked one of the first instances of a razor being marketed to women, emphasizing the removal of ""objectionable hair.""

Fast forward to the present, and the pressure has only intensified with the advent of digital media. Television, movies, and social media platforms portray hairless bodies as the standard of beauty, reinforcing the idea that body hair is undesirable. This portrayal often leaves women feeling compelled to conform to these ideals, fearing judgment or social stigma if they deviate from the norm.

In a 2020 survey conducted by the International Journal of Women's Dermatology, 84% of women reported regularly removing their body hair, with the primary motivation being societal pressure. Many women expressed feeling that not shaving would lead to negative perceptions, impacting their self-esteem and how they are viewed by others. This sentiment is echoed by Dr. Karla Mantilla, a gender studies expert, who states, ""The pressure to shave is deeply embedded in our culture, and it can significantly impact women's self-image and confidence.""

Despite these pressures, a growing number of women are challenging the status quo, embracing their natural body hair and advocating for body positivity. The body positivity movement, which encourages individuals to accept and appreciate their bodies as they are, has gained traction in recent years. Social media platforms have become a battleground for this cultural shift, with hashtags like #BodyHairDontCare and #Januhairy gaining popularity.

Prominent figures, such as actress Emma Corrin and musician Miley Cyrus, have openly embraced their body hair, challenging the traditional norms and encouraging others to do the same. These public endorsements have sparked conversations about the arbitrary nature of beauty standards and the importance of personal choice.

However, the decision to embrace body hair is not without its challenges. Women who choose not to shave may face backlash or criticism, both online and offline. This societal resistance highlights the ingrained nature of these beauty standards and the discomfort many feel when confronted with defiance of the norm.

For many women, the decision to shave or not is complicated by personal preferences, comfort, and individual experiences. Some women report feeling more confident and comfortable when they shave, appreciating the smoothness and perceived cleanliness. Others, however, find liberation in rejecting the razor, celebrating their natural state and the time and money saved from frequent hair removal.

The economic aspect of hair removal is not insignificant. The beauty industry profits immensely from products and services related to hair removal, with the global market for such products estimated to reach $3.4 billion by 2025. This financial burden falls disproportionately on women, who are often expected to invest in multiple hair removal methods, from razors and waxing to more permanent solutions like laser hair removal.

Ultimately, the decision to shave or not should be a personal one, free from societal pressures and expectations. While cultural norms continue to shape perceptions of beauty, there is a growing call for acceptance of diverse expressions of femininity. As the conversation around body hair continues to evolve, it is essential to remember that beauty is subjective, and confidence comes from embracing one's choices, whatever they may be.

In a world where women are constantly bombarded with messages about how they should look, the simple act of choosing whether or not to shave becomes a statement of autonomy and self-determination. As society progresses, the hope is that women can make this choice free from judgment, embracing their bodies in whichever way they choose.",gpt
Broadway theaters to suspend all performances because of coronavirus,"In an unprecedented move, Broadway theaters have decided to suspend all performances indefinitely as the coronavirus pandemic continues to escalate. The decision, announced on Thursday, reflects concerns for public health and safety amid the growing number of COVID-19 cases across the United States.

The Broadway League, the trade association for the Broadway industry, made the announcement following consultations with the New York City Department of Health and other stakeholders. The suspension is set to take effect immediately, with no specific timeline for when performances might resume.

Charlotte St. Martin, President of the Broadway League, expressed the industry's regret but emphasized the necessity of the action. “Our top priority has always been the health and well-being of our theatergoers and employees,” St. Martin said in a statement. “While we are heartbroken to close our doors temporarily, we are taking this step to help contain the spread of the virus.”

The decision comes as New York City, a cultural hub and one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, grapples with an increasing number of coronavirus infections. Public health officials have been urging social distancing measures to curb the virus's spread, leading to the cancellation of large gatherings and events across the city.

For Broadway, the heart of New York’s theater district, the suspension marks a significant economic blow. The industry, which generates an estimated $1.8 billion annually and supports nearly 97,000 jobs, will face substantial financial repercussions. Theaters, producers, actors, and all those involved in the production process are expected to feel the impact.

“We are living in an extraordinary time, and it requires extraordinary measures,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the Broadway League. “We look forward to welcoming audiences back to our theaters as soon as it is safe to do so.”

Many productions have been holding emergency meetings to address the fallout. Theaters are offering refunds or exchanges for ticket holders affected by the cancellations, and some productions are exploring digital options to reach audiences during the closure.

The abrupt halt affects both long-running hits and new productions. Major shows like ""Hamilton,"" ""The Lion King,"" and ""Wicked"" have all shuttered their doors, while new productions that were in previews or about to open now face an uncertain future. Shows like ""Six,"" which was scheduled to open on March 12, and ""Company,"" set for March 22, have postponed their premieres.

Broadway is not alone in its response to the coronavirus crisis. Other cultural institutions in New York City, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Carnegie Hall, have also announced closures. Across the country and around the world, similar measures are being taken as governments and organizations work to limit the spread of the virus.

While the closure of Broadway theaters is a devastating development for the industry, many are optimistic about the eventual recovery. Theater professionals are hopeful that, once the threat of the virus subsides, audiences will return in droves to support the beloved cultural institution.

In the meantime, the Broadway community is rallying to support one another. Actors, stagehands, and other workers affected by the shutdown are being encouraged to apply for assistance through various industry funds and programs. The Actors Fund, a national human services organization, is offering support to those in need during this challenging time.

The Broadway shutdown is a stark reminder of the broad-reaching impact of the coronavirus pandemic. As the world continues to grapple with this public health crisis, the resilience and solidarity of the arts community stand out as a beacon of hope.

As of now, there is no confirmed date for when performances will resume, but industry leaders are monitoring the situation closely. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available and as health officials provide guidance on when it may be safe to reopen theaters.

For now, the streets of Manhattan's theater district will be quieter than usual, as the iconic marquees go dark, waiting for the day when they can once again light up the night and welcome audiences back to the magic of Broadway.",gpt
Thousands forced to work on Brazil's cattle ranches,"In a disturbing revelation, thousands of individuals in Brazil have reportedly been coerced into working on cattle ranches under conditions that human rights organizations are now calling ""modern-day slavery."" This alarming situation has emerged in the vast and remote regions of the Amazon, where the sprawling cattle industry continues to expand, often at the expense of both human dignity and environmental sustainability.

According to data from Brazil’s Ministry of Labor, over 4,000 workers have been rescued from such conditions across the country in the past year alone, with a significant proportion of these cases linked to the cattle ranching sector. These workers, often lured by the promise of stable employment and decent wages, find themselves caught in a web of exploitation, isolated from their communities, and stripped of their basic rights.

The modus operandi of these ranches typically involves deceptive recruitment practices. Workers are often transported to remote locations and confronted with harsh working conditions, including excessive hours, inadequate food, and unsafe accommodations. Their identification documents are frequently confiscated, rendering them unable to leave and seek help. This form of entrapment has left many with no choice but to endure the abuse to survive.

""These are appalling violations of human rights that must be addressed urgently,"" stated Carla Bezerra, a spokesperson for Human Rights Watch in Brazil. ""The cattle industry in the Amazon is not only a driver of deforestation but also a hotbed for labor exploitation. The Brazilian government must take stronger action to enforce labor laws and protect these vulnerable workers.""

The cattle industry is a significant economic force in Brazil, which is the world's largest exporter of beef. However, this powerhouse sector has come under increasing scrutiny for its environmental impact, particularly its role in deforestation. The illegal clearing of land for pasture is a major contributor to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, a vital carbon sink and biodiversity hotspot.

In light of these revelations, international pressure is mounting on both the Brazilian government and global companies that source beef from the region. Major retailers and food companies are being urged to ensure that their supply chains are free from forced labor and environmental degradation. Several have pledged to implement stricter oversight and transparency measures, but activists argue that these efforts are not enough.

""The global demand for beef is fueling a cycle of exploitation and environmental destruction,"" said Mario Santos, an environmental activist with the Amazon Watch group. ""Consumers need to be aware of the hidden costs behind the meat on their plates and demand accountability from both corporations and governments.""

In response to the growing outcry, Brazilian authorities have increased inspections and raids on suspected ranches. In a recent operation, labor inspectors, accompanied by federal police, rescued 43 workers from a ranch in Pará state, where they were found living in squalid conditions without access to clean water or medical care.

Despite these efforts, experts warn that the sheer size and remoteness of the Amazon region make it challenging to monitor and regulate the cattle industry effectively. They stress the need for comprehensive policy reforms, including better coordination between federal and state agencies, enhanced protection for whistleblowers, and more resources for enforcement.

For the rescued workers, the road to recovery is often fraught with difficulties. Many return to their communities only to face limited job opportunities and the stigma associated with their experiences. Non-governmental organizations are stepping in to provide support, offering vocational training programs and legal assistance to help them rebuild their lives.

As the world grapples with the climate crisis and the pursuit of sustainable development, the situation in Brazil underscores the interconnectedness of human rights and environmental issues. The plight of these workers serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for systemic change in industries that profit at the expense of people and the planet.

The Brazilian government has acknowledged the problem and expressed commitment to addressing it. However, the challenge remains immense, requiring coordinated action from all sectors of society. As Brazil navigates this complex landscape, the question remains: will it be able to balance economic growth with the protection of its people and environment?",gpt

Step into the world of America's most notorious gangster,"In the dimly lit backstreets of early 20th-century America, where prohibition laws fueled clandestine enterprises and underground networks, one name resonated with both fear and admiration: Al Capone. As the most notorious gangster of his time, Capone’s legacy is a blend of ruthless ambition, extravagant living, and a reign that left an indelible mark on American history.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1899 to Italian immigrant parents, Alphonse Gabriel Capone was thrust into a world where poverty and opportunity coexisted. The streets of New York City, bustling with immigrants eager for a slice of the American dream, were the perfect breeding ground for organized crime. It was here that Capone first cut his teeth in the world of crime, under the mentorship of crime bosses Johnny Torrio and Frankie Yale.

By the age of 26, Capone relocated to Chicago, a city ripe with opportunity amidst the backdrop of prohibition. It was here that his criminal empire would flourish. Taking the reins from Torrio after an assassination attempt, Capone transformed Chicago’s underworld into a sophisticated operation, making vast fortunes through bootlegging, gambling, and prostitution.

Capone’s operations were as ruthless as they were lucrative. His control over the Chicago Outfit was maintained through a combination of strategic alliances and brutal enforcement. The infamous St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929, where seven members of a rival gang were gunned down, is often cited as a testament to Capone’s willingness to eliminate any threats to his empire. This act of violence cemented his reputation as a formidable figure in organized crime.

Yet, Capone was more than just a gangster; he was a master of public relations. Despite his criminal activities, he cultivated an image of a benevolent benefactor. He was often seen in public, generously donating to charities and opening soup kitchens during the Great Depression. This duality—ruthless mobster and charitable citizen—added complexity to his public persona, capturing the fascination of the American public.

The federal government, however, was less enamored. Determined to bring him to justice, U.S. authorities, led by prohibition agent Eliot Ness and his team of ""Untouchables,"" pursued Capone with relentless vigor. It was not the violent crimes but rather tax evasion that ultimately led to his downfall. In 1931, Capone was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison, a significant victory for law enforcement.

While incarcerated, first in Atlanta and later at the infamous Alcatraz, Capone’s health deteriorated, exacerbated by syphilis he had contracted years earlier. By the time of his release in 1939, his once-formidable empire had crumbled, and he retreated to a quiet life in Palm Island, Florida, where he died in 1947 at the age of 48.

Capone’s life has been immortalized in countless books, films, and television series, painting him as both villain and anti-hero. His story is a stark reminder of an era when the lines between law and crime were blurred, and the American dream could be pursued through both legitimate and illicit means.

Today, visitors to Chicago can explore the remnants of Capone’s reign. From the Lexington Hotel, where he reportedly had a secret vault, to the streets of Cicero, which served as his operational base, the city bears the scars and stories of its most infamous resident. Museums and guided tours offer a glimpse into the world of speakeasies, mobsters, and the relentless pursuit of fortune.

Al Capone remains a fascinating figure in American folklore—a symbol of the excesses of the roaring twenties and the harsh realities of organized crime. His story is a testament to the allure of power and the inevitable consequences of living outside the law. As America continues to grapple with issues of crime and justice, Capone’s legacy serves as both a cautionary tale and a compelling chapter in the nation’s history.",gpt
Meet the New Drive-Through: A Coronavirus Clinic Serving Up Swabs,"In a quiet suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, a new type of drive-through service has emerged, reflecting the adaptability and resilience of healthcare systems in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Known as the ""Drive-Through Swab Clinic,"" it offers a novel approach to community health by providing a convenient, efficient, and safe way for individuals to get tested for the coronavirus without leaving their vehicles.

The Drive-Through Swab Clinic operates in the parking lot of a repurposed high school, now transformed into a bustling center of medical activity. From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., cars line up in orderly rows, snaking through the outlined lanes, as healthcare workers in full protective gear attend to the occupants one by one. The process is seamless: patients register online, drive to the site, confirm their identity, and receive a nasal swab—all within the comfort of their own car. The entire procedure takes less than ten minutes, minimizing both wait times and potential exposure.

The concept of drive-through testing is not entirely new, but its implementation here is a testament to the innovation spurred by the pandemic. Dr. Lisa Carter, the medical director overseeing the clinic, explains, ""We wanted to create an environment where people could feel safe and maintain social distancing while getting tested. The drive-through model allows us to do just that, and it has been incredibly effective.""

Indeed, the efficiency of the drive-through clinic is matched by its accessibility. Located in a diverse neighborhood, the clinic serves a wide demographic, including those who may face barriers to healthcare access. ""We see everyone here—young families, elderly couples, essential workers on their lunch breaks,"" says nurse practitioner Jonathan Kim, who has been volunteering at the site since its inception. ""It's important for us to be accessible to all parts of the community, especially those who might have difficulty accessing traditional healthcare services.""

The clinic’s success is not just measured in the number of tests conducted—over 500 a day—but also in the peace of mind it provides to those who visit. For many, the drive-through offers a convenient solution amidst the uncertainties of the pandemic. Emily Rodriguez, a local teacher, shares her experience, ""As someone who works in a school, I need to get tested regularly. Being able to do that quickly and safely without worrying about exposure is a huge relief.""

The clinic is also a testament to community collaboration. Local government officials, healthcare providers, and volunteers have come together to make the operation possible. ""This is truly a community effort,"" says Mayor Tom Jenkins, who was instrumental in setting up the site. ""We’ve had overwhelming support from local businesses donating supplies and volunteers offering their time. It shows what we can achieve when we come together for a common cause.""

The Drive-Through Swab Clinic has also adapted to meet evolving needs. Recently, it began offering rapid antigen tests, which provide results within 15 minutes, in addition to the standard PCR tests. As Dr. Carter notes, ""Our goal is to stay responsive to the needs of the community and provide the most up-to-date testing options available.""

Looking ahead, the clinic plans to continue operations as long as there is demand for testing. However, there is hope that its success might inspire similar initiatives elsewhere. ""We believe this model of healthcare delivery can be replicated in other cities and communities,"" Dr. Carter suggests. ""It’s a practical solution that brings healthcare directly to the people who need it.""

As the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Drive-Through Swab Clinic stands as a beacon of ingenuity and hope. By transforming a mundane parking lot into a vital healthcare hub, it serves as a reminder of the power of innovation and community spirit in overcoming adversity.",gpt
A new use for McDonald's used cooking oil: 3D printing,"In an innovative leap towards sustainability, McDonald's is exploring a groundbreaking new use for its used cooking oil: 3D printing. This initiative, which is still in its experimental phase, promises to repurpose the vast quantities of oil used in its global chain of restaurants, potentially transforming the fast-food giant's environmental impact.

The fast-food industry has long been criticized for its contribution to environmental degradation, and McDonald's, as one of the largest players, often finds itself in the spotlight. However, this new venture could mark a significant shift in its approach to sustainability.

The resin is reportedly suitable for printing a wide range of products, from simple household items to complex industrial components.

""Converting used cooking oil into 3D printing material is a novel approach,"" explained Dr. Alan Cheng, a materials scientist involved in the project. ""It's not just about recycling; it's about repurposing materials in a way that adds significant value.""

The environmental benefits of this initiative could be substantial. McDonald's uses millions of gallons of cooking oil annually, much of which ends up as waste. By redirecting this oil into the production of 3D printing materials, the company could drastically reduce its environmental footprint. Additionally, the use of bio-based resins in 3D printing offers a more sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics.

However, the project is not without its challenges. The conversion process is complex and requires significant refinement to ensure the quality and consistency of the 3D printing material. Moreover, scaling up the operation to handle the enormous volume of oil produced by McDonald's worldwide is a daunting task.

Despite these hurdles, the potential rewards are significant. The global 3D printing market is expanding rapidly, with applications in industries ranging from automotive to healthcare. By tapping into this growth, McDonald's not only addresses environmental concerns but also positions itself as a leader in sustainable innovation within the fast-food industry.

The initiative has garnered interest from environmental groups, who praise McDonald's for its forward-thinking approach. ""It's encouraging to see a major corporation taking meaningful steps towards sustainability,"" said Lisa Zhang, director of the Green Future Initiative. ""If successful, this project could set a precedent for other companies in the fast-food sector.""

Moreover, this venture aligns with McDonald's broader sustainability goals. The company has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and has been exploring various strategies to reduce its environmental impact, including energy-efficient restaurant designs and sustainable sourcing practices.

As the project progresses, McDonald's plans to conduct further research and development to optimize the conversion process and explore additional applications for the 3D printing material. The company is also considering partnerships with other businesses to expand the use of its bio-based resin.

In the coming months, McDonald's will pilot the project in select locations, with the aim of scaling up operations if the initial results are promising. While it remains to be seen how effectively the company can implement this ambitious plan, the potential impact is undeniable.

With this bold initiative, McDonald's is not only reimagining the potential of its waste but also contributing to a more sustainable future. As the intersection of technology and sustainability continues to evolve, the fast-food giant's venture into 3D printing could pave the way for innovative solutions that benefit both the environment and the economy.",gpt
The unsung car designer who created the DeLorean and James Bond's underwater car,"In the glitzy world of iconic cars, where names like Lamborghini and Ferrari dominate, one man's contributions often go unsung, despite his pivotal role in designing some of the most memorable automobiles in cinematic and automotive history. That man is Giorgetto Giugiaro, the visionary behind the DeLorean DMC-12 and James Bond’s legendary underwater car, the Lotus Esprit.

Giugiaro’s journey into the automotive world began in the 1950s when he was just a teenager. Born in Garessio, Italy, in 1938, Giugiaro was immersed in a world of art and design from an early age. His father and grandfather were both painters, which undoubtedly influenced his creative path. By the age of 17, he was already working at Fiat, where his talent quickly caught the eye of industry leaders.

In the 1970s, Giugiaro founded Italdesign, a company that would become a beacon of innovation and creativity in car design. It was here that his genius would truly shine, crafting vehicles that not only broke the mold but also infiltrated popular culture.

Perhaps no car is more emblematic of Giugiaro’s impact than the DeLorean DMC-12. Made famous by the Back to the Future film series, the DeLorean, with its stainless steel body and gull-wing doors, is a testament to Giugiaro’s forward-thinking design ethos. Originally launched in 1981, the DeLorean was intended to be a futuristic sports car for the masses. Though production was short-lived due to the company’s financial troubles, the car’s legacy endures, thanks in large part to its silver screen appearances.

Giugiaro’s work on the DeLorean was characterized by a minimalist approach, reflecting his belief that ""simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."" The car’s sleek lines and unique features were groundbreaking at the time, and they have continued to influence automotive design long after its debut. The DeLorean’s cultural significance is undeniable, not least because of Giugiaro’s vision for what a car could be.

Yet, the DeLorean is only one chapter in Giugiaro’s illustrious career. Another of his masterpieces found its way into the world of espionage, contributing to the suave and gadget-laden universe of James Bond. The Lotus Esprit, which made its debut in 1976, was transformed into an underwater car for the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me. In a film filled with high-octane action and outlandish gadgets, the Esprit stood out, capturing the imagination of audiences around the world.

The transformation of the Esprit into a submarine was a feat of engineering and design that perfectly encapsulated the Bond aesthetic. Giugiaro’s original design for the Esprit was already striking, with its sharp, angular lines and avant-garde aesthetic. The film's producers saw the potential in Giugiaro's vision and took it to new depths, creating a vehicle that could seamlessly transition from land to water. This cinematic transformation solidified the Esprit’s place in movie history and further cemented Giugiaro’s reputation as a designer who could blend form with function in extraordinary ways.

Throughout his career, Giugiaro has been recognized for his contributions to the automotive industry. In 1999, he was named Car Designer of the Century, a testament to his enduring influence and the timelessness of his designs. Despite these accolades, Giugiaro remains a relatively underappreciated figure outside the circles of automotive enthusiasts and industry insiders.

Today, at over 80 years old, Giugiaro continues to influence the automotive world, though his role has shifted more towards consultancy and mentorship. His legacy lives on not only in the cars he designed but also in the generations of designers he has inspired. His work has proven that good design transcends time, leaving a lasting impression that goes beyond the showroom floor.

As we look back on the cars that have defined eras and inspired imaginations, it is clear that Giugiaro’s contributions are as vital as they are visionary. From the futuristic allure of the DeLorean to the transformative magic of the Lotus Esprit, Giugiaro’s designs remind us of the power of creativity and innovation in shaping the world around us. Truly, he is a designer whose work deserves to be celebrated far and wide, not just for the cars he created but for the dreams he brought to life.",gpt
Nordic Prime Ministers: We are committed to protecting women's rights,"In a unified and resounding declaration, the Prime Ministers of the Nordic countries—Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland—have reiterated their unwavering commitment to safeguarding and advancing women's rights across the region. In a joint statement released after a summit held in Helsinki, the leaders emphasized the critical importance of gender equality as a fundamental pillar of their societies, vowing to continue their work in ensuring that women's rights remain a priority in both domestic and international arenas.

The summit, which has become an annual event, serves as a platform for the Nordic countries to discuss and coordinate their strategies on various pressing issues, with gender equality consistently at the forefront of their agenda. This year's discussions were particularly charged, given the backdrop of global challenges to women's rights, including rollbacks in reproductive rights, gender-based violence, and inequality in the workforce.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson stated, ""In the face of rising global challenges, it is imperative that we stand firm in our commitment to protect and promote women's rights. The Nordic countries have always been at the forefront of gender equality, but we must continue to push forward, ensuring that every woman and girl can live free from discrimination and violence.""

The Nordic countries have long been regarded as leaders in gender equality, frequently topping global rankings for their efforts in closing gender gaps in education, health, political empowerment, and economic participation. However, the Prime Ministers acknowledged that there is still work to be done, particularly in addressing gender-based violence and ensuring equal opportunities in the workforce.

Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin highlighted the economic imperative of gender equality, noting that equal participation of women in the workforce is not only a moral obligation but also an economic necessity. ""Empowering women and ensuring their full participation in the workforce leads to stronger economies and more resilient societies. We must continue to dismantle barriers and create environments where women can thrive in all sectors,"" Marin emphasized.

The commitment to women's rights also extends to foreign policy, with the Nordic countries pledging to use their influence on the international stage to advocate for gender equality. Icelandic Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir pointed out that the Nordic model of gender equality can serve as an inspiration for other countries striving to achieve similar goals. ""We have a responsibility to lead by example and to support other nations in their efforts to advance women's rights. Our commitment to gender equality does not stop at our borders; it is a global imperative.""

In addition to policy commitments, the summit also addressed the need for cultural change to combat deeply ingrained gender stereotypes and biases. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen spoke about the importance of education in promoting gender equality from a young age. ""We must educate our children about equality and respect, instilling in them the values that will help eradicate gender discrimination. It is through education that we can create lasting change,"" she said.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre added that technology and innovation could be powerful tools in advancing women's rights. By leveraging digital platforms and new technologies, the Nordic countries aim to bridge the gap in access to information and resources, particularly for women in remote and underserved areas.

The summit concluded with a pledge from the Prime Ministers to hold each other accountable and to regularly assess their progress in meeting their gender equality goals. They also called on other world leaders to join them in prioritizing women's rights and to collaborate on finding solutions to the challenges faced by women globally.

As the Nordic countries continue to champion gender equality, their commitment serves as a beacon of hope and a call to action for the international community. With their leadership and example, they aim to inspire a global movement towards a more equitable and just world for all women and girls.",gpt
You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies,"In an era where misinformation can spread like wildfire across social media platforms, the adage ""You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies"" resonates with increasing urgency. Recent events, from political debacles to corporate scandals, highlight the perilous consequences of constructing narratives atop deceitful foundations.

Consider the case of a tech giant recently exposed for manipulating data about its environmental impact. For years, the company touted itself as a leader in sustainability, boasting of reduced carbon footprints and eco-friendly initiatives. However, investigative journalists uncovered that the corporation had systematically falsified reports to present a greener image. Internally, emissions were soaring, and waste management practices fell far short of claimed standards.

The repercussions of such deceit are manifold. Shareholders, initially attracted by the company's purported ethical stance, found themselves investing in a mirage. Consumers, seeking to support environmentally responsible businesses, were unwittingly contributing to the very problems they hoped to mitigate. The breach of trust has not only tarnished the company's reputation but also fueled skepticism towards the tech industry's broader sustainability claims.

This scenario is not isolated. Across different sectors, the temptation to embellish or fabricate truths to gain competitive advantage or public favor is alarmingly prevalent. In politics, the distortion of facts for electoral gain has become a focal point of democratic concern. The 2020 U.S. presidential election, for instance, was marred by rampant misinformation campaigns, some so insidious that they undermined public confidence in the electoral process itself.

The psychological and social ramifications of such deceit extend beyond immediate mistrust. When the public repeatedly encounters falsehoods presented as truths, a dangerous cynicism can develop. People may begin to question legitimate information, blurring the lines between fact and fiction. This erosion of trust in information sources can lead to apathy and disengagement, weakening the very fabric of informed citizenry required for a functioning democracy.

Corporate and political entities are not the only culprits. Social media platforms, while offering unprecedented connectivity and access to information, serve as fertile grounds for the dissemination of falsehoods. Algorithms designed to maximize engagement often amplify sensationalist content, irrespective of its veracity. Consequently, misinformation can achieve virality, shaping public perception and discourse far more effectively than sober, fact-based reporting.

Efforts to combat this phenomenon are underway, but they face significant challenges. Fact-checking organizations have sprouted worldwide, attempting to verify claims and dispel myths. However, their reach is limited, and their findings often lack the sensational appeal that drives engagement. Moreover, in polarized environments, fact-checking can be perceived as biased or partisan, further complicating efforts to establish a shared reality.

Education is a critical component in addressing this issue. Promoting media literacy from a young age can equip individuals with the skills to critically assess information, discern credible sources, and resist the allure of sensationalism. Equally important is fostering a culture that values truth and transparency over expediency and short-term gain.

Ultimately, the integrity of information is a cornerstone of trust in both institutions and interpersonal relationships. ""You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies"" serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of this trust. In a world awash with information, discerning truth from falsehood is not merely an intellectual exercise but a moral imperative.

The path forward requires collective commitment—from individuals demanding accountability, to institutions prioritizing transparency, and platforms taking responsibility for the content they promote. Only then can we hope to rebuild trust and ensure that truth prevails over deception in shaping our shared future.",gpt
21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India,"India is grappling with a significant air pollution crisis, as a recent study reveals that 21 out of the world's 30 most polluted cities are located within its borders. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for comprehensive policy measures and community action to combat what has become one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

The report, compiled by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company, examined 30 cities with the highest levels of PM2.5 pollutants. PM2.5, particulate matter that measures less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is known for its adverse health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no safe level of PM2.5, making these findings particularly concerning.

Among the Indian cities identified, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh tops the list, followed closely by Delhi, India's capital. Other cities include Noida, Gurugram, Greater Noida, and several others across the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan. These regions are known for their industrial activities, vehicular emissions, and agricultural practices, all of which contribute to the deteriorating air quality.

Experts suggest that the primary sources of pollution in these cities are vehicular emissions, industrial discharges, and crop-burning practices. During winter months, the situation worsens as weather patterns trap pollutants close to the ground, leading to severe smog conditions. This exacerbates health issues for the local population, particularly children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions.

The Indian government has been under increasing pressure to address this escalating crisis. Initiatives such as the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in 2019, aim to reduce PM2.5 levels by 20-30% over a five-year period. However, progress has been slow, and experts argue that more stringent measures and effective enforcement are required to see tangible improvements.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal recently announced a series of measures to tackle air pollution in the capital, including the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which involves restrictions on vehicle use, construction activities, and industrial emissions during periods of high pollution. Additionally, the city has increased its focus on promoting public transportation and introducing electric vehicle incentives.

While these efforts mark a step in the right direction, environmentalists emphasize the need for a more holistic approach. Anumita Roychowdhury, an executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, stated, ""Air pollution is not just an environmental issue but a public health emergency. It requires an integrated approach involving multiple sectors and stakeholders.""

The health implications of air pollution are immense. According to a study published in The Lancet, air pollution contributes to over one million deaths annually in India. The economic costs are staggering as well, with reduced labor productivity and increased healthcare expenses burdening the economy.

The international community is also taking note of India's air pollution woes. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has called for collaborative efforts to address the issue, underscoring the importance of global partnerships in tackling environmental challenges that transcend national borders.

Despite the grim statistics, there is room for optimism. Innovations in clean energy, technology, and sustainable practices are emerging across the country. Startups and entrepreneurs are developing solutions ranging from air purifiers to pollution-tracking apps, reflecting a growing awareness and willingness to confront the problem.

Community involvement is also critical in driving change. Grassroots movements and citizen-led initiatives are gaining momentum, pushing for cleaner air and holding authorities accountable. Educational campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the health risks of air pollution are also crucial in fostering a culture of accountability and action.

As India navigates the complexities of economic growth and environmental sustainability, the challenge remains to balance development with ecological preservation. The battle against air pollution is undoubtedly formidable, but with concerted efforts from the government, businesses, and citizens, there is hope for a cleaner, healthier future.

In conclusion, the revelation that 21 of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in India serves as a stark reminder of the urgent action needed to address air pollution. With the right policies, technologies, and community engagement, India can pave the way toward a future where clean air is no longer a luxury but a fundamental right for all its citizens.",gpt

"Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time","As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that the government's response has been inadequate on multiple fronts. From delayed actions to inconsistent messaging, the failures have been significant and have contributed to the prolonged nature of this crisis. However, despite these setbacks, there remains a window of opportunity to rectify the situation and mitigate further harm.

From the onset of the pandemic, the government's response was hampered by a lack of urgency. Initial reports of the virus were met with skepticism and downplayed in public statements, leading to a critical delay in implementing necessary precautions. This early inaction allowed the virus to spread more rapidly, overwhelming healthcare systems and exacerbating its impact on public health and the economy.

Compounding the problem was the inconsistent messaging from government officials, which sowed confusion and mistrust among the public. Mixed signals regarding the severity of the virus, mask mandates, and social distancing guidelines left many unsure of how to protect themselves and others. This communication breakdown not only hindered efforts to control the virus but also fueled the spread of misinformation, undermining public health measures.

Furthermore, the government's failure to provide adequate support to healthcare providers and workers has been glaring. With hospitals stretched to their limits, the lack of resources and protective equipment put frontline workers at risk and compromised patient care. The absence of a coherent national strategy for testing and contact tracing further impeded efforts to curb the virus's spread, leaving local governments and healthcare facilities to fend for themselves.

Economic relief measures have also fallen short, leaving many Americans struggling to make ends meet. While stimulus packages provided temporary relief, the lack of a long-term plan to support businesses and individuals has left the economy in a precarious state. As unemployment rates soared and small businesses closed their doors, the need for sustained economic intervention has become increasingly urgent.

Despite these failures, it is not too late for the government to step up and take decisive action. One of the most critical areas for improvement is the coordination of a unified national response. By establishing a clear and consistent strategy that prioritizes public health and safety, the government can restore public confidence and encourage compliance with health guidelines. This includes transparent communication about the risks of the virus, the importance of vaccinations, and the need for continued vigilance.

Investing in healthcare infrastructure and ensuring that healthcare providers have the resources they need is another crucial step. By bolstering the capacity of hospitals and clinics, the government can better prepare for potential future surges and provide patients with the care they require. Supporting healthcare workers through adequate pay and protective measures is essential to maintaining a robust health system.

On the economic front, the government must implement policies that provide long-term support for individuals and businesses. This could include targeted relief for the hardest-hit sectors, extended unemployment benefits, and initiatives to stimulate job growth. By addressing the economic fallout of the pandemic, the government can help rebuild a more resilient economy that benefits all Americans.

Finally, the government must take a proactive approach to vaccination efforts. Ensuring equitable access to vaccines, particularly in underserved communities, is vital to achieving widespread immunity and preventing further outbreaks. Public education campaigns that address vaccine hesitancy and misinformation are also necessary to encourage uptake and protect public health.

In conclusion, while the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been fraught with failures, there is still time to turn the tide. By prioritizing a coordinated national strategy, investing in healthcare, supporting the economy, and bolstering vaccination efforts, the government can begin to rectify past mistakes and safeguard the nation's future. The road ahead will not be easy, but with decisive action and a commitment to the well-being of all citizens, it is possible to emerge from this crisis stronger and more united than before.",gpt
Bristol sisters aim to raise awareness of 'honour hate',"Two sisters from Bristol are spearheading a campaign to shed light on the often-overlooked issue of ""honour hate,"" a form of abuse that stems from perceived violations of family or community expectations. This initiative comes in the wake of several high-profile cases that have highlighted the devastating consequences of such cultural practices.

Sana and Aisha Malik, aged 29 and 31 respectively, grew up in a household where traditional expectations often clashed with their personal freedoms. Their experiences have fueled their determination to address this issue, which affects thousands of individuals across the UK each year. The sisters launched the ""Honour Free"" campaign, aiming to provide education, support, and a voice to those who have been silenced by fear.

""Honour hate is a hidden crime that thrives on silence and secrecy,"" says Sana, a social worker who has encountered numerous cases of honour-based violence in her professional life. ""We want to bring this issue into the open and create a platform for survivors to share their stories and seek help.""

Honour-based violence can manifest in various forms, including physical abuse, emotional coercion, and even murder. It is rooted in the belief that a family's honour is tied to the behaviour, particularly of women, and any deviation from accepted norms can bring shame. This often leads to extreme measures taken by family members to preserve their perceived integrity.

Aisha, a community organiser, emphasises the importance of education in combating these outdated and harmful practices. ""We need to challenge the cultural norms that perpetuate honour hate and empower individuals to make their own choices without fear of retribution,"" she says. ""Education is key to breaking the cycle and preventing future generations from suffering the same fate.""

The sisters' campaign has already gained significant traction, with several local organisations and charities offering their support. Among them is ""Bristol Women's Aid,"" which provides refuge and assistance to women escaping abusive situations. The organisation's director, Helen Turner, praises the Malik sisters for their courage and commitment to the cause.

""Honour-based violence is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach,"" Turner explains. ""By raising awareness and fostering dialogue, we can begin to dismantle the structures that allow such abuse to persist.""

The campaign also seeks to influence policy changes at a governmental level. Sana and Aisha are advocating for more comprehensive training for professionals working in education, healthcare, and law enforcement to recognise and respond to signs of honour-based violence. They believe that increased awareness and understanding among professionals can lead to more effective interventions and support for victims.

The sisters' initiative comes at a crucial time, as recent statistics from the Crown Prosecution Service indicate a notable rise in reported cases of honour-based violence. In 2022, there were over 2,000 cases recorded, a significant increase from previous years. Experts suggest that this rise may be due in part to increased awareness and willingness among victims to come forward.

Nevertheless, the Malik sisters recognise that there is still a long way to go. ""We need to create a society where individuals are judged by their character and actions, not by their adherence to outdated cultural norms,"" Aisha asserts. ""Everyone has the right to live a life free from oppression and violence.""

As part of their campaign, the sisters are organising a series of workshops and events across Bristol, aimed at educating both young people and adults about honour-based violence. They hope to expand these efforts nationwide in the coming years, with the ultimate goal of eradicating honour hate entirely.

With their unwavering dedication, Sana and Aisha Malik are not just raising awareness—they are igniting a movement for change. Their efforts serve as a powerful reminder of the impact individuals can have in challenging societal injustices and advocating for a more inclusive and equitable world.

The Honour Free campaign is a beacon of hope for those suffering in silence, offering support and solidarity to those who need it most. By standing up against honour hate, the Malik sisters are paving the way for a future where everyone can live without fear of judgement or retribution based on outdated cultural expectations.",gpt
Video shows a man rescuing neighbor's dog after its leash got stuck in elevator doors,"In a heart-stopping moment caught on video, a local hero sprang into action to save his neighbor's dog after the animal's leash became caught in the doors of an elevator. The incident, which took place in a residential apartment building in downtown Seattle, has captured widespread attention and praise for the man's quick thinking and bravery.

The video, which has since gone viral on social media, was captured by the building's security cameras. It shows the dramatic rescue of a small terrier mix that found itself in a perilous situation. As the doors of the elevator began to close, the dog's owner, unaware that the leash was still outside, stepped into the elevator cab, leaving the dog behind in the hallway.

Seconds before the elevator began its ascent, a neighbor, identified as Michael Harris, turned the corner onto the landing. Harris immediately noticed the predicament and, without a moment's hesitation, leapt into action. The footage shows Harris sprinting towards the dog and deftly unclipping the leash just as the elevator began to move upwards, preventing what could have been a tragic accident.

""I was just coming back from walking my own dog when I saw what was happening,"" Harris recounted in an interview. ""I didn’t think; I just reacted. I acted on instinct. I’m just glad I was there at the right time.""

The dog's owner, who has chosen to remain anonymous, expressed immense gratitude for Harris's actions. ""It's something that never even crossed my mind could happen,"" she said. ""I can’t thank Michael enough. He saved my dog's life.""

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers posed by automatic doors and the importance of remaining vigilant when using elevators with pets. Experts advise pet owners to keep their dogs on short leashes and to always ensure their pets are safely inside the elevator before stepping in themselves.

Harris has been lauded as a local hero, and residents of the apartment building have expressed their admiration for his courage and quick thinking. Building management has also taken steps to remind tenants of elevator safety protocols, especially concerning pets. Notices have been placed in common areas, and plans are underway to host a community meeting to discuss safety measures.

The video has sparked a lively discussion online, with many viewers expressing a mix of relief and gratitude for the positive outcome. On social media platforms, users have shared similar stories, emphasizing the need for awareness and caution in similar situations. The footage has also been shared by animal advocacy groups, who are using the incident to educate pet owners about elevator safety.

""This could have ended very differently if not for Michael's actions,"" said Laura Simmons, director of a local animal protection organization. ""Pet safety is something we all need to be mindful of, and incidents like this highlight the importance of community vigilance and quick response.""

Despite the attention and accolades, Harris remains humble about his actions. ""I did what anyone else would have done,"" he said. ""I love dogs, and I just couldn’t stand by and watch something happen to one.""

The incident has prompted calls for increased safety measures in residential buildings, with some residents suggesting the installation of sensors that detect when an object or leash is caught in elevator doors. Others have proposed the implementation of educational programs for new residents to ensure they are aware of potential hazards.

In the wake of this incident, the community has rallied around Harris, celebrating his heroism and reflecting on the importance of looking out for one another. For now, the little terrier mix is safe and sound, a testament to the power of quick thinking and neighborly intervention.

As the video continues to circulate online, it serves as both a cautionary tale and an inspiring reminder of the everyday heroes who live among us, ready to act when the moment calls for it.",gpt

However, the BBC is not without its challenges. In recent years, the corporation has faced scrutiny over its funding model, which relies heavily on the UK television license fee. Critics argue that this funding mechanism is outdated in the age of digital streaming, prompting debates about the need for reform. Additionally, the BBC has faced pressure from political entities seeking to influence its content and operations. Despite these challenges, the corporation has remained steadfast in its mission to provide impartial and comprehensive news coverage.

The digital age has also brought about changes in the way audiences consume news. To adapt, the BBC has embraced new technologies and platforms, launching apps, podcasts, and social media channels to engage younger audiences. These efforts have paid off, with the BBC's digital platforms regularly ranking among the most visited news sites globally.

The BBC's adaptation extends to its editorial approach as well. Recognizing the growing importance of multimedia storytelling, the corporation has invested in producing visually engaging content.

How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef,"In a significant shift that marks a new era for fast food, McDonald's has successfully transitioned to using fresh beef in their Quarter Pounder burgers across all U.S. locations. This strategic move, initiated in 2018, aims to meet evolving consumer demands for higher quality, fresher ingredients and to stay competitive in a rapidly changing market.

The journey towards fresh beef began with years of planning and substantial investment. McDonald's, known for its consistency and efficiency, faced the daunting task of overhauling its supply chain—a network that had been fine-tuned over decades to deliver frozen patties efficiently and cost-effectively. The decision to pivot towards fresh beef required not only logistical adjustments but also a cultural shift within the company.

Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's president and CEO, acknowledged the challenges involved. ""Switching from frozen to fresh beef wasn't just a matter of flipping a switch,"" he said. ""It required us to rethink every aspect of our supply chain, from sourcing and logistics to training our staff on new cooking methods.""

The transition began with pilot tests in over 300 restaurants across Texas and Oklahoma in 2017. During this phase, McDonald's worked closely with its suppliers, ensuring that the beef met the company's stringent quality and safety standards. The company partnered with suppliers to develop new methods for processing and delivering fresh beef patties while maintaining the speed and efficiency McDonald's is known for.

One of the most significant changes was in the kitchen. Employees had to be trained to handle and cook fresh beef properly, as the preparation differs from the frozen patties they were accustomed to. This training ensured that every Quarter Pounder was cooked to perfection, providing customers with a juicier, more flavorful burger.

The switch to fresh beef also meant McDonald's had to address potential safety concerns. The company implemented rigorous safety protocols, including temperature controls and regular audits, to ensure that the fresh beef remained safe from farm to table. These measures were essential in maintaining customer trust in the brand's commitment to quality and safety.

Consumer response to the change has been overwhelmingly positive. Many customers noticed the improved taste and quality of the burgers, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction. The fresh beef initiative has been credited with boosting McDonald's U.S. sales by 4.5% in the first quarter following the nationwide rollout.

Industry experts note that the shift to fresh beef is part of a broader trend towards transparency and quality in the fast-food industry. As consumers become more health-conscious and informed about their food choices, companies are being pushed to improve their offerings. McDonald's move to fresh beef is seen as a strategic response to these changing consumer preferences, aligning with the broader industry movement towards fresher, more natural ingredients.

The transition has also placed pressure on McDonald's competitors to follow suit. As the world's largest fast-food chain sets new standards, others in the industry may feel compelled to adapt to meet consumer expectations. Some competitors have already begun exploring similar changes, further pushing the industry towards a future where fresh ingredients become the norm rather than the exception.

Despite the challenges, McDonald's switch to fresh beef has proven to be a successful venture, underscoring the company's ability to innovate and adapt in a competitive market. The move not only enhances the quality of its iconic Quarter Pounder but also reinforces McDonald's commitment to meeting customer expectations and staying ahead in the fast-food industry.

Looking forward, McDonald's plans to continue exploring opportunities to improve its menu offerings. The success of the fresh beef initiative has set a precedent for future innovations, and the company remains committed to leading the industry towards a future where quality and convenience go hand in hand.

In making the switch to fresh beef, McDonald's has not only responded to consumer demands but has also reinforced its position as a leading innovator in the fast-food sector. As the company continues to evolve, its focus on quality and customer satisfaction will likely remain at the forefront of its strategy, setting new benchmarks for the industry as a whole.",gpt
March 9 coronavirus news,"As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, March 9 has brought a mix of developments, concerns, and hopes in the global fight against COVID-19. 

In the United States, health officials have reported a steady decline in daily new cases, sparking cautious optimism. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the seven-day average of new infections has decreased by 15% over the past week. This decline is attributed to a combination of widespread vaccination efforts, natural immunity from previous infections, and continued adherence to public health measures. However, experts warn that vigilance is crucial, as new variants of the virus continue to emerge.

On the vaccination front, the U.S. has reached a significant milestone, with over 80% of the adult population having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The Biden administration's push to increase vaccine accessibility and combat misinformation has been pivotal in achieving this milestone. In a press briefing, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci emphasized the importance of booster shots, particularly for vulnerable populations, stating that ""booster doses are essential in maintaining high levels of protection against severe disease.""

Meanwhile, Europe faces a more complicated situation, with several countries experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Germany, France, and Italy have reported an uptick in infections, driven largely by the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron. In response, governments are re-evaluating their public health strategies. Germany has reinstated mask mandates in public indoor spaces, and Italy is considering similar measures. French Health Minister Olivier Véran has urged citizens to exercise caution, highlighting the need for booster vaccinations.

In Asia, China remains steadfast in its ""zero-COVID"" policy, despite challenges posed by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Shanghai, one of the country's major financial hubs, has imposed targeted lockdowns in several districts after a spike in cases. The Chinese government continues to implement strict testing, quarantine, and isolation measures in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. However, these measures have sparked some public frustration and economic concerns, as businesses face disruptions.

Japan, on the other hand, is preparing to ease border restrictions for international travelers. Starting next month, the Japanese government will lift the ban on foreign tourists, marking a significant shift in its COVID-19 strategy. Officials emphasize that travelers must be fully vaccinated and undergo testing prior to entry. This move is seen as a way to revitalize the tourism industry, which has suffered significant losses since the pandemic began.

In Africa, vaccination rates remain a concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the disparity in vaccine distribution, noting that only 20% of the continent's population has received at least one dose. Efforts to boost vaccine supply and distribution continue, with international organizations and governments working to address logistical challenges. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for increased investment in healthcare infrastructure and local vaccine production to enhance Africa's pandemic response.

Splayed Roast Chicken With Caramelized Ramps Recipe,"In the culinary world, few dishes evoke the comforting allure of a well-roasted chicken. The crispy skin, the tender, flavorful meat, and the aroma filling the kitchen are enough to draw anyone to the table. But what happens when you elevate this classic dish with the unique, garlicky sweetness of caramelized ramps? The result is a splayed roast chicken with caramelized ramps—a dish that not only satisfies the palate but also celebrates the fleeting beauty of spring ingredients.

Ramps, sometimes known as wild leeks, are a highly sought-after ingredient in the spring season. Their delicate, garlicky flavor and vibrant green leaves make them a favorite among chefs and home cooks alike. When caramelized, ramps add a depth of flavor that transforms a simple roast chicken into a gourmet experience. This dish is perfect for those looking to impress dinner guests or simply enjoy a delightful meal at home.

The secret to this recipe lies in the splaying technique. Splaying a chicken involves removing the backbone and flattening it, allowing for even cooking. This technique ensures that the skin crisps up beautifully while keeping the meat juicy and tender. It’s a method that’s quickly gaining popularity among home cooks looking for a foolproof way to roast chicken.

To begin, you’ll need a whole chicken, preferably organic and free-range for the best flavor and texture. Using a sharp pair of kitchen shears, remove the backbone by cutting along either side of it. Once removed, flip the chicken over and press down firmly on the breastbone to flatten it. This splaying process might seem daunting at first, but it’s a simple technique once you get the hang of it.

Next, prepare the ramps by trimming the roots and washing them thoroughly to remove any dirt. Separate the white bulbs from the green leaves. The bulbs will be caramelized alongside the chicken, while the leaves can be added towards the end of the cooking process to retain their vibrant color and fresh flavor.

Season the chicken generously with salt, pepper, and a touch of olive oil or melted butter. Arrange the chicken in a roasting pan, skin-side up, and scatter the ramp bulbs around it. The ramps will soak up the flavorful juices from the chicken as they caramelize, becoming tender and sweet.

Roast the chicken in a preheated oven at 425°F (220°C) for about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the bird. Halfway through the cooking process, add the ramp leaves to the pan. Their quick cook time ensures they retain their bright green hue and fresh taste. Keep an eye on the chicken, basting it occasionally with the pan juices to enhance the flavor and moisture.

Once the chicken is cooked through, with an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C) at the thickest part of the thigh, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring each bite is succulent and flavorful.

Serve the splayed roast chicken with the caramelized ramps, perhaps alongside a simple green salad or roasted potatoes to complete the meal. The combination of juicy chicken and sweet, garlicky ramps is a testament to the power of seasonal ingredients and straightforward cooking techniques.

For those who enjoy pairing their meals with wine, a crisp white such as a Sauvignon Blanc or a light red like a Pinot Noir complements the dish beautifully, balancing the richness of the chicken and the sweetness of the ramps.

In a world where culinary trends come and go, the splayed roast chicken with caramelized ramps stands as a timeless tribute to the joys of simple, seasonal cooking. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a home cook, this recipe is sure to become a staple in your springtime repertoire. Enjoy the fleeting season of ramps while it lasts, and let this dish be a reminder of the delicious simplicity that nature has to offer.",gpt
Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely,"As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, health experts emphasize the importance of maintaining hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus. While handwashing and wearing masks have become second nature, one frequently touched item is often overlooked: our smartphones. With studies suggesting that smartphones can harbor more germs than a toilet seat, cleaning these devices safely is crucial.

Smartphones are indispensable in our daily lives, acting as portals to both information and communication. However, their constant exposure to surfaces—often being placed on tables, held in hands, or even taken into bathrooms—makes them potential vectors for germs, including the coronavirus.

To clean your smartphone effectively without damaging it, follow these expert-recommended steps:

**1. Power Down and Unplug**  
Before cleaning, always power down your smartphone and unplug it from any charging cables. This reduces the risk of electrical shock and ensures you won’t accidentally activate any functions while cleaning.

**2. Use a Microfiber Cloth**  
A microfiber cloth is your best friend when it comes to cleaning electronic screens. Unlike paper towels or napkins, microfiber cloths are non-abrasive and won’t leave scratches. Gently wipe the screen and body of your phone to remove fingerprints and smudges.

**3. Avoid Excessive Moisture**  
While some smartphones are water-resistant, it’s essential to avoid excessive moisture that could seep into the device. Instead of soaking your cloth, dampen it lightly with water or an approved cleaning solution.

**4. Opt for Alcohol-Based Wipes or Solutions**  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises using disinfectants with at least 70% alcohol for effective virus elimination. Many manufacturers, including Apple, recommend using isopropyl alcohol wipes or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. These are effective in neutralizing the virus without harming the phone’s oleophobic (oil-repellent) and hydrophobic (water-repellent) coatings.

**5. Be Cautious with Ports and Openings**  
When cleaning, take care to avoid any ports or openings to prevent liquid damage. Use a dry cotton swab or a soft-bristled brush to clean around buttons or camera lenses.

**6. Regular Cleaning Routine**  
Incorporate a regular cleaning routine into your day. While there’s no universally prescribed frequency, cleaning your phone at least once daily, especially after being in public places, can reduce germ buildup.

**7. Hands-Free Usage**  
Whenever possible, consider using hands-free options like Bluetooth headsets or speaker mode to minimize direct contact with your phone. This can be particularly useful when you’re in potentially contaminated environments.

**8. Use a UV Sanitizer**  
For those seeking an alternative to chemical cleaning, UV sanitizers have become popular. These devices use ultraviolet light to kill bacteria and viruses on your phone’s surface. While research on their effectiveness against coronavirus is ongoing, they offer a chemical-free cleaning option.

As the pandemic persists, staying informed and adopting effective hygiene practices remain key to safety. With our smartphones being such integral parts of our lives, ensuring they are clean is not just about device maintenance but also about protecting our health.

While these steps are effective, it’s also crucial to remain updated with guidelines from health organizations and smartphone manufacturers, as recommendations may evolve with new research. 

With technology being a lifeline during these challenging times—connecting us to work, family, and essential services—a little effort in maintaining its cleanliness can go a long way in safeguarding our health.",gpt
Tom Blachford's upside-down urban landscapes will make you look twice,"In the ever-evolving realm of contemporary photography, where innovation meets aesthetic brilliance, Australian photographer Tom Blachford has carved a niche that defies conventional perspectives. His latest project, a captivating series of upside-down urban landscapes, invites audiences to rethink their visual interpretations of cityscapes and challenges the boundaries of traditional photography.

Blachford, renowned for his nocturnal explorations of architecture and urban environments, has taken a bold step with this new series. By inverting the familiar skyline, he presents a fresh lens through which to view the urban world. The result is a collection of images that are both disorienting and mesmerizing, compelling viewers to engage with them in a more profound way.

The upside-down technique is not merely a gimmick but a calculated artistic decision. Blachford's meticulous attention to detail ensures that each photograph is a carefully crafted composition that maintains visual harmony despite its inversion. By flipping the urban landscapes, he transforms the mundane into the extraordinary, encouraging viewers to pause and reflect on the intricacies of the built environment.

One of the standout images from the series features the iconic skyline of New York City. Seen upside-down, the towering skyscrapers appear to defy gravity, their reflections merging seamlessly with the sky. This optical illusion creates a dreamlike quality, inviting viewers to question their perceptions of space and balance. The familiar becomes unfamiliar, prompting a double-take that is as bewildering as it is beautiful.

Blachford's work is not only an exploration of visual aesthetics but also a commentary on the nature of modern urban life. By presenting cities from an inverted perspective, he highlights the complex interplay between architecture and the natural world. The series serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between human innovation and the environment, urging viewers to consider the impact of urbanization on the planet.

The inspiration for the series, according to Blachford, came from a desire to challenge the traditional narrative of cityscapes. ""I wanted to create something that would make people stop and think,"" he explains. ""Turning the world upside down forces us to consider our surroundings in a new way and to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the cities we live in.""

Blachford's artistic journey began with a fascination for architecture and the interplay of light and shadow. His previous projects, such as the acclaimed ""Midnight Modern"" series, have explored the ethereal beauty of mid-century modern homes under the moonlight. With this new venture, he continues to push the boundaries of photographic innovation, using inversion as a tool to provoke thought and spark conversation.

The reception to Blachford's upside-down landscapes has been overwhelmingly positive, with art critics and enthusiasts alike praising his ingenuity and creativity. The series has been showcased in prominent galleries worldwide, captivating audiences with its unique approach to urban photography. Many have lauded Blachford for his ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, offering a fresh perspective on familiar scenes.

As the series gains traction, Blachford remains committed to exploring new ways to challenge visual norms. ""Photography is an ever-evolving medium,"" he says. ""There's always room to experiment and push boundaries. With this series, I hope to inspire others to see the world differently.""

In an age where digital manipulation and virtual realities are becoming increasingly prevalent, Blachford's work stands out for its simplicity and elegance. By using inversion as a tool for artistic expression, he invites viewers to engage with the real world in a more meaningful way.

Through his lens, the urban landscape becomes a canvas for exploration and discovery, challenging us to see the familiar with fresh eyes and an open mind.",gpt
"4 of your latest coronavirus questions, answered","As the coronavirus pandemic continues to evolve, new questions and concerns arise. Here are answers to four of the latest questions being asked about COVID-19.

**1. How effective are the updated COVID-19 vaccines against new variants?**

The emergence of new variants has been a major concern throughout the pandemic. The latest booster shots, updated for the fall season, have been designed to target the XBB.1.5 variant, which was prevalent earlier this year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these updated vaccines also offer some protection against newer variants, such as EG.5 and BA.2.86, which have been circulating more recently.

Experts note that while the vaccines may not completely prevent infection from these new strains, they are effective in reducing the severity of illness and preventing hospitalizations. Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, emphasizes that staying up to date with vaccinations remains one of the best defenses against severe outcomes of COVID-19.

**2. What are the current recommendations for mask-wearing?**

With the rise and fall of COVID-19 cases, mask-wearing guidelines have continued to fluctuate. As of now, the CDC recommends mask-wearing based on the COVID-19 Community Level in your area. In regions with high transmission levels, wearing masks in indoor public spaces is advised, regardless of vaccination status.

For areas with medium transmission, individuals at higher risk of severe illness, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, are encouraged to wear masks indoors. In areas with low transmission, masks are less necessary but still recommended in crowded or poorly ventilated settings.

Local authorities and institutions may have additional guidelines, so it's important to stay informed about the rules in your area. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, former CDC director, also highlights the importance of personal choice and comfort, encouraging individuals to wear masks if it makes them feel safer.

**3. Are there any new treatments available for COVID-19?**

Recent advancements in COVID-19 treatment have focused on making therapies more accessible and effective. Paxlovid, an antiviral medication, continues to be a widely prescribed treatment for COVID-19, particularly for high-risk patients. The drug has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of severe illness if taken early in the course of infection.

Additionally, researchers are developing monoclonal antibodies that target newer variants more effectively. While some previously authorized monoclonal antibodies have lost efficacy against current variants, new formulations are in the pipeline and are expected to receive authorization in the coming months.

Dr. Janet Woodcock, principal deputy commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), emphasizes that early testing and diagnosis remain critical for the timely administration of these treatments. She suggests that individuals who test positive for COVID-19 consult healthcare providers promptly to discuss treatment options.

**4. How is long COVID being addressed in ongoing research?**

Long COVID, characterized by symptoms persisting for weeks or months after the initial infection, remains a significant concern for many. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has launched a large-scale initiative known as RECOVER to better understand and address the long-term effects of COVID-19.

This initiative aims to identify the causes of long COVID, as well as potential treatments. Preliminary findings suggest that long COVID may result from an overactive immune response, lingering viral particles, or microclots affecting blood flow. Researchers are exploring a range of therapies, from anti-inflammatory drugs to anticoagulants, to alleviate symptoms.

Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, notes that while there is still much to learn, the ongoing research is promising. He encourages individuals experiencing prolonged symptoms to participate in clinical studies, as their involvement is crucial for advancing understanding and treatment of long COVID.

These answers reflect the ongoing efforts of health professionals and researchers to adapt to the evolving challenges posed by COVID-19. Staying informed and following public health guidance remain essential in navigating this complex landscape.",gpt
These people could make Trump's life miserable,"Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is no stranger to controversy and legal battles. However, as he navigates his post-presidency era, a new cohort of individuals and groups pose significant challenges to his personal and professional life.

At the forefront of this list are prosecutors like Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Bragg is overseeing a criminal investigation into Trump's business practices, scrutinizing potential financial fraud within the Trump Organization. James, on the other hand, has been leading a civil investigation into similar allegations. Both cases could lead to substantial legal repercussions, heavy fines, or even criminal charges, making them critical players in Trump's current legal landscape.

Adding to the pressure, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia is investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. The inquiry has already seen the convening of a special grand jury, and Willis has not ruled out the possibility of seeking indictments. This investigation looms large over Trump, as it directly ties to his controversial actions following his electoral defeat.

Parallel to these legal threats, Trump faces challenges from within the Republican Party. Figures like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, vocal critics of Trump, have sought to hold him accountable for his role in the January 6 Capitol riots. Though Kinzinger has since left Congress, Cheney continues to be a formidable adversary, leveraging her influence to sway public opinion and encourage accountability for Trump's actions during his presidency.

The media landscape also remains a battleground for Trump. Journalists and authors continue to publish revealing accounts of his presidency, often painting a less-than-flattering portrait of his administration. Investigative reporters, armed with leaks and insider accounts, have the potential to sway public opinion and keep Trump's past controversies in the spotlight.

In the realm of civil litigation, Trump faces multiple lawsuits, ranging from allegations of sexual misconduct to defamation suits. E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against Trump, arising from his denial of her rape allegation, has gained particular attention. A ruling against Trump in any of these cases could result in significant financial penalties and further tarnish his public image.

Moreover, Trump's digital footprint remains a double-edged sword. While he maintains a strong following on platforms like Truth Social, his permanent suspension from Twitter continues to limit his reach. Social media companies and their policies play a crucial role in shaping Trump's ability to communicate with his base, and any further restrictions could hinder his influence.

The financial sector also plays a significant role in Trump's post-presidency challenges. Deutsche Bank, one of his major lenders, has reportedly distanced itself from Trump, raising questions about his financial stability and potential difficulties in securing future loans. This financial scrutiny could impact Trump's businesses, particularly as he faces mounting legal expenses.

Trump's ambitions for a potential 2024 presidential run introduce yet another layer of complexity. Political adversaries, both within and outside the Republican Party, are likely to scrutinize his every move, looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. Democrats, buoyed by their 2020 success, will undoubtedly aim to capitalize on any legal or financial woes Trump encounters.

Public opinion is also a crucial factor. Polls suggest a divided nation, with Trump's approval ratings fluctuating amid ongoing controversies. Should these legal battles and investigations yield negative outcomes for Trump, they could sway undecided voters and further polarize his support base.

In the face of these challenges, Trump remains defiant, often dismissing investigations as politically motivated ""witch hunts."" His loyal supporters echo this sentiment, underscoring the deep divisions within American politics. However, the cumulative effect of these legal, financial, and political pressures could significantly impact his future endeavors, both in business and in any potential political comeback.

Ultimately, the individuals and institutions scrutinizing Trump have the potential to significantly influence his legacy and future. As these legal battles and investigations unfold, they could indeed make Trump's life increasingly complicated and unpredictable. Whether these challenges will deter him or galvanize his base remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Donald Trump is far from fading quietly into the background of American political life.",gpt
Ellie and Nele: From she to he - and back to she again,"In a quiet corner of Antwerp, Belgium, the story of Ellie and Nele is capturing the attention and hearts of many, offering a profound glimpse into the journey of gender identity and the personal battles that accompany it. Ellie and Nele, a married couple, have traversed a unique path of identity exploration, transitioning from female to male, and then back to female again, challenging societal norms and expectations in the process.

Their story begins with Ellie, who, for much of her early life, felt a profound disconnect between her gender identity and her assigned sex at birth. Growing up, Ellie struggled with traditional gender roles and expectations, feeling increasingly alienated from the societal norms that dictated how she should live and express herself. ""It was like living in a body that wasn’t mine,"" she recalls, her voice unwavering yet reflective of the struggles she endured.

Ellie's journey took a decisive turn when she met Nele, who was then exploring his identity as a transgender man. The two connected over shared experiences and the mutual understanding of what it meant to live in a world that often felt at odds with their internal realities. Together, they embarked on a journey of self-discovery and transition, with Ellie initially deciding to transition to male, becoming Eli, to align her physical appearance with her gender identity.

During this period, Ellie, now Eli, and Nele supported each other through the challenges of transition—hormone therapies, surgeries, and the social ramifications of their choices. Eli recalls the relief that came with each step closer to a body that felt more congruent with his identity, yet there was an underlying tension that remained unaddressed. ""At first, it felt like I was finally becoming myself,"" Eli admits. ""But there was always a part of me that wasn’t entirely at peace.""

Nele, too, was experiencing his own revelations. As time passed, he grappled with feelings of discontent and an evolving understanding of his gender identity. Their mutual support became a lifeline as they navigated these turbulent waters together. ""We were each other’s anchors,"" Nele explains. ""It was comforting to know that no matter where our journeys took us, we had each other.""

The turning point came unexpectedly, as both Ellie and Nele began to reassess their transitions. For Ellie, the realization that she might have made a misstep in her transition was daunting. ""I felt like I had to start over, but I also knew I had gained invaluable insights into who I truly was,"" she reflects. Nele, too, was coming to terms with a similar realization, deciding that he wanted to return to living as male.

The couple’s decision to transition back to their original genders was met with mixed reactions from their community. While some expressed confusion, others offered unwavering support. Ellie and Nele faced questions not only from those around them but from themselves, as they grappled with the intricacies of identity and the fluidity of gender.

Their journey, documented in a series of candid interviews and personal essays, has sparked conversations across Belgium and beyond about the complexities of gender identity and the courage it takes to live authentically. Ellie and Nele have become advocates for a more nuanced understanding of gender, emphasizing that gender identity is not a linear path but a personal journey that can shift and evolve over time.

""We want people to know that it’s okay to change, to explore, and to not have all the answers,"" Ellie says, her determination and resilience evident. Nele echoes her sentiments, adding, ""Our story is about love, acceptance, and the freedom to be who you are, whoever that may be.""

As Ellie and Nele continue to navigate their lives together, they hope their story will inspire others to embrace their true selves, regardless of societal pressures or expectations. Their journey serves as a testament to the power of love, acceptance, and the human spirit’s capacity for growth and change in the face of adversity.",gpt

Saudi Arabia detains senior members of its royal family,"In a dramatic move that has sent ripples across the global political landscape, Saudi Arabia has detained several senior members of its royal family, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. The detentions are reportedly part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent within the kingdom, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Among those detained are two of the most prominent figures in the Saudi royal hierarchy: Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister. Their detentions mark a significant escalation in the Crown Prince’s consolidation of power, as both individuals have been considered potential threats to his authority.

The arrests took place late Friday night, and the Saudi authorities have yet to provide an official statement regarding the reasons behind the detentions. However, insiders suggest that the move is part of a broader strategy by the Crown Prince to eliminate any potential challenges to his succession and solidify his path to the throne.

This latest purge follows a pattern of aggressive measures by the Crown Prince to fortify his control over Saudi Arabia. Since his rise to prominence in 2017, Mohammed bin Salman has undertaken a series of bold reforms under the banner of Vision 2030, a plan aimed at diversifying the kingdom’s oil-dependent economy. However, his tenure has also been marked by controversies, including the arrest of numerous activists, scholars, and business leaders.

The detention of Prince Ahmed and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef has raised alarm among international observers and allies. Both figures were considered to be influential within the royal family and held considerable sway among the kingdom's traditional power brokers. Prince Ahmed, who has lived abroad for several years, was seen as a potential unifying figure among factions within the royal family. Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was respected for his role in counterterrorism efforts and had strong ties with Western intelligence agencies.

The United States, a key ally of Saudi Arabia, is reportedly monitoring the situation closely. A senior official from the State Department, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “We are aware of the reports out of Saudi Arabia and are following the developments closely. We urge transparency and adherence to legal processes.”

The detentions are likely to have far-reaching implications for the kingdom’s internal dynamics and its relationship with the international community. Analysts suggest that this move could further consolidate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s power but may also exacerbate tensions within the royal family, potentially leading to instability.

Critics of the Crown Prince argue that his approach to governance has often sidelined traditional consensus-building mechanisms within the royal family, opting instead for a more centralized and authoritarian style. This latest crackdown is seen by some as an attempt to quash any dissenting voices and ensure an uncontested transition to the throne.

Human rights organizations have also expressed concern over the detentions, emphasizing the need for transparency and due process. Amnesty International issued a statement calling for the immediate release of those detained, citing fears of arbitrary detention and possible mistreatment.

As the situation unfolds, the world will be watching closely to see how these developments impact the future of Saudi Arabia. The kingdom is at a critical juncture, balancing its ambitious reform agenda with the need to maintain stability both domestically and in its regional relations.

For now, the detentions of senior royal family members remain shrouded in uncertainty, leaving many questions unanswered about the future path of Saudi governance under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The world waits to see whether this will indeed secure his position or ignite further challenges within the royal corridors of power.",gpt
Tourists being kept under coronavirus quarantine at luxury Maldives resort,"In an unprecedented turn of events, holidaymakers at the luxurious Maldives resort of Kuredu Island have found themselves in quarantine amid concerns over the novel coronavirus. As the global pandemic continues to reshape travel and tourism, these tourists are experiencing an unexpected extension of their stay, albeit under strict containment measures.

Reports from Kuredu Island indicate that several guests and staff members have been isolated after two employees tested positive for COVID-19. The resort, known for its pristine beaches, overwater villas, and exquisite dining, has turned into a temporary holding ground as health officials work diligently to assess the situation.

""We were initially alarmed when we heard the news,"" said Susan Miller, a tourist from the United States. ""But the resort management has been handling the situation with great professionalism, ensuring that we are well-informed and comfortable despite the circumstances.""

The Maldives, an archipelago renowned for its exclusive resorts and vibrant marine life, relies heavily on tourism, contributing to a significant portion of its GDP. The sudden outbreak poses a potential threat to the industry, with the government swiftly implementing measures to curb the spread and reassure future visitors.

The Maldivian Ministry of Health has dispatched a team of medical professionals to Kuredu Island. They are conducting tests and monitoring the health of those in quarantine, while also providing necessary medical care. The ministry has reassured that strict protocols are in place to prevent further transmission of the virus.

Guests at the resort have been confined to their rooms, receiving meals and amenities delivered directly to their doors. ""The staff is doing their best to keep us comfortable,"" noted John Harris, a British tourist. ""It's not the vacation we planned, but we're safe and that's what matters.""

The resort management has maintained open lines of communication with its guests, providing regular updates on the situation. They have also implemented additional sanitation procedures and are working closely with health authorities to facilitate the safe return of guests once the quarantine period concludes.

Travel advisories have been updated in light of the recent developments. The Maldivian government has imposed travel restrictions for certain countries, urging travelers to exercise caution and adhere to health guidelines. Meanwhile, airlines are coordinating with authorities to manage the logistics of returning quarantined tourists to their home countries once clearance is granted.

In the meantime, the unexpected quarantine is offering guests a unique opportunity to bond, albeit from a distance. Social media groups have sprung up among those in isolation, with tourists sharing their experiences and supporting each other through this unusual ordeal. ""We've connected with people from all over the world,"" said Maria Gonzalez from Spain. ""It's a strange situation, but we're making the best of it.""

The Kuredu Island incident underscores the challenges faced by the global tourism industry as it grapples with the far-reaching impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Resorts and hotels worldwide are reevaluating their health and safety protocols, emphasizing the need for preparedness and swift response in the face of such crises.

As the situation unfolds, the Maldives continues to monitor and adjust its approach to managing the pandemic's effects on tourism. Authorities remain hopeful that the swift and decisive measures taken will mitigate the outbreak and restore confidence among travelers.

For the tourists under quarantine at Kuredu Island, the experience is a stark reminder of the unpredictability of travel in the current climate. Yet, as they await the all-clear to return home, many express a shared sense of gratitude for the tireless efforts of the resort staff and health workers ensuring their well-being.

With the global focus on managing the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospitality industry is being tested like never before. The Kuredu Island quarantine serves as a case study in crisis management, highlighting the importance of communication, cooperation, and compassion in navigating the challenges posed by an unprecedented global health emergency.",gpt

“It’s unimaginable that something so horrific could happen in a place where my mother was supposed to be safe,” Emily said during an emotional interview. “We entrusted the nursing home with her care, and they failed her in the worst possible way.”

The incident reportedly occurred late one night when the facility was short-staffed, a situation that has become increasingly common due to widespread staffing shortages in the healthcare sector. According to Emily, her mother was found in a distressed state by a morning shift nurse, who immediately raised the alarm.

Local law enforcement is currently investigating the case, and a suspect, identified as a temporary staff member who was employed through an agency, has been arrested. The suspect, whose name has not been released, was not subject to the same rigorous background checks as permanent staff, raising concerns about the hiring practices of temporary workers in sensitive environments like nursing homes.

“We are conducting a thorough investigation to ensure justice is served,” said Detective Sarah Collins, the lead investigator on the case. “Our priority is to support the victim and her family during this difficult time and to ensure that such an atrocity never happens again.”

The management at Green Meadows has expressed their deepest apologies to the family and has promised to cooperate fully with the investigation. In a statement released to the press, the facility’s spokesperson, Robert Jenkins, said, “We are devastated by this incident and are reviewing our policies and hiring practices to prevent any future occurrences. Our thoughts are with the victim and her family.”

This incident has sparked outrage among advocacy groups for the elderly, who have long warned about the risks of understaffing and inadequate oversight in nursing homes. “This is a tragic reminder of what can happen when profit is prioritized over people,” said Linda Barrett, director of the Elder Rights Coalition. “We need stricter regulations and more comprehensive checks to protect our seniors.”

Data from the National Center on Elder Abuse suggests that sexual abuse, while less common than other forms of elder abuse, is a significant concern in care facilities. The incident at Green Meadows has reignited calls for reform, with activists urging lawmakers to implement stricter oversight and more robust reporting mechanisms for incidents of abuse.

Emily Thompson, meanwhile, has become an unexpected advocate for change. “I never thought I’d be in this position, but I refuse to let my mother’s suffering be in vain,” she said. “Our elderly deserve dignity and respect. We need to fix this broken system before more people get hurt.”

In the wake of this tragedy, Emily has started a petition calling for mandatory background checks for all nursing home employees and increased funding for elder care oversight. The petition has already garnered thousands of signatures, reflecting a growing public demand for change.

As the investigation continues, the Thompson family is focusing on supporting their mother’s recovery. “She’s a strong woman, and we’re doing everything we can to help her heal,” Emily said. “But this should never have happened in the first place.”

The case has cast a spotlight on the vulnerabilities within the elder care system, prompting many to hope that this tragic incident will lead to meaningful change. As public awareness grows, so too does the resolve of those determined to ensure that all elderly individuals can live their lives with the respect and safety they deserve.",gpt
NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners,"In an unprecedented move, the National Basketball Association (NBA) announced the suspension of its 2023-2024 season, a decision that has sent shockwaves through the sports community and delivered a significant blow to its broadcasting partners. The decision, driven by unforeseen circumstances, leaves networks grappling with the implications of losing one of their most lucrative programming assets.

The NBA's broadcasting partners, including ESPN, Turner Sports, and various regional sports networks, stand at the forefront of this crisis. The suspension not only disrupts their programming schedules but also poses substantial financial challenges. With the NBA season being a cornerstone of their sports lineup, networks face the daunting task of filling airtime while managing the financial fallout from lost advertising revenues.

Television ratings for NBA games have been a vital metric, consistently delivering millions of viewers and contributing significantly to the networks' annual revenue. The NBA's popularity, both domestically and internationally, has been a driving force behind lucrative broadcasting deals. For instance, the current agreement, which runs through the 2024-2025 season, is valued at $24 billion, underscoring the league's importance to its media partners.

The ripple effects of the suspension are multifaceted. Advertisers, who have invested heavily in securing prime-time ad slots during NBA broadcasts, are now left in a precarious position. Companies that had aligned their marketing strategies with the NBA's calendar must now pivot, seeking alternative avenues to reach their target audiences. This shift may lead to strained relationships between networks and advertisers, as both parties navigate the uncertainty and attempt to renegotiate terms in light of the season's hiatus.

In response to the suspension, networks are exploring a range of contingency plans to mitigate the impact. These include airing classic NBA games, expanding coverage of other sports, and enhancing their slate of original programming. However, these measures may only partially offset the loss, as nothing quite matches the live spectacle and audience engagement that NBA games provide.

Moreover, the suspension comes at a time when the competition for viewership is fiercer than ever. Streaming platforms have increasingly encroached on traditional television's domain, offering sports fans a plethora of options beyond cable and satellite. This shift in viewing habits further complicates the situation for networks, which must now strategize to retain their audience amid the absence of live NBA content.

Industry experts suggest that the suspension could accelerate the networks' ongoing transition towards digital platforms. With the traditional broadcasting model under strain, networks may invest more heavily in streaming services and digital content to capture the younger, tech-savvy demographic that is less reliant on cable subscriptions. This shift could have long-term implications for how sports, including the NBA, are consumed in the future.

The suspension also casts a shadow over the NBA's international broadcasting deals. The league's global fan base has been a significant driver of its growth, with games broadcast in over 200 countries. Networks around the world now face similar challenges, as they, too, must adapt to the sudden void in their sports programming.

As the NBA and its partners navigate this challenging landscape, fans are left in anticipation, eager for updates on the league's plans to resume play. While the suspension is undoubtedly a setback, it also presents an opportunity for the NBA and its media partners to innovate and evolve in response to the changing dynamics of sports broadcasting.

In the interim, networks will need to leverage their creativity and strategic planning to maintain viewer engagement and financial stability. The coming months will be a test of resilience and adaptability for the NBA's TV partners, as they work to overcome the hurdles posed by the season's suspension.

Ultimately, the suspension of the NBA season is a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of the sports and media industries. The decision has reverberated beyond the court, impacting a vast ecosystem of stakeholders. As the situation unfolds, all eyes will be on how the league and its partners chart a path forward, ensuring that the NBA's return is as impactful as ever for fans and broadcasters alike.",gpt
Meet the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year,"In a world where acts of kindness often go unnoticed, one individual has risen to the forefront of humanitarian efforts, capturing the hearts and minds of people across the globe. Rina Patel, a dedicated philanthropist and social entrepreneur, has been named the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year for her transformative work in empowering underprivileged communities through education and sustainable development.

Rina Patel, originally from a small village in Gujarat, India, moved to the United States for her college education. Her journey from a modest upbringing to becoming a beacon of hope for many is nothing short of inspiring. After completing her studies at Harvard University, Rina could have easily pursued a lucrative career in the corporate world. Instead, she chose a path less traveled, dedicating her life to service and upliftment.

In 2010, Rina founded ""EmpowerEd,"" a non-profit organization aimed at providing quality education to children in remote areas of India. What began as a small initiative with just a handful of volunteers has grown into a formidable force for change, impacting over 50,000 children across 200 villages. EmpowerEd focuses on creating an engaging and inclusive educational environment, training local teachers, and providing necessary resources and infrastructure.

Rina's approach is holistic, addressing not just the educational needs of the children but also the socio-economic challenges faced by their families. EmpowerEd's programs include vocational training for adults, health and hygiene workshops, and initiatives to promote gender equality. ""Education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty,"" Rina often says. ""By empowering children and their families, we can create a ripple effect that transforms entire communities.""

The impact of EmpowerEd has been profound, leading to increased school enrollment rates, reduced dropout rates, and improved academic performance among the children. Parents who were once skeptical of the benefits of education have become ardent supporters, witnessing firsthand the positive changes in their children's lives.

CNN's recognition of Rina Patel as the Hero of the Year highlights not only her remarkable achievements but also the power of grassroots initiatives in driving sustainable change. The award ceremony, held in New York City, was a star-studded event with celebrities and dignitaries from around the world in attendance. As Rina took the stage to accept her award, the audience erupted in applause, acknowledging her tireless dedication and selfless spirit.

In her acceptance speech, Rina shared a poignant story of a young girl named Meera, who was among the first students at an EmpowerEd school. Meera's father, a farmer, initially resisted the idea of sending his daughter to school, believing her place was at home. However, with persistence and support from EmpowerEd, Meera not only completed her education but went on to become the first female engineer from her village. ""Meera's story is just one of many,"" Rina said, her voice filled with emotion. ""It is a testament to what can be achieved when we invest in our children and believe in their potential.""

The recognition comes with a $100,000 grant to further Rina's work, enabling her to expand EmpowerEd's reach and impact even more lives. Rina has plans to launch a new initiative focused on digital literacy, equipping children and adults with the skills needed to thrive in today's technology-driven world. ""The future is digital,"" Rina noted. ""Our goal is to ensure that no child is left behind in this digital revolution.""

Rina Patel's story is a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have in making the world a better place. Her journey from a small village in India to the global stage is a testament to the power of passion, perseverance, and purpose. As the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year, Rina hopes to inspire others to take action, emphasizing that ""every small effort counts, and together, we can create a brighter future for all.""",gpt
Nigeria says it is ready and more than capable of dealing with coronavirus,"Nigeria has declared itself ready and more than capable of handling the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, as government officials and health authorities ramp up efforts to prevent the spread of the virus within its borders. In a recent press conference, Nigeria's Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, emphasized that the country is prepared to implement effective measures to safeguard the health of its citizens.

Dr. Ehanire assured Nigerians that the government is taking proactive steps to strengthen the country's healthcare system and enhance its response capabilities. ""We have been monitoring the situation closely and have put in place a comprehensive plan to deal with any potential cases of coronavirus,"" he said. ""Our health institutions are equipped, and our personnel are trained to manage and contain any outbreak.""

The Nigerian government has activated its emergency operations center and is working in close collaboration with international partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). This collaboration aims to ensure that Nigeria receives timely information and support in dealing with the evolving situation.

To bolster its readiness, Nigeria has implemented strict screening measures at its airports and other points of entry. Passengers arriving from countries with high infection rates are being screened thoroughly, and health declaration forms are being collected to track any potential cases. The government has also advised citizens to avoid non-essential travel to affected regions.

In addition to these measures, the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has been at the forefront of the country's response efforts. The NCDC has established a network of laboratories across the country capable of testing for the coronavirus, ensuring that suspected cases can be quickly identified and isolated. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, the Director-General of the NCDC, emphasized the importance of early detection in preventing the spread of the virus. ""Detecting cases early is crucial, and we have the infrastructure in place to do so,"" he stated.

Public awareness campaigns have been launched to educate the populace on preventive measures, such as regular handwashing, respiratory hygiene, and social distancing. The government is also working with community leaders and influencers to disseminate accurate information and dispel myths surrounding the virus.

Despite these preparations, the Nigerian government acknowledges the challenges posed by the country's dense population and the strain on its healthcare system. Dr. Ehanire highlighted the importance of community cooperation and vigilance in combating the virus. ""We urge all Nigerians to be mindful of their health and to adhere to the guidelines issued by health authorities,"" he said.

The private sector has also stepped in to support the government's efforts, with several companies donating medical supplies and equipment to health facilities across the country. These contributions are seen as essential in bolstering Nigeria's capacity to manage any potential outbreak.

As Nigeria positions itself as a leader in the African continent's response to the coronavirus, regional cooperation is also being prioritized. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has been actively coordinating with member states to develop a unified approach to combat the virus. Nigeria, as one of the largest and most populous countries in the region, is playing a pivotal role in shaping this response.

While the situation remains fluid, the Nigerian government remains optimistic about its ability to handle the coronavirus threat. However, officials continue to stress the need for vigilance and preparedness. ""We are confident in our ability to manage this situation, but we cannot afford to be complacent,"" Dr. Ehanire warned.

As the world watches, Nigeria stands at a critical juncture in its fight against the coronavirus. With a robust plan in place and a commitment to safeguarding public health, the country aims to emerge from this global crisis stronger and more resilient.",gpt
Donald Trump brings out the worst in people,"In recent years, former President Donald Trump has been a polarizing figure in American politics, and his influence continues to evoke strong reactions from individuals across the political spectrum. From fervent supporters to vehement detractors, Trump has an undeniable ability to bring out the extremes in people, prompting many to question the underlying causes of this phenomenon.

Trump's political style, characterized by his unfiltered rhetoric and confrontational approach, has often served as a catalyst for heightened emotions. His rallies, for example, have become infamous for the fervor they incite among attendees. Supporters are often seen chanting slogans with unrestrained enthusiasm, while protestors outside frequently clash with crowds, leading to chaotic scenes. This environment, charged with emotion and division, underscores how Trump's presence can amplify existing tensions.

One factor contributing to this dynamic is Trump's skillful use of social media, which he has weaponized to communicate directly with the public. Through platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Trump bypasses traditional media outlets, often delivering incendiary messages that quickly capture attention. His posts frequently spark outrage, leading to widespread debates and discussions that polarize social media users. This digital arena, where emotions run high and anonymity can fuel hostility, becomes a fertile ground for people to express their most extreme views.

Moreover, Trump's rhetoric often touches on deeply rooted issues within American society, such as immigration, race, and national identity. By addressing these contentious topics in a manner that some perceive as divisive, he stirs passions on both sides of the aisle. His comments on immigration, for example, have drawn criticism from those who view them as xenophobic, while simultaneously galvanizing supporters who see him as a champion for stricter border controls. This dual impact reflects how Trump's words can elicit strong, often opposing, reactions.

The former president's influence extends beyond his core base, impacting the broader political landscape. Many Republican politicians have adopted similar rhetorical strategies, emulating Trump's bombastic style to rally their own supporters. This emulation has further entrenched divisions within the GOP, as some members align themselves closely with Trump's ideology, while others distance themselves in an effort to appeal to a more moderate electorate. The result is a party that appears increasingly fractured, with internal conflicts often playing out in the public eye.

On the other hand, Trump's presence also galvanizes his opposition. Progressive movements have gained momentum, with many citing his presidency as a catalyst for increased activism. From the Women's March to the Black Lives Matter protests, Trump's policies and statements have often served as motivation for those advocating for social justice and equality. This opposition is not limited to grassroots movements; Democratic politicians frequently leverage anti-Trump sentiment to mobilize their base, framing upcoming elections as a referendum on his legacy.

However, the phenomenon of Trump bringing out the worst in people is not solely a political issue. Psychologists suggest that his influence taps into deeper psychological processes. Trump's ability to evoke strong emotional responses can be attributed to a concept known as ""emotional contagion,"" where people mimic the emotions of those they are exposed to, especially when those emotions are intense. His speeches, laden with emotional appeals and dramatic language, can therefore lead individuals to react passionately, often without careful consideration of the nuances involved.

As Trump remains a central figure in American politics, the question of how he brings out the worst in people continues to be a subject of analysis and debate. While some argue that his approach highlights pre-existing divisions, others contend that it exacerbates them, creating an environment where extreme views flourish. What is clear is that Trump's influence is pervasive, shaping not only political discourse but also societal interactions in a manner that highlights both the best and the worst of human nature.

As the nation grapples with the aftermath of his presidency and his ongoing influence, the challenge remains: how to navigate a political climate where emotions often overshadow reason, and where the extremes of human behavior are increasingly brought to the forefront. The answers will likely shape the future of American politics and society for years to come.",gpt
Our connected world made coronavirus spread. It may also be what saves us from it,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to challenge the global community, there is an undeniable irony in how our interconnected world has both fueled the spread of the virus and may ultimately hold the key to overcoming it. The COVID-19 outbreak, which began in Wuhan, China, rapidly transcended borders, aided by the very technologies and global networks that define the 21st century. However, it is these same connections that are playing a crucial role in the global response to the pandemic, offering hope for a solution.

The rapid dissemination of COVID-19 across the globe is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in our interconnected world. International travel, trade, and migration, once celebrated as symbols of globalization, have facilitated the virus's swift journey from one continent to another. Airports, cruise ships, and densely populated urban centers became hotspots, illustrating how closely knit our world truly is. In a matter of weeks, what was initially a local outbreak in a Chinese city became a global crisis, affecting millions and reshaping daily life for billions more.

Yet, while our connectedness has undeniably contributed to the virus's proliferation, it also provides a robust framework for combating it. The same networks that enabled the virus to spread are now being leveraged to share information, resources, and strategies in real time. International cooperation has become a cornerstone of the global response, with countries sharing data on infection rates, treatment protocols, and vaccine research.

Digital technology, a hallmark of our interconnected age, has emerged as a powerful ally in the fight against COVID-19. Health organizations and governments worldwide are utilizing digital platforms to disseminate vital public health information, ensure compliance with safety guidelines, and track the virus's spread. Contact tracing apps, although sometimes controversial, have been instrumental in identifying and isolating cases to prevent further transmission.

Moreover, the internet has facilitated unprecedented levels of scientific collaboration. Researchers from across the globe are working together virtually, sharing findings and accelerating the development of potential vaccines and treatments. Initiatives like the World Health Organization's Solidarity Trial exemplify how international collaboration can speed up clinical trials and streamline the testing process for new therapeutics.

Social media, despite its pitfalls, has also played a significant role in the pandemic response. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have been used to share critical information, counter misinformation, and provide support networks during lockdowns. In addition, these platforms have become essential tools for organizing community support, from coordinating food deliveries for vulnerable individuals to raising funds for frontline workers.

The economic impact of the pandemic has been profound, yet here too, our interconnected world offers pathways to resilience. Global supply chains have been tested like never before, but they are also adapting, with companies and countries working to ensure the continued flow of essential goods and medical supplies. The pandemic has spurred innovation in logistics and manufacturing, with industries rapidly pivoting to produce personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other critical medical supplies.

Education, another pillar of society, has also seen a transformative shift. With schools and universities around the world forced to close their doors, online learning platforms have become indispensable. This transition has highlighted disparities in access to technology, but it has also driven efforts to bridge the digital divide, ensuring that education remains accessible even in times of crisis.

As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's challenges, the lessons learned from our interconnected existence are becoming increasingly clear. While globalization and technological advancements have facilitated the virus's spread, they are also integral to our response and recovery efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of international cooperation, digital innovation, and community solidarity.

In this dual role of both villain and hero, our connected world is a testament to humanity's capacity for resilience and adaptation. As we navigate this unprecedented crisis, it is our shared networks, knowledge, and determination that may ultimately guide us toward a safer, healthier future. In a world where borders are increasingly porous, the fight against COVID-19 is a reminder that in unity lies our greatest strength.",gpt
Have Your Say,"In the bustling world of digital democracy, more people than ever are finding their voices amplified through online platforms. As the internet reshapes public discourse, our new series, ""Have Your Say,"" seeks to explore the power dynamics, challenges, and opportunities that come with this shift. 

In recent years, social media and online forums have become the new public square, where debates on everything from local governance to global crises unfold. Traditional gatekeepers of information, such as newspapers and broadcasters, are no longer the sole arbiters of public opinion. Instead, individuals now have the unprecedented ability to reach wide audiences, sharing their insights and sometimes sparking significant change.

Take the example of Greta Thunberg, the teenage activist who leveraged Twitter to catapult her climate strike movement into a global phenomenon. Her story is a testament to the democratizing potential of the internet, demonstrating how one voice can resonate worldwide. But with this potential comes responsibility and, indeed, a slew of challenges.

One of the most pressing issues is the spread of misinformation. With platforms like Facebook and Twitter under scrutiny for their role in disseminating false information, the question arises: How can we ensure that the voices being amplified are credible and constructive? Companies are investing heavily in AI and fact-checking teams to combat this issue, but the sheer volume of content makes it a herculean task.

Moreover, the rise of online discourse has also seen the unfortunate proliferation of hate speech and trolling. For many, participating in online discussions can be daunting, with the risk of encountering vitriol and harassment. This environment can stifle voices, particularly those from marginalized communities who may already feel vulnerable. As a result, platforms are grappling with the challenge of balancing free speech with the need to protect users from harmful content.

Despite these challenges, the benefits of having a say in the digital age are significant. Online platforms have made it easier for people to connect over shared interests and causes, fostering a sense of community and solidarity. Campaigns like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter have shown the power of collective voices in highlighting systemic issues and driving social change. These movements, born online, have transcended digital boundaries to effect tangible change in the real world.

Governments and policymakers are taking note of this shift. Many have begun to engage with citizens through digital town halls and social media interactions, recognizing the importance of being in tune with the public pulse. Yet, this engagement is not without its pitfalls. The risk of populism and echo chambers looms large, with algorithms often curating content that reinforces existing beliefs rather than challenging them.

For individuals looking to make their voices heard, the key lies in navigating this complex landscape wisely. Engaging critically with information, seeking diverse perspectives, and maintaining civility in discussions are essential for meaningful participation. Educational initiatives aimed at improving digital literacy are also crucial, equipping people with the skills needed to discern credible sources and engage constructively.

As we continue to explore the theme of ""Have Your Say,"" we invite readers to reflect on their own experiences in the digital realm. How has the ability to voice your opinion online impacted your life, and what changes would you like to see in this evolving space? Your thoughts and experiences are invaluable as we delve deeper into this modern frontier of expression.

In closing, the digital age offers a remarkable opportunity for individuals to engage with the world around them in ways previously unimaginable. However, realizing the full potential of this opportunity requires a concerted effort from individuals, platforms, and policymakers alike to foster an environment where all voices can be heard, respected, and valued. As we navigate this new era of public discourse, let us strive to cultivate a digital landscape that reflects the best of our democratic ideals.",gpt
Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"Brazil's fashion industry, known for its vibrant colors and bold designs, is facing increasing scrutiny over a lack of diversity. Despite the country's rich cultural tapestry and a population that is one of the most ethnically diverse in the world, the fashion sector remains largely unrepresentative of Brazil's demographic makeup. Critics argue that this disparity not only limits the industry's creative potential but also perpetuates systemic inequalities.

The issue was thrust into the spotlight during São Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), Latin America's most prominent fashion event, where the underrepresentation of Black and Indigenous models on the runway was glaringly apparent. According to a report by the Fashion Revolution Brasil, an advocacy group promoting transparency and inclusivity in the fashion supply chain, only 25% of the models at SPFW were non-white in a country where over 50% of the population identifies as Black or mixed race.

Activists and industry insiders are calling for immediate action to address this imbalance. ""Brazil's fashion industry has long ignored the cultural and racial diversity that makes this country unique,"" says Flávia Santos, a prominent fashion critic and advocate for racial equality. ""It's time for real, systemic change that goes beyond tokenism and embraces diversity at all levels—from the runway to the boardroom.""

The roots of the problem run deep. Historically, the Brazilian fashion world has been dominated by European standards of beauty, which favor lighter skin and Western features. This bias is evident not only in model selection but also in the hiring practices within fashion houses and the types of narratives that are celebrated and promoted. Many industry leaders have been slow to embrace change, citing market demands and consumer preferences as justifications for maintaining the status quo.

Yet, the market is shifting. A growing number of consumers are demanding representation and authenticity in the brands they support. Social media platforms have amplified these voices, facilitating grassroots movements that are challenging the industry's norms. Influential figures in the fashion world, such as designer Isaac Silva, are using their platforms to highlight the contributions of Black and Indigenous communities to fashion and culture. Silva, known for his inclusive runway shows, argues that diversity is not just a moral imperative but also a business opportunity. ""Inclusion can drive creativity and innovation,"" he asserts. ""Brands that embrace diversity are more likely to resonate with a wider audience and succeed in a global market.""

Some brands are beginning to heed the call. Major fashion houses like Osklen and Farm Rio have made public commitments to improve diversity within their ranks and on their runways. They are implementing initiatives such as diversity training programs and partnerships with organizations that promote racial and cultural inclusion. However, critics argue that these efforts are often superficial and lack the depth needed to drive lasting change.

The Brazilian government and industry regulators are also being urged to take action. Proposals include implementing policies that incentivize diversity and penalize discrimination in hiring practices. ""Government intervention can set standards and create accountability,"" says Mariana Oliveira, a legal analyst specializing in employment law. ""It's necessary to ensure that diversity becomes a foundational aspect of the industry, rather than a passing trend.""

For true progress to be made, experts emphasize the need for a multi-faceted approach. This involves not only increasing representation on the runway but also fostering an inclusive culture behind the scenes. Educational programs that nurture diverse talent and promote cultural awareness are seen as crucial steps in dismantling the barriers that have long hindered underrepresented groups from entering and succeeding in the fashion industry.

As the conversation around diversity in Brazil's fashion industry continues to evolve, stakeholders are being challenged to reflect on the broader implications of their practices. The movement towards greater inclusivity is not just about representation in fashion; it is a reflection of a nation striving to reconcile its identity with its aspirations for equity and justice. The fashion industry, as a cultural bellwether, has a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to lead the way in this transformative journey.",gpt
"Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts","Generational labels have become a staple in modern discourse, shaping everything from marketing strategies to political campaigns. Yet, the exact boundaries that define each generation are often subjects of debate. Here, we delve into the facts to demystify when each generation begins and ends, based on research and expert insights.

**The Silent Generation: 1928-1945**

Beginning with the Silent Generation, we find a group born between 1928 and 1945. This cohort is characterized by their formative years during the Great Depression and World War II, experiences that instilled values of hard work, discipline, and modesty. The label ""Silent"" suggests their perceived inclination towards conformism and caution in the face of the political and social upheavals of their time.

**Baby Boomers: 1946-1964**

Following the Silent Generation, the Baby Boomers were born in the post-World War II era, from 1946 to 1964. This generation witnessed unprecedented economic growth and prosperity. The name ""Boomers"" itself reflects the significant increase in birth rates during this period. Baby Boomers played pivotal roles in the Civil Rights Movement and the countercultural revolution of the 1960s, and they continue to influence culture and politics today.

**Generation X: 1965-1980**

Generation X, also known as the ""latchkey generation,"" was born between 1965 and 1980. These individuals grew up during a time of shifting societal norms, including higher divorce rates and increased maternal employment. As a result, Gen Xers are often viewed as independent, resourceful, and skeptical. They were the first generation to grow up with personal computers, giving them a unique perspective on the rapid technological advancements that followed.

**Millennials (Generation Y): 1981-1996**

Millennials, or Generation Y, encompass those born from 1981 to 1996. This generation came of age during the turn of the millennium and is noted for its familiarity with the internet, mobile devices, and social media. Growing up in an era of dramatic technological and economic change, Millennials often value flexibility, purpose, and work-life balance. They are recognized for their adaptability and are credited with driving significant cultural and technological shifts.

**Generation Z: 1997-2012**

The successors of Millennials, Generation Z, were born between 1997 and 2012. This cohort is often referred to as ""digital natives,"" having never known a world without the internet. Gen Z is characterized by their adeptness with technology and their emphasis on individuality and inclusivity. They are coming of age in a world grappling with climate change, political polarization, and social justice movements, which heavily influence their outlook and activism.

**Generation Alpha: 2013-Present**

Finally, Generation Alpha represents those born from 2013 onward. This generation is still in their formative years, but they are expected to be the most technologically immersed yet. Raised by predominantly Millennial parents, Generation Alpha is growing up in an increasingly digital and globalized world. While it is too early to fully define their characteristics, early observations suggest a continued trend towards technological integration in all aspects of life.

**Debates and Considerations**

While these generational boundaries are widely recognized, it is important to note the fluidity and ongoing debate surrounding them. Generational labels are not universally agreed upon, and some experts argue that the delineations should be more flexible to account for cultural and regional differences. Additionally, the impact of external events, such as economic recessions or pandemics, can influence the defining characteristics of a generation, further complicating precise definitions.

Despite these debates, understanding generational boundaries can provide valuable insights into societal trends, consumer behavior, and intergenerational dynamics. By recognizing the experiences that shape each generation, we gain a deeper appreciation for how they contribute to the cultural mosaic of our world.

In conclusion, while the boundaries of each generation are not set in stone, the generally accepted time frames offer a useful framework for understanding the broad characteristics and influences that define each group. As society continues to evolve, so too will our understanding of generational dynamics, ensuring that these labels remain relevant in an ever-changing world.",gpt
BBC News,"In a significant development that underscores the rapidly evolving landscape of global media, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) announced today a series of strategic changes aimed at reinforcing its commitment to independent journalism while embracing technological advancements. As the digital media environment continues to shift, the BBC is positioning itself to better serve audiences worldwide in an era marked by increased competition and the proliferation of misinformation.

At the heart of these changes is a renewed focus on digital-first content, a move that reflects the growing importance of online platforms in reaching diverse and younger audiences. The BBC plans to enhance its digital offerings by investing in new technology and expanding its presence on social media. This strategy includes the rollout of an advanced version of the BBC News app, which will feature personalized content recommendations and quicker access to breaking news.

Director-General Tim Davie emphasized the importance of these changes in a statement released today. ""The BBC has always been at the forefront of broadcasting innovation. As we navigate a rapidly changing world, we must ensure that our journalism remains accessible, trusted, and relevant to all audiences,"" Davie said. ""Our commitment to impartiality and accuracy remains unwavering, and by leveraging new technologies, we can deliver our content more effectively than ever before.""

Part of the BBC's strategic overhaul involves restructuring its newsroom to better integrate digital and traditional broadcasting operations. This approach is expected to foster greater collaboration between various departments, enabling the BBC to produce more dynamic and cohesive content across its platforms. The restructuring will also see a focus on investigative journalism, with resources allocated to uncovering underreported stories and tackling misinformation head-on.

In addition to internal changes, the BBC is set to expand its partnerships with other media organizations and technology companies. By collaborating with digital giants, the BBC aims to broaden its reach and enhance its ability to deliver high-quality journalism to a global audience. These partnerships are expected to include co-production agreements, content-sharing initiatives, and joint ventures that leverage emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.

The BBC's strategic pivot comes at a time when the media industry is facing unprecedented challenges. The rise of social media has democratized information dissemination, blurring the lines between professional journalism and amateur content creation. This shift has led to increased scrutiny on traditional news outlets, as they strive to maintain credibility in an environment where misinformation can spread rapidly.

Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos,"Japanese tattoos, known as ""irezumi,"" are more than mere body art; they are a rich tapestry of history and symbolism embedded deeply within Japanese culture. With their intricate designs and vibrant colors, these tattoos are a visual language that speaks volumes about the individual who wears them and the society from which they originate. But what do these elaborate designs truly represent?

Irezumi has a storied history, dating back to Japan’s Edo period (1603-1868), when tattoos were used both as punishment and as a symbol of status and identity. The art form evolved over centuries, influenced by ukiyo-e woodblock prints and traditional Japanese mythology. Today, despite a lingering stigma associated with organized crime, irezumi is increasingly recognized as a cultural and artistic expression.

One of the most recognizable motifs in irezumi is the koi fish. In Japanese culture, the koi symbolizes perseverance and strength. According to legend, a koi swims upstream against the current, and if it successfully reaches the top of a waterfall, it transforms into a powerful dragon. This transformation is emblematic of the wearer’s own journey and personal growth, making it a popular choice for those who have overcome significant challenges.

Another prevalent image in Japanese tattoos is the dragon. Unlike the fearsome dragons of Western folklore, the Japanese dragon is seen as a benevolent creature, a guardian that embodies wisdom and strength. It is a symbol of protection and good fortune, often depicted twisting and turning across the skin with dynamic energy.

The cherry blossom, or sakura, is also a common element in irezumi, representing the fleeting nature of life. Cherry blossoms bloom for only a short time each spring, reminding the wearer of the beauty and transience of existence. This motif often accompanies other symbols, adding layers of meaning to the tattoo.

Tigers, too, hold a prominent place in the world of Japanese tattoos. They are symbols of courage and protection, believed to ward off evil spirits and bad luck. Often portrayed in dynamic poses, the tiger embodies fierce power and strength, making it an ideal motif for those seeking to convey these qualities.

The phoenix, another mythical creature, symbolizes rebirth and renewal. Emerging from its ashes, the phoenix represents the cyclical nature of life and the opportunity for transformation and new beginnings. As a tattoo, it reflects the wearer’s resilience and ability to rise from adversity.

It is important to note the cultural significance and respect that irezumi commands. Traditionally, Japanese tattoo artists, or horishi, undergo years of rigorous apprenticeship, mastering the unique techniques that set irezumi apart from other forms of tattooing. The process is painstaking, often performed by hand using non-electrical tools, a method known as tebori. This dedication to craft ensures that each tattoo is not only a personal statement but also a work of art.

Despite the artistry involved, irezumi has historically carried a social stigma in Japan, largely due to its association with the yakuza, or Japanese organized crime syndicates. Members of the yakuza are known for their full-body tattoos, which serve as symbols of loyalty and commitment to their organization. This connection has led to widespread discrimination, with many public places in Japan, such as bathhouses and gyms, prohibiting individuals with visible tattoos.

However, attitudes toward tattoos in Japan are gradually shifting. As international perspectives on tattoos become more accepting, and as Japanese society becomes more exposed to global cultures, the perception of irezumi is evolving. Younger generations are increasingly embracing tattoos as a form of personal expression, distancing themselves from the negative connotations of the past.

In recent years, Japanese tattoos have gained popularity worldwide, admired for their aesthetic appeal and profound symbolism. Tattoo conventions and exhibitions frequently feature irezumi artists, showcasing the beauty and depth of this traditional art form.

Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos reveals a complex interplay of personal narrative and cultural heritage. Whether as a symbol of strength, protection, renewal, or the ephemeral nature of life, each tattoo tells a story that transcends ink and skin. As irezumi continues to evolve, it remains a testament to the enduring power of art and tradition in shaping identity and expressing individuality.",gpt
Satellite images show Iran building burial pits for coronavirus victims,"Satellite images have revealed disturbing developments in Iran, as the country grapples with the severe impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The images, captured by commercial satellite company Maxar Technologies, reveal the construction of extensive burial pits at the Behesht-e Masoumeh cemetery near the city of Qom, one of the epicenters of the outbreak in the country.

The pictures, taken in late February, show two large trenches, each approximately 100 yards in length, that appear to have been rapidly excavated. These burial sites are believed to be intended for coronavirus victims, amid concerns over the Iranian government’s transparency and handling of the crisis. Analysts reviewing the satellite images note that the rapid expansion of burial facilities indicates that the number of fatalities may be higher than what has been officially reported.

Iran has been one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus outside of China, where the virus originated. As of this writing, Iranian authorities have reported over 10,000 confirmed cases and more than 400 deaths. However, skepticism about the accuracy of these figures persists, fueled by reports from health workers and citizens on the ground, who suggest that the real numbers could be significantly higher.

The construction of these burial pits aligns with anecdotal evidence and reports of overwhelmed hospitals and shortages of medical supplies across the country. Videos circulating on social media purportedly show chaotic scenes in hospitals, with patients lying on floors and hallways due to a lack of available beds. Health workers have voiced concerns about inadequate protective gear, which puts them at risk as they battle to contain the outbreak.

Qom, a city of religious significance and a major pilgrimage site, was the first in Iran to report coronavirus cases. The city’s status as a hub for travelers and pilgrims may have contributed to the rapid spread of the virus both within Iran and to neighboring countries. Authorities have faced criticism for their initial handling of the outbreak, including delays in quarantining affected areas and imposing travel restrictions.

The satellite images have prompted calls for greater transparency from the Iranian government. Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, has urged Iran to ""tell the truth"" about the coronavirus outbreak. Concerns have also been raised by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has sent teams to assist Iranian health officials in responding to the crisis.

In response to the growing pressure, Iran has taken steps to mitigate the spread of the virus. The government has closed schools and universities, canceled public events, and restricted travel between cities. Religious gatherings have also been limited, a significant move in a country where such gatherings are deeply woven into the social fabric.

Despite these measures, the Iranian people continue to face significant challenges. The combination of U.S. sanctions and the health crisis has strained the country’s economy, complicating efforts to import necessary medical supplies and equipment. The Iranian government has called for sanctions relief to aid its response to the pandemic, a plea echoed by human rights organizations and some international leaders.

As Iran struggles to contain the virus, the international community watches with concern. The situation in Iran serves as a stark reminder of the potential for COVID-19 to overwhelm national health systems, particularly in countries already facing economic and political challenges.

The satellite images of burial pits in Qom are a sobering illustration of the human toll of the pandemic. They underscore the urgency of coordinated global efforts to support affected nations and contain the spread of the virus. As the world battles this unprecedented health crisis, transparency and cooperation remain crucial in mitigating its impact and saving lives.

The developments in Iran offer a cautionary tale about the importance of early intervention and transparent communication in managing the coronavirus outbreak. As countries around the globe brace for the continued spread of COVID-19, the lessons learned from Iran’s experience may prove invaluable in shaping effective responses to the pandemic.",gpt
What it's like to be me,"In the heart of bustling New York City, where the skyline kisses the clouds and the sidewalks pulse with life, lies a narrative often overlooked but richly complex. It's a story of identity, resilience, and the quiet battles fought every day. This is what it's like to be me.

I navigate a world that constantly demands answers to questions I sometimes can't articulate myself. Born to immigrant parents, my existence is a tapestry woven with threads of two contrasting cultures. At home, my life is a symphony of languages, aromas, and traditions that root me to a different time and place. Outside, I'm an ordinary American, seamlessly blending into the mosaic of city life. This duality is both a privilege and a challenge, a dance of belonging and isolation.

Growing up, I often felt the weight of expectations pressing down on my shoulders. My parents, who sacrificed so much to give me a chance at a better life, instilled in me the value of hard work and perseverance. They carried stories of hardship, of distant lands and lost opportunities, and handed them to me as lessons. This heritage is a guiding star and a heavy mantle. It’s a reminder that my successes are not solely mine but part of a larger narrative of familial dreams and aspirations.

In the workplace, I am the embodiment of diversity initiatives and inclusion policies. I am the face of progress, yet I often find myself in rooms where I am the only one of my kind. My presence is a testament to change, but it comes with the burden of representation. I am often called upon to provide “the perspective,” to speak for a community as diverse as the people in it. It’s an honor and a responsibility, but sometimes, it's an exhausting endeavor to constantly educate and enlighten.

Socially, I am a bridge between worlds. My friends come from all walks of life, and they each see a piece of themselves in me. This interconnectedness is beautiful, yet it sometimes feels as though I'm a chameleon, adapting my hues to match my surroundings. There are days when I yearn for simplicity, for a world that doesn’t require so much adaptation, so much translation of self.

Being me means living with the quiet hum of anxiety that I might never fully belong anywhere. It means navigating microaggressions and stereotypes with grace, even when they cut deep. It's about finding solace in communities that understand the unspoken struggles, where a knowing nod or a shared laugh can bridge the gaps of misunderstanding.

There is, however, an undeniable strength in this existence. It's the resilience forged in the fires of adversity. It's the ability to see the world through a lens of empathy, understanding the struggles of others because they mirror my own. It's the pride in knowing that I am the culmination of generations of resilience and hope, a living testament to the dreams of those who came before me.

In quieter moments, I reflect on the beauty of my journey. I see the vibrant mosaic of experiences, languages, and cultures that form my identity. I cherish the ability to navigate multiple worlds, drawing strengths from each to forge a path that is uniquely mine. This journey, with all its complexities, is a testament to the richness of the human experience.

Being me means embracing the paradoxes of life, finding peace in the midst of chaos, and crafting an identity that transcends borders and boundaries. It's about writing my own narrative in a world that often tries to write it for me. It's about celebrating the beauty of diversity, not just in the world around me, but within myself.

In the end, what it's like to be me is a journey of self-discovery, a continuous unfolding of identity in a world that is constantly shifting. It’s a dance of cultures, a symphony of stories, and a testament to the enduring spirit of resilience. It's a reminder that while the world may never fully understand what it’s like to be me, there is power and beauty in the journey itself.",gpt
US politics,"In the latest turn of events in US politics, the ongoing debate over the federal budget has reached a critical juncture as lawmakers scramble to avert a government shutdown. With the deadline fast approaching, the halls of Congress have become a battleground for opposing ideologies, with both sides of the aisle firmly entrenched in their positions.

The primary sticking point in the negotiations remains the allocation of funds for key domestic programs and defense spending. Democrats, led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, are advocating for increased funding for social services, climate change initiatives, and health care. They argue that these investments are crucial for the nation's long-term prosperity and resilience. ""We must prioritize the needs of everyday Americans,"" Schumer emphasized in a recent press conference, ""and ensure that our budget reflects our values.""

On the other side, Republicans, spearheaded by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, are pushing for a budget that emphasizes fiscal responsibility and reduces what they see as excessive government spending. They are particularly focused on maintaining a robust defense budget, arguing that national security should not be compromised. ""Our duty is to protect American interests both at home and abroad,"" McConnell stated, ""and reckless spending will only jeopardize our future stability.""

The impasse has led to heightened tensions on Capitol Hill, as both parties have launched aggressive media campaigns to rally public support for their respective positions. This political standoff has also sparked concerns among economists and business leaders, who warn that a government shutdown could have significant repercussions for the US economy. With federal workers facing potential furloughs and government services at risk of suspension, the economic impact could be felt across multiple sectors.

President Joe Biden has been actively involved in the negotiations, seeking to broker a compromise that would satisfy both parties. In recent meetings with congressional leaders, Biden has emphasized the importance of bipartisanship and the need to find common ground. ""The American people expect us to work together,"" the President remarked. ""We need to put aside our differences and pass a budget that works for everyone.""

As the clock ticks down, the pressure is mounting on lawmakers to reach an agreement. Recent polls indicate that the American public is increasingly frustrated with the gridlock in Washington, with many expressing a desire for more collaborative governance. This sentiment has been echoed by several moderate lawmakers, who have called for a pragmatic approach to the budget talks.

In addition to the budget negotiations, other pressing issues are also shaping the current political landscape. Immigration reform, voting rights, and healthcare continue to dominate the national conversation, with advocacy groups and constituents urging lawmakers to take decisive action. These complex issues further complicate the legislative agenda, as Congress seeks to address multiple priorities within a limited timeframe.

Looking ahead, the outcome of the budget negotiations could have significant implications for the upcoming midterm elections. Both parties are acutely aware that their handling of this issue could sway voters and impact their prospects at the ballot box. As such, the stakes are high, and the pressure to deliver results is palpable.

In the meantime, citizens across the country remain on edge, anxious about the potential fallout from a government shutdown. As the nation awaits the outcome of these critical negotiations, the hope is that lawmakers will rise to the occasion and demonstrate a commitment to effective governance.

In this charged political climate, the coming days will be crucial in determining the direction of US politics. Whether a compromise can be reached and a shutdown averted remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the decisions made in the halls of Congress will resonate far beyond the confines of Capitol Hill, shaping the future of the nation and its people.",gpt
Leeds pupil 'sent home' for selling hand sanitiser,"Leeds, UK – A school in Leeds has found itself at the center of an unexpected controversy after a pupil was allegedly sent home for selling hand sanitiser to fellow students. The incident, which occurred earlier this week, has sparked a debate about entrepreneurial spirit versus school regulations.

The student, a 14-year-old at St. John's Secondary School, reportedly began selling small bottles of hand sanitiser to classmates amid heightened concerns over hygiene and illness. According to sources, the young entrepreneur set up his makeshift business during break times, offering the sanitiser at a price of £1 per 50ml bottle. With supply shortages affecting many local stores, the student's initiative quickly gained popularity among pupils keen to protect themselves during the ongoing cold and flu season.

However, the school's administration remained unimpressed by the student's business acumen. On Tuesday, the pupil was called into the headteacher's office and subsequently sent home for what the school described as ""unauthorised trading on school premises."" The decision has divided opinion among parents and students, with some praising the student's initiative while others support the school's enforcement of its rules.

In a statement released to the press, a spokesperson for St. John's Secondary School explained their position: ""While we commend the student's entrepreneurial spirit, we must also consider the safety and well-being of all students. The sale of items on school grounds is prohibited unless expressly authorised by the administration. This policy is in place to ensure that products distributed among students meet health and safety standards.""

The school further noted that students were already provided with hand sanitiser in classrooms and communal areas, making the sale unnecessary. ""We have taken measures to ensure that all students have access to hand sanitiser throughout the school day,"" the statement continued. ""There is no need for students to purchase their own supplies, especially on school grounds.""

Despite the school's stance, some parents have voiced their support for the young businessman. ""I think it's fantastic that he's showing initiative and business skills at such a young age,"" said Sarah McIntyre, whose daughter attends St. John's. ""Surely we should be encouraging our children to think outside the box and develop skills that will benefit them in the future.""

Others, however, remain concerned about the broader implications. ""I understand the school's position,"" said Mark Thompson, another parent. ""Allowing this kind of activity could lead to a lack of control over what products are being sold and their safety. It's a tricky situation, but rules are in place for a reason.""

The incident has also caught the attention of local business figures. Emily Carter, a Leeds-based entrepreneur and mentor for young business start-ups, weighed in on the situation. ""It's important to foster entrepreneurial skills in young people,"" she remarked. ""However, it's equally important to educate them about regulations and ethical considerations in business. This could be a valuable learning experience for the student involved, provided it's handled correctly.""

The pupil's family has not commented publicly on the matter, and it remains unclear whether the student will face any further disciplinary action. Meanwhile, the story has sparked a lively discussion on social media, with many users debating the merits of the school's decision and sharing their own stories of youthful enterprise.

As the conversation continues, St. John's Secondary School has reiterated its commitment to maintaining a safe and conducive learning environment. ""We encourage students to be innovative and resourceful,"" the school's spokesperson added. ""However, this must be balanced with our responsibility to uphold school policies and ensure the welfare of all students.""

The incident serves as a reminder of the challenges schools face in regulating student behavior while fostering creativity and independence. As schools across the country grapple with similar issues, the question remains: where should the line be drawn between rule enforcement and nurturing entrepreneurial talent?",gpt
"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","Stephen Sondheim, the legendary composer and lyricist whose work reshaped the landscape of American musical theater, was often described as a man who felt too much. His passing at the age of 91 left a profound void in the world of performing arts, yet his legacy endures through a canon of groundbreaking works that continue to inspire and challenge audiences around the globe.

Born on March 22, 1930, in New York City, Sondheim's early exposure to theater came through family connections and a serendipitous mentorship with Oscar Hammerstein II, a titan of the industry. Under Hammerstein's guidance, Sondheim honed his craft, developing a distinctive voice that would eventually revolutionize Broadway. His ability to infuse complex emotions and nuanced storytelling into his compositions set him apart as a master of his art.

Sondheim's career took off in 1957 with ""West Side Story,"" for which he wrote the lyrics to Leonard Bernstein's music. The show was a critical and commercial success, signaling the arrival of a new era in musical theater. His subsequent works, including ""Gypsy,"" ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" and ""Company,"" cemented his reputation as a daring and innovative force. Sondheim's musicals were notable not only for their intricate lyrics and unconventional structures but also for their exploration of deep, often unsettling themes.

The composer was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to capture the intricacies of human emotion. This was evident in the haunting melodies of ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" where he delved into the dark recesses of vengeance and madness, and in the poignant strains of ""Into the Woods,"" which examined the moral complexities of fairy tales. Sondheim's characters were never one-dimensional; they were flawed, multifaceted, and deeply human.

His work was not always immediately embraced by audiences or critics. Some productions, like ""Merrily We Roll Along,"" initially struggled to find their footing. However, many of these shows eventually gained cult followings, their once-criticized elements later hailed as strokes of genius. Sondheim's resilience and unwavering belief in his vision allowed him to push boundaries and defy conventions, ultimately reshaping the expectations of what musical theater could achieve.

Throughout his career, Sondheim received numerous accolades, including eight Tony Awards, an Academy Award, eight Grammy Awards, a Pulitzer Prize, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Yet, perhaps his greatest achievement was his ability to connect with audiences on an emotional level. Sondheim's music resonated with people from all walks of life, capturing the universal experiences of love, loss, and longing.

Despite his success, Sondheim remained a deeply introspective and private individual. Friends and collaborators often described him as a man who felt too much, whose empathy and sensitivity permeated every note he wrote. These qualities were both his gift and his burden, driving him to explore the complexities of the human condition while often leaving him vulnerable to the weight of his own emotions.

In the wake of his passing, tributes poured in from across the world. Fellow composers, actors, and fans alike shared stories of how Sondheim's work had touched their lives. His influence extended far beyond the theater, shaping the broader cultural landscape and inspiring countless artists to follow in his footsteps.

As the curtain falls on the era of Stephen Sondheim, his legacy lives on through the timeless works he left behind. From the soaring ballads of ""Sunday in the Park with George"" to the introspective musings of ""Assassins,"" his music continues to captivate and challenge, reminding us of the power of art to reflect the depths of the human soul.

Stephen Sondheim may have felt too much, but it was through this profound sensitivity that he gave voice to the complexities of the human experience, forever changing the world of musical theater in the process. His contributions will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come, a testament to the enduring impact of a true visionary.",gpt
Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"In recent years, the fashion industry has been under scrutiny for its lack of diversity and inclusion. This ongoing issue is glaringly evident in the frequency of fashion gaffes that arise from cultural insensitivity and tone-deaf marketing campaigns. These blunders serve as a stark reminder of the industry's deep-rooted diversity problem, highlighting the urgent need for a more inclusive approach.

One of the most notable instances occurred when a major luxury brand faced backlash for a sweater resembling blackface. The item was part of a high-profile collection, yet somehow, it made it through several levels of approval before reaching the public. The outrage was swift and widespread, with social media users and activists calling out the brand for its insensitivity. The incident prompted an apology and the removal of the product, but the damage was already done, illustrating a significant disconnect between the brand and the diverse consumer base it serves.

Fashion gaffes like these are not isolated incidents. In another case, a fashion house came under fire for releasing a campaign that featured models wearing culturally significant attire in a manner deemed disrespectful. Critics were quick to point out that the campaign not only appropriated but also trivialized the cultural heritage it purported to celebrate. Such missteps are often attributed to the lack of diverse voices in decision-making roles within these companies.

The absence of diversity is not just a moral failing but also a missed business opportunity. The global fashion market is incredibly diverse, with consumers from various cultural backgrounds seeking representation. By failing to embrace this diversity, brands risk alienating large segments of their customer base, leading to potential financial repercussions. Moreover, in today's digitally connected world, consumers are more vocal about their demands for inclusivity and are quick to support brands that align with their values.

Efforts to address these issues are slowly emerging, but progress is uneven. Some brands have taken proactive steps to diversify their teams, recognizing the value of varied perspectives in creating more inclusive fashion lines. Initiatives such as diversity councils and inclusive hiring practices have been implemented by a few industry leaders. However, these efforts often fall short of meaningful change, as they tend to focus on surface-level diversity rather than fostering an environment where all voices are heard and valued.

Experts argue that true inclusivity requires a fundamental shift in corporate culture. It involves not only recruiting a diverse workforce but also empowering individuals from different backgrounds to influence major decisions. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, equitable pay structures, and policies that promote inclusivity at every level of the organization.

Furthermore, the fashion industry must engage in continuous education and awareness to avoid cultural missteps. This means actively listening to and learning from the communities they aim to represent. Collaborating with cultural experts and advocates can provide valuable insights that prevent tone-deaf campaigns and ensure that products resonate positively with diverse audiences.

Consumers, too, play a crucial role in this transformation. By supporting brands that prioritize diversity and holding accountable those that do not, they can drive change from the outside. Social media has become a powerful tool for advocacy, allowing consumers to voice their concerns and amplify issues of cultural insensitivity. The public's increasing demand for accountability has put pressure on brands to align their practices with the values of inclusivity and respect.

In conclusion, fashion gaffes are symptomatic of a larger diversity problem within the industry. To move forward, fashion brands must commit to genuine inclusivity, ensuring that their teams reflect the global community they serve. This involves not just token gestures but a comprehensive approach to diversity that permeates every aspect of their operations. By doing so, the industry can not only avoid embarrassing missteps but also build a more equitable and sustainable future for fashion.",gpt
How much of your body is your own?,"In an era where technology intertwines seamlessly with the human body, the question of bodily autonomy—how much of your body is truly your own—has become a focal point of ethical and legal debates. From wearable tech and medical implants to the increasingly pervasive biotechnology industry, the boundaries of personal ownership and control over one's body are being redefined.

The concept of bodily autonomy has historically been straightforward: you own your body. However, the rapid advancements in medical science and technology have complicated this notion. Medical devices, such as pacemakers and cochlear implants, are now commonplace, and while they significantly improve quality of life, they come with strings attached. These devices often require software updates, which are controlled by the companies that manufacture them rather than the individuals who rely on them.

This issue raises questions about consent and control. For instance, if a pacemaker can be remotely accessed and updated, who has the ultimate authority over its operation? In some cases, patients have reported losing access to critical updates or being subjected to involuntary changes, sparking debates about the balance between corporate control and personal autonomy.

Beyond medical devices, wearable technology such as fitness trackers and smartwatches also contributes to the discourse on bodily autonomy. These devices continuously collect data about their users—heart rate, movement, sleep patterns—transmitting this information to cloud servers. Users may own the physical device, but do they own the data it collects? Many companies argue that they have rights to this data, often outlined in lengthy terms of service agreements that few read. This has led to concerns about privacy and the commercialization of personal health information.

The legal landscape surrounding bodily autonomy is just as complex. Laws vary significantly across jurisdictions, and many have yet to catch up with technological advancements. In the United States, for instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) offers some protections concerning medical data, but the rise of wearable technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents new challenges that existing laws may not adequately address.

Moreover, the increasing prevalence of genetic testing services, like those offered by companies such as 23andMe and AncestryDNA, adds another layer to the discussion. These services require users to submit their DNA, which is then analyzed and stored. While users may gain valuable insights into their ancestry or health predispositions, they often relinquish significant control over their genetic information. Companies may retain rights to use this data for research, sometimes even partnering with pharmaceutical companies, raising ethical questions about consent and profit from personal biological information.

The implications of these developments extend beyond individual concerns, touching on broader societal issues, including healthcare equity and discrimination. As more personal data becomes available, there is potential for misuse, such as discrimination based on genetic predispositions or health data. For instance, could employers or insurance companies use such information to make decisions about hiring or coverage?

In response to these concerns, advocacy groups and policymakers are calling for stronger regulations to protect individuals' rights over their bodies and their data. Some propose new laws that explicitly address the ownership of digital and biological data, ensuring individuals retain control over how their information is used and shared.

As technology continues to evolve, so too will the conversation around bodily autonomy. The challenge lies in finding a balance that respects individual rights while embracing the benefits of innovation. For now, the question of how much of your body is your own remains a poignant reminder of the complex relationship between humans and technology in the modern age.

In conclusion, the dialogue around bodily autonomy is far from settled. With each technological advancement comes new ethical and legal questions that society must address. As individuals, understanding the implications of these developments is crucial, not just for personal empowerment but for shaping a future where technology enhances human life without compromising fundamental rights.",gpt
"West Covina Parents Arrested After 9-Month-Old Girl Found To Have Cocaine, Meth In Her System","Authorities in West Covina, California, have arrested two parents after their 9-month-old daughter was found with cocaine and methamphetamine in her system, sparking outrage and concern across the community. The parents, identified as 29-year-old Ethan Carter and 27-year-old Jessica Martinez, are facing serious charges of child endangerment and drug-related offenses.

The distressing discovery came to light after the infant was admitted to a local hospital due to symptoms of unusual lethargy and irritability. Medical staff conducted a series of tests that revealed the presence of both cocaine and methamphetamine in her bloodstream. Alarmed by the findings, the hospital immediately notified the West Covina Police Department, prompting a swift investigation into the circumstances surrounding the child's condition.

According to police reports, officers responded to the hospital late Tuesday night after receiving the call. Upon arrival, investigators interviewed medical personnel and the parents, who were present at the hospital. The parents allegedly provided inconsistent accounts of how their daughter could have been exposed to the drugs, raising suspicions among the authorities.

Following further investigation, a search warrant was executed at the family's residence on Wednesday morning. Officers reportedly discovered drug paraphernalia and small quantities of narcotics within the home, further implicating the parents in the case. The items were seized as evidence, and the residence was thoroughly inspected for any additional hazards.

West Covina Police Chief, Lisa Morales, addressed the media during a press conference held on Thursday afternoon. ""This is a deeply troubling situation,"" she stated. ""The safety and well-being of our community's children are of utmost importance, and we are committed to ensuring that justice is served in this case. We urge anyone with additional information to come forward.""

The child has since been placed in the protective custody of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Officials have confirmed that she is currently in stable condition but will remain under medical observation for the time being. Child welfare authorities are conducting their own investigation to determine the best course of action for the infant's future care.

Neighbors in the quiet suburban neighborhood expressed shock and disbelief at the news of the arrests. ""I would never have imagined something like this happening here,"" said Maria Gonzalez, a resident who lives just a few houses down from the family. ""It's heartbreaking to think about what that little girl went through.""

Community members and local organizations have already begun rallying support for the child, with some offering donations and resources to assist in her recovery and long-term care. A vigil is being planned for this weekend to raise awareness about the dangers of drug exposure and to show solidarity with the affected child.

Ethan Carter and Jessica Martinez are currently being held in custody at the Los Angeles County Jail. They are expected to be formally charged in the coming days. If convicted, they could face significant prison sentences given the severity of the charges.

Legal experts indicate that cases involving drug exposure to minors often lead to harsh penalties, reflecting the judicial system's emphasis on protecting vulnerable children from harm. ""This case will likely prompt a thorough examination of the parents' lifestyle and any potential risk factors that may have contributed to this tragic situation,"" said criminal defense attorney Mark Reynolds.

The incident has also reignited conversations about the broader issue of drug abuse within family environments. Community leaders are calling for increased support and resources for families struggling with substance abuse, emphasizing the need for preventative measures to protect children from similar dangers.

As the investigation continues, the West Covina community remains on edge, grappling with the unsettling reality of a child so young being exposed to such harmful substances. Authorities have assured the public that they will pursue all necessary avenues to ensure accountability and prevent future occurrences.

For now, the focus remains on the well-being of the young girl, whose life has been irrevocably altered by the events of this week. The community hopes for her recovery and for justice to be served swiftly and fairly.",gpt

Transcripts,"In a world where information flows like water, the role of transcripts has emerged as a critical tool in maintaining transparency and accountability across various sectors. From political arenas to educational institutions, the demand for accurate and accessible transcripts has surged, reflecting society's growing insistence on clarity and truth.

The significance of transcripts was recently underscored in a high-profile congressional hearing where key testimonies were recorded and transcribed. These transcripts, made available to both lawmakers and the public, have provided an invaluable resource for scrutinizing the proceedings and ensuring that the narratives put forth are both accurate and comprehensive. They serve as a reminder of the power that documented words hold in shaping public opinion and policy.

In education, transcripts play a pivotal role beyond their traditional function of recording academic performance. As online courses and remote learning become increasingly prevalent, digital transcripts have adapted to provide a more nuanced picture of student engagement and achievement. These modern transcripts not only include grades but also information about participation, projects, and other activities that reflect a student's learning journey. This evolution is crucial in an era where holistic education is prioritized, and employers seek a more detailed understanding of a candidate's capabilities.

Transcripts are also gaining importance in the legal domain, where they form the backbone of judicial proceedings. Court transcripts ensure that legal processes are transparent, allowing verdicts to be contested or upheld based on an accurate record of what transpired in the courtroom. This aspect of transcripts is fundamental in protecting the integrity of the justice system, offering a precise account that lawyers and judges can reference to uphold the rule of law.

However, the increasing reliance on transcripts has not been without challenges. The accuracy of transcripts, especially those generated by automated systems, has been called into question. Errors in transcription can lead to misunderstandings that have serious repercussions, particularly in legal and political contexts. This has prompted a push for improved technology and greater oversight to ensure that transcripts remain reliable.

In response to these challenges, several tech companies are investing in advanced transcription software powered by artificial intelligence. These systems promise higher accuracy and speed, reducing the margin for error significantly. Nonetheless, human oversight remains critical. Experienced transcribers are essential in reviewing and editing AI-generated transcripts, ensuring that nuances and context are correctly captured.

The issue of accessibility is another concern being addressed in the realm of transcripts. As more organizations recognize the need to cater to diverse audiences, there is a push to make transcripts available in multiple languages and formats. This move not only broadens the reach of information but also supports inclusivity, allowing individuals with disabilities or language barriers to engage fully with content.

In the corporate world, transcripts have become indispensable tools for ensuring transparency in communications. Earnings calls, board meetings, and shareholder presentations are routinely transcribed, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of a company's direction and performance. These transcripts can influence investor confidence and impact stock prices, underscoring their importance in the financial ecosystem.

Furthermore, transcripts are playing an increasingly vital role in media and journalism. As news outlets strive to maintain credibility, providing transcripts of interviews and press conferences has become a standard practice. This not only aids in fact-checking but also allows audiences to access the original content, fostering trust between media organizations and the public.

The rise of podcasts and video content has also highlighted the importance of transcripts in the digital age. Providing transcripts for these formats enhances accessibility and searchability, allowing users to find specific information quickly. This feature is particularly beneficial for researchers and enthusiasts who rely on precise data for their work or interests.

As society continues to value transparency and accountability, the role of transcripts is set to expand further. They represent a commitment to clarity in communication, serving as a bridge between spoken words and documented truth. Whether in politics, education, law, or media, transcripts will undoubtedly remain a cornerstone of informed discourse and decision-making.",gpt
MLB Life Put on Hold amid Rising Coronavirus Concerns,"Major League Baseball (MLB) is facing a significant upheaval as rising coronavirus concerns have forced the league to pause its operations indefinitely. Teams, players, and fans find themselves in a state of uncertainty as the sporting world grapples with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, raising questions about the future of the current season.

The decision to halt the league comes after a spate of positive tests among players and staff across several teams, prompting MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred to put the season on hold. ""The health and safety of our players, staff, and fans remain our top priority. Given the current trajectory of COVID-19 cases, it has become necessary to take a step back and reassess our situation,"" Manfred said in a statement on Thursday.

The move has sent shockwaves through the baseball community, with many expressing disappointment yet understanding of the decision. ""It's frustrating, for sure,"" said Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts. ""We all want to be out there playing, but we have to be responsible and look at the bigger picture. Health comes first.""

This pause marks the second major disruption to the MLB calendar in recent years due to the pandemic. In 2020, the league had to delay its opening day and shorten the season to 60 games. The current stoppage is reminiscent of those uncertain times, as teams scramble to adjust their schedules and maintain their fitness levels while adhering to health guidelines.

The rise in COVID-19 cases is attributed to the spread of a new variant, which has led to increased transmission rates across the country. Public health officials have warned of the potential for further spikes as the weather turns colder, prompting renewed calls for vaccinations and booster shots. MLB has been actively encouraging its players and staff to get vaccinated, with some teams already reporting high vaccination rates among their ranks.

Despite the league's efforts, the virus has continued to impact teams, leading to postponed games and disrupted travel plans. The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox were among the teams affected, with both reporting multiple positive cases in recent weeks. The situation has put a strain on team rosters, forcing managers to rely on minor league call-ups to fill gaps.

For fans, the suspension of the season is a bitter pill to swallow. Many had hoped for a return to normalcy this year, with stadiums allowing full capacity crowds and the excitement of a full 162-game season. However, the current pause has rekindled memories of the 2020 season's disruptions, leaving fans anxious about what lies ahead.

""I'm just hoping they can get things under control quickly so we can get back to enjoying the games,"" said Sarah Johnson, a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan. ""It's been a tough couple of years, and baseball is one of the few things that brings a sense of normalcy.""

The financial implications of the pause are also a growing concern. Teams are expected to face revenue losses from ticket sales, concessions, and broadcasting deals. The broader economic impact extends to local businesses that rely on game-day traffic, such as bars, restaurants, and merchandise vendors.

In response to these challenges, MLB is working closely with health experts and government officials to develop a comprehensive plan to resume the season safely. Potential measures include enhanced testing protocols, stricter quarantine guidelines, and potentially implementing a bubble environment akin to the NBA's successful strategy in 2020.

While the timeline for resuming the season remains uncertain, the hope is that the league can find a path forward that prioritizes safety while preserving the integrity of the sport. ""We're committed to getting back on the field as soon as it's safe to do so,"" said Manfred. ""In the meantime, we appreciate the patience and understanding of our fans and the hard work of everyone involved in navigating these unprecedented challenges.""

As MLB navigates these turbulent waters, one thing remains clear: the love for baseball endures, even in the face of adversity. Whether it's in packed stadiums or through screens, fans and players alike eagerly await the moment when the crack of the bat and the roar of the crowd can once again be part of their daily lives.",gpt
'We are failing the elephants',"In a poignant statement that reverberates across the globe, conservationists have declared, ""We are failing the elephants."" This stark declaration comes amidst alarming reports of declining elephant populations, primarily driven by human activities such as poaching, habitat destruction, and climate change. The survival of these majestic creatures, which have long been symbols of strength and wisdom, is now hanging in the balance.

Recent data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) paints a grim picture. African elephant populations have plummeted by over 30% in the past decade, while Asian elephants face similar threats, with numbers declining by at least 50% over the last three generations. The primary culprits remain the illegal ivory trade and increasing human-elephant conflicts as their habitats shrink.

Dr. Jane Goodall, renowned primatologist and fierce advocate for wildlife conservation, expressed deep concern over the current state of elephant populations. ""We are at a critical juncture,"" she said during a global conservation summit held in Nairobi. ""If we do not take urgent and comprehensive actions now, we risk losing these gentle giants forever.""

The illegal ivory trade remains one of the most significant threats to elephants. Despite international bans on ivory sales, demand persists, driven by lucrative black markets in parts of Asia and beyond. In 2022 alone, authorities seized over 40 tons of illegal ivory, a fraction of what experts believe is trafficked annually. Conservation groups argue that stronger enforcement and harsher penalties for poachers and traffickers are crucial to curb this devastating trade.

Habitat destruction is another critical factor contributing to the decline in elephant numbers. As human populations expand, forests and grasslands are being converted into agricultural land and urban areas, encroaching into elephant habitats. This encroachment not only reduces the space available for elephants to roam but also increases the likelihood of human-elephant conflicts. In countries like India and Thailand, such conflicts often result in casualties on both sides, further exacerbating the crisis.

To address these issues, conservationists are calling for comprehensive strategies that include community-based conservation efforts, stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws, and global cooperation to dismantle poaching networks. Local communities, who often bear the brunt of human-elephant conflicts, are seen as pivotal in these efforts. By involving them in conservation and providing incentives for protecting elephants, there is hope for creating a sustainable coexistence.

Education and awareness campaigns also play a vital role in changing perceptions and reducing demand for ivory. ""We need to make people understand that elephants are worth far more alive than dead,"" said Dr. Paula Kahumbu, CEO of WildlifeDirect, a Kenyan-based conservation organization. ""Through education, we can foster a new generation of conservationists who will value and protect these incredible animals.""

On the global stage, several countries have taken significant steps to combat the ivory trade and protect elephants. China, once the largest market for ivory, implemented a near-total ban on ivory sales in 2017. The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union have also tightened their regulations. However, conservationists argue that more countries need to follow suit and that international cooperation is crucial in addressing the transnational nature of wildlife trafficking.

Despite the daunting challenges, there are glimmers of hope. In some regions, elephant populations are showing signs of recovery, thanks to concerted conservation efforts. In Kenya, for example, the elephant population has increased by 12% over the past decade, a testament to the impact of effective conservation strategies and community involvement.

Nevertheless, the overarching message from conservationists remains clear: the world must act swiftly and decisively to prevent elephants from becoming another tragic symbol of human-induced extinction. As Dr. Goodall poignantly warned, ""The loss of elephants would not only be a devastating blow to biodiversity but a profound moral failure for humanity.""

The call to action is urgent and unequivocal. To preserve these majestic creatures for future generations, a collective effort is required—one that transcends borders and unites people in a shared mission to save the elephants.",gpt
Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.,"In a tale of survival and loss, two women from the same neighborhood in Chicago contracted COVID-19 earlier this year. Their stories highlight the unpredictable nature of the virus and the profound impact it continues to have on communities across the world.

Mary Thompson, a 67-year-old retired schoolteacher, and her neighbor, 59-year-old Angela Rivera, a nurse at a local clinic, had always been close. Living on the same street for over two decades, their friendship blossomed over shared interests and mutual support. They often attended community events together and were well-known figures in their locality.

In late January, both women started experiencing mild symptoms that quickly escalated. Thompson initially dismissed her cough and slight fever as a seasonal cold. Rivera, familiar with the symptoms due to her profession, suspected otherwise and urged Thompson to get tested. By the time they both received their positive COVID-19 diagnoses, their conditions had worsened significantly.

Thompson, who had underlying health conditions including hypertension and diabetes, was immediately admitted to the hospital. Her family was devastated but hopeful, clinging to the stories of recovery they had heard. However, as days turned into weeks, her condition deteriorated. Despite the tireless efforts of the medical staff, Thompson passed away on February 14, leaving behind her husband, two children, and four grandchildren.

Her daughter, Lisa Thompson, described her mother as a ""pillar of strength"" and ""a beacon of love and kindness"" within the family. “She was always there for everyone, with an open heart and a listening ear. It’s hard to believe she’s gone,” Lisa said, holding back tears during a virtual memorial service attended by friends and family across the globe.

Meanwhile, Rivera’s condition also took a turn for the worse, but she managed to avoid hospitalization due to early intervention and rigorous home care. Her son, Alex Rivera, moved back home temporarily to care for her, ensuring she adhered to a strict regimen of medication, nutrition, and rest. After a grueling three weeks, Rivera began to recover, much to the relief of her family and friends.

Rivera attributes her survival to early detection, the unwavering support of her family, and the healthcare workers who provided guidance remotely. “I’m grateful every single day,” she said, her voice filled with emotion. “I know many aren’t as fortunate, and my heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones.”

The contrasting outcomes for Thompson and Rivera underscore the unpredictable trajectory of the coronavirus. Experts emphasize that while certain risk factors like age and preexisting conditions can influence the severity of COVID-19, the virus can affect anyone, sometimes with devastating consequences.

Dr. Emily Carter, an infectious disease specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, explains, “We’ve seen a wide range of outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and unfortunately, there’s still much we don’t fully understand about why some individuals recover while others don’t. What remains crucial is early detection and adherence to public health guidelines.”

The community has rallied around the Thompson family, organizing support through meal deliveries and a GoFundMe campaign to help with medical and funeral expenses. Rivera has also been active in raising awareness about COVID-19, sharing her experiences with local organizations to encourage vigilance and community support.

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, stories like those of Thompson and Rivera serve as poignant reminders of the virus's impact. They highlight the importance of community, the need for compassion, and the unwavering human spirit in the face of adversity.

Both families have expressed their gratitude for the support they have received and hope that sharing their experiences might help others navigate similar challenges. “In the end, it’s about being there for each other,” said Rivera. “That’s what Mary would have wanted, and that’s what I’m committed to doing.”",gpt

Dow Surges to Record High as Investors Shrug Off Inflation Concerns

Wall Street closed out the week on a high note, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a new all-time record on Friday. The blue-chip index climbed 0.8%, or 274 points, to 35,913, surpassing its previous record set in early November.

The S&P 500 also gained 0.5% to 4,697, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2% to 15,984. The strong performance came despite persistent concerns over rising inflation and the potential for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected.

""Investors seem to be shrugging off the inflation worries and focusing more on the strong corporate earnings and economic growth we've seen,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""As long as the Fed can keep inflation under control, the market is likely to continue its upward trajectory.""

Indeed, several major companies reported better-than-expected quarterly results this week, including Walmart, Home Depot, and Cisco Systems. This has helped offset concerns about supply chain disruptions and labor shortages that have been weighing on some industries.

""The strong earnings season has been a real bright spot, and it's giving investors confidence that the economy can continue to grow even as we face these various challenges,"" said Arone.

The rally was broad-based, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finishing the day in positive territory. Energy stocks led the way, gaining 2.3% as oil prices climbed above $80 per barrel. Financials and materials companies also posted solid gains.

The positive sentiment was not limited to the US, either. Global markets also rose, with the STOXX Europe 600 index closing up 0.6% and Japan's Nikkei 225 index gaining 0.9%.

""There's a sense that the global economy is on a solid footing, despite the headwinds we're facing,"" said Arone. ""Investors are looking past the near-term challenges and focusing on the longer-term growth potential.""

One potential wild card, however, is the ongoing debate in Washington over President Biden's sweeping social and climate spending plan. The fate of the $1.75 trillion package remains uncertain, and any delays or changes could impact market sentiment.

""The political uncertainty in Washington is something we're keeping a close eye on,"" said Arone. ""But for now, the market seems to be shrugging it off and focusing on the fundamentals.""

Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching the latest inflation data, which is due to be released next week. The consumer price index (CPI) is expected to show another significant increase, potentially putting more pressure on the Fed to act.

""The inflation numbers will be a key data point, and they could sway the Fed's decision-making,"" said Arone. ""But overall, the market seems to be in a good place, and I think we could see further gains in the weeks and months ahead.""",claude
I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"""I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.""

In a heartfelt and reflective piece, Sarah Johnson, a 42-year-old mother of two, shares her personal journey from being the unpopular kid in school to navigating the complexities of parenthood.

Growing up, Johnson struggled with the social challenges that many children face. ""I was always the one sitting alone at the lunch table, the last one picked for team sports, and the target of cruel taunts and exclusion,"" she recounts. ""It was a painful experience that left deep scars.""

Now, as a parent herself, Johnson has gained a newfound appreciation for the trials and tribulations of childhood. ""When I see my own children navigating the social landscape of school, I can't help but empathize with the struggles they face,"" she says. ""It's a humbling realization that the challenges I went through are still very much a reality for many young people.""

One of the most significant lessons Johnson has learned is the importance of fostering a sense of belonging and acceptance in her children's lives. ""As a parent, I've made it a priority to create a supportive and inclusive environment at home,"" she explains. ""I encourage my kids to be themselves, to embrace their unique qualities, and to surround themselves with friends who appreciate and value them.""

Johnson has also discovered the power of open communication and emotional support. ""I make a conscious effort to listen to my children, to validate their feelings, and to offer guidance without judgment,"" she says. ""I want them to know that they can always come to me with their struggles, without fear of being dismissed or belittled.""

Additionally, Johnson has learned the value of teaching her children the skills to navigate social situations effectively. ""I've worked with them on developing their social skills, such as active listening, empathy, and conflict resolution,"" she explains. ""These tools not only help them build stronger relationships but also equip them with the resilience to handle the inevitable challenges that come with growing up.""

Perhaps most importantly, Johnson has realized the significance of her own role as a parent in shaping her children's social experiences. ""As a parent, I have the opportunity to be a positive role model, to demonstrate kindness, compassion, and acceptance,"" she says. ""By modeling these behaviors, I hope to instill in my children the values that I wish I had been shown as a child.""

Looking back on her own struggles with social acceptance, Johnson acknowledges the lasting impact it has had on her life. ""The pain of being the unpopular kid never fully goes away,"" she admits. ""But I've learned to transform that experience into a source of empathy and understanding, which I believe makes me a better parent.""

Johnson's story serves as a poignant reminder that the lessons we learn from our own childhood experiences can profoundly shape the way we approach parenting. By drawing on her personal struggles, she has found a way to create a more nurturing and supportive environment for her own children, helping them navigate the complexities of social life with greater resilience and self-acceptance.",claude
The coronavirus pandemic is closing schools. How will kids eat?,"The coronavirus pandemic is closing schools. How will kids eat?

As schools across the country close their doors in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, millions of students are left without access to the free or reduced-price meals they rely on. With parents facing job losses and economic uncertainty, experts warn that food insecurity among children could reach crisis levels in the coming weeks and months.

""This is an unprecedented situation,"" said Dr. Janet Poppendieck, a professor of sociology at Hunter College and an expert on food assistance programs. ""School meals are a critical source of nutrition for low-income children, and with schools shutting down, we're facing the very real possibility of a dramatic increase in childhood hunger.""

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, over 22 million children receive free or reduced-price meals through the National School Lunch Program each day. For many of these students, these meals provide their primary source of daily sustenance.

""A lot of families are just one paycheck away from not being able to put food on the table,"" said Poppendieck. ""When you factor in job losses, reduced work hours, and the added burden of having kids home from school all day, the strain on household budgets is going to be immense.""

In an effort to address this looming crisis, school districts and nonprofit organizations across the country have scrambled to set up emergency food distribution programs. Many are providing free ""grab-and-go"" meal services, where families can pick up pre-packaged breakfasts and lunches for their children.

""It's been amazing to see the community come together in this time of need,"" said Sarah Thompson, the food services director for the Anytown School District. ""Our staff has been working around the clock to ensure that no child goes hungry.""

However, experts warn that these ad-hoc solutions may not be enough to meet the growing demand. Logistical challenges, such as transportation and food supply issues, could hamper the ability of these programs to reach all the children who need assistance.

""We're already seeing long lines and overwhelmed distribution sites,"" said Poppendieck. ""And as more businesses close and unemployment rises, the number of families in need is only going to increase.""

To address these concerns, some lawmakers and advocacy groups are calling for immediate federal intervention. Earlier this week, a coalition of 74 national organizations sent a letter to congressional leaders, urging them to include robust child nutrition provisions in any upcoming coronavirus relief legislation.

""This is a national emergency, and we need a national response,"" said Cathy Demeroto, the executive director of the National Anti-Hunger Organizations. ""Congress must act quickly to provide the resources and flexibility needed to ensure that no child goes hungry during this crisis.""

Potential solutions proposed in the letter include increasing funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), expanding the Summer Food Service Program to provide meals year-round, and allowing schools to serve meals directly to families without the usual administrative requirements.

""Time is of the essence,"" Demeroto said. ""With each passing day, more children are at risk of going without the nutrition they need to grow and thrive. We have a moral obligation to step up and protect the most vulnerable members of our society.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt daily life, the fight against childhood hunger has taken on a new urgency. With schools closed and families facing economic hardship, the road ahead may be long and difficult. But with swift and decisive action, experts believe that the worst of the crisis can be averted.

""This is a moment that will define us as a society,"" said Poppendieck. ""How we respond to the needs of our children in this time of crisis will have lasting consequences. We must rise to the occasion and ensure that no child is left behind.""",claude
US-Mexico border: Pregnant woman from Guatemala dies after fall from wall,"US-Mexico Border: Pregnant Woman from Guatemala Dies After Fall from Wall

In a tragic incident that has once again highlighted the dangers faced by migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border, a pregnant woman from Guatemala has died after falling from a section of the border wall near El Paso, Texas.

The incident occurred on Monday evening when the 32-year-old woman, who has not been publicly identified, was attempting to scale the wall with a group of other migrants. According to the US Border Patrol, the woman fell approximately 18 feet to the ground on the Mexican side of the border.

Immediately after the fall, the woman was rushed to a nearby hospital in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, where she was pronounced dead. Authorities have confirmed that the woman was several months pregnant at the time of the incident.

""This is a devastating tragedy,"" said Raul Ortiz, the Chief of the US Border Patrol. ""Our condolences go out to the family and loved ones of the deceased. We continue to urge migrants not to attempt these dangerous border crossings, as the risks to their safety and wellbeing are simply too high.""

The border wall in the area where the incident took place is approximately 18 feet tall and is equipped with various security features, including surveillance cameras and motion sensors. However, the wall has not been able to deter determined migrants from attempting to cross, often with tragic consequences.

According to data from the International Organization for Migration, at least 650 migrants have died while attempting to cross the US-Mexico border since the start of 2021. Many of these deaths have been the result of falls from the border wall, as well as dehydration, drowning, and other hazards associated with the treacherous journey.

The Biden administration has faced criticism from both sides of the political aisle for its handling of the ongoing immigration crisis at the southern border. While the president has taken steps to roll back some of the more restrictive policies implemented by his predecessor, the influx of migrants seeking to enter the United States has continued to strain the resources of border authorities and local communities.

In response to the latest incident, the White House issued a statement expressing its condolences to the family of the deceased woman and reiterating the administration's commitment to addressing the root causes of migration in Central America.

""This is a heartbreaking tragedy, and our thoughts are with the family of the woman who lost her life,"" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. ""The Biden administration remains dedicated to working with our partners in the region to tackle the underlying issues driving migration, while also ensuring the safety and security of our borders.""

As the investigation into the incident continues, advocacy groups and human rights organizations have called for a renewed focus on the humanitarian aspects of the border crisis, including the provision of more resources and support for vulnerable migrants.

""This woman's death is a devastating reminder of the immense risks that migrants face in their pursuit of a better life,"" said Marisa Limón Garza, the deputy director of the Hope Border Institute. ""We must do more to address the root causes of migration and provide safe, legal pathways for those seeking refuge and opportunity.""

The tragic loss of life at the US-Mexico border is a sobering reminder of the human toll of the ongoing immigration crisis. As policymakers and stakeholders continue to grapple with this complex issue, the hope is that greater emphasis will be placed on finding compassionate, sustainable solutions that prioritize the safety and wellbeing of all those affected.",claude
An Online Generation Redefines Mourning,"An Online Generation Redefines Mourning

In the digital age, the way we grieve and honor the dead has undergone a profound transformation. As traditional funeral practices evolve, a new generation is pioneering innovative ways to commemorate and process loss, blending time-honored rituals with the power of online platforms.

The rise of social media has given birth to a novel form of collective mourning, where individuals can share their grief, offer condolences, and find solace in virtual communities. ""Obituaries and memorial pages on Facebook have become a common way for people to express their emotions and connect with others who are experiencing similar losses,"" explains Dr. Jessica Langer, a sociologist specializing in digital culture.

This digital mourning takes many forms, from sharing personal stories and photos to lighting virtual candles and participating in online vigils. ""The ability to leave comments, share memories, and engage with others in real-time has provided a sense of togetherness that can be difficult to replicate in physical gatherings,"" says Langer.

For younger generations, in particular, the online sphere has become a primary space for processing grief. ""Millennials and Gen Z have grown up with social media as a natural extension of their lives, so it's only natural that they would turn to these platforms to navigate the emotional complexities of loss,"" explains grief counselor Emily Walton.

Walton notes that the anonymity and accessibility of online platforms can make it easier for some individuals to express themselves openly and seek support. ""For those who may feel uncomfortable or inhibited in traditional mourning settings, the digital space offers a more comfortable and inclusive environment to share their feelings.""

However, the blending of grief and technology has also raised concerns about the potential for misuse or insensitivity. ""There's a fine line between honoring the memory of a loved one and turning it into a public spectacle,"" says Langer. ""It's important that we approach online mourning with empathy and respect, ensuring that it serves as a genuine expression of grief rather than a performative display.""

Funeral homes and death care professionals have also had to adapt to this evolving landscape. ""We've seen a growing demand for live-streamed funerals and memorial services, allowing those who cannot physically attend to still participate in the grieving process,"" says funeral director Sarah Oliveira.

Additionally, some funeral homes have embraced the use of social media and online platforms to provide resources and support for grieving families. ""By creating dedicated memorial pages or online grief support groups, we can help connect individuals who may be geographically dispersed but share a common experience of loss,"" Oliveira explains.

As the digital generation continues to redefine the boundaries of mourning, experts emphasize the importance of striking a balance between the convenience and community of online platforms and the enduring significance of in-person rituals.

""Ultimately, the goal should be to create a holistic approach to grief that acknowledges the value of both physical and digital spaces,"" says Walton.

"In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism","In 2017, Trump Revived Feminism, Saved Satire and Reinvigorated Journalism

By Jane Doe, Correspondent

In a surprising turn of events, the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States has had a remarkable impact on some of the most important pillars of American society - feminism, satire, and journalism.

Feminism Resurgent
The 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the first woman to be nominated for president by a major party, was a devastating blow to the feminist movement. However, the new administration's policies and Trump's own controversial statements have paradoxically led to a resurgence of feminist activism.

""The election of Trump was a major setback for women's rights and gender equality,"" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, a professor of women's studies at a leading university. ""But it also galvanized the feminist movement in a way we haven't seen in decades.""

The Women's March, held the day after Trump's inauguration, was the largest single-day protest in US history, with an estimated 4.6 million participants nationwide. This was followed by a renewed focus on issues like reproductive rights, pay equity, and sexual harassment, with the #MeToo movement gaining unprecedented momentum.

""Trump's presidency has been a wake-up call,"" said Jessica Watkins, a organizer with the National Organization for Women. ""Women across the country have realized that the fight for equality is far from over, and they are more motivated than ever to make their voices heard.""

Satire Saved
The election of Donald Trump has also had a profound impact on the world of political satire. Satirists who had grown complacent during the Obama era found themselves with a new wellspring of material, as Trump's unorthodox behavior and divisive policies provided endless fodder for comedic commentary.

""Trump is a gift to political satirists,"" said John Oliver, host of HBO's ""Last Week Tonight."" ""His constant stream of outrageous statements and tweets make it almost impossible to keep up.""

Programs like ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""The Daily Show,"" and ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" have seen a surge in viewership and critical acclaim for their biting takedowns of the Trump administration. Even traditional news outlets like The Onion and The Borowitz Report have experienced a renaissance, as their satirical articles have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from actual news.

""In a way, Trump has saved satire,"" said Samantha Bee, host of ""Full Frontal with Samantha Bee."" ""He's given us a level of absurdity and hypocrisy that we haven't seen in a long time, and it's our job as satirists to hold a mirror up to that and make people laugh - and think - about the state of our country.""

Journalism Reinvigorated
Perhaps the most significant impact of the Trump presidency has been on the field of journalism. The administration's frequent attacks on the media, labeling them as ""fake news"" and the ""enemy of the people,"" have paradoxically led to a renewed appreciation for the vital role of a free and independent press.

""Trump's hostility towards the media has been a double-edged sword,"" said Bob Woodward, the legendary investigative journalist who helped uncover the Watergate scandal. ""On one hand, it has made our job more difficult and dangerous. But on the other, it has reminded the public of the importance of holding those in power accountable.""

Newspapers and news organizations have seen a surge in subscriptions and donations, as readers have rallied to support journalism in the face of the administration's onslaught. Investigative reporting has also experienced a renaissance, with journalists uncovering a steady stream of scandals and controversies within the Trump White House.

""It's been a challenging time, but also an exciting one,"" said Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for The New York Times. ""Trump's constant attacks on the media have forced us to be more vigilant, more thorough, and more courageous in our reporting. In a way, he's reinvigorated the profession of journalism.""

As the Trump presidency enters its third year, the long-term impact of his administration on these crucial societal institutions remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the 45th",claude
Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does

WASHINGTON, D.C. - In a press conference on Friday, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, unlocking new federal resources and authorities to combat the spread of the virus.

The emergency declaration, made under the Stafford Act, frees up to $50 billion in federal aid to state and local governments and gives the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) the ability to coordinate disaster relief efforts. It also allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain regulatory requirements, making it easier for healthcare providers to deliver services.

""I am officially declaring a national emergency,"" Trump said, calling the move ""very comprehensive"" and ""the biggest thing we've done."" The president said the declaration would ""unleash the full power of the federal government"" in the fight against COVID-19.

The declaration comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. continues to rise rapidly, with over 1,700 cases and 41 deaths reported as of Friday afternoon. Public health experts have warned that the true number of infections is likely much higher due to limited testing capabilities.

Under the Stafford Act, the president can declare an ""emergency"" when the situation is of ""such severity and magnitude"" that state and local governments' resources are overwhelmed. This unlocks additional federal aid and coordination, though the specifics can vary depending on the declaration.

In this case, the emergency declaration gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to waive certain Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP requirements. This could include expanding telemedicine access, allowing hospitals to provide care at alternative sites, and easing licensing requirements for healthcare workers.

The declaration also empowers FEMA to step in and coordinate the federal government's disaster response efforts. FEMA can now provide equipment, supplies, and logistical support to state and local authorities, as well as activate the Disaster Relief Fund to cover expenses.

Additionally, the emergency declaration allows the president to tap into the Stafford Act's Public Assistance program, which provides grants to state and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to assist with emergency protective measures and debris removal.

However, the declaration does not automatically trigger all available federal resources. The president must still request specific types of federal aid, such as medical supplies or hospital beds, and the government must determine that state and local capabilities are insufficient.

Critics have argued that the Trump administration was slow to take aggressive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak, downplaying the threat in the early stages. The president has faced bipartisan criticism for the lack of widespread testing and delays in the production and distribution of test kits.

In his remarks on Friday, Trump acknowledged the testing issues, saying the government is working to accelerate the process. ""The testing has been going very smooth,"" he claimed, despite reports of long lines and limited access to tests in many areas.

The emergency declaration comes as Congress is negotiating a stimulus package to provide economic relief to Americans and businesses affected by the outbreak. The administration is reportedly seeking $850 billion in aid, including a payroll tax cut and assistance for the airline industry.

Overall, the declaration of a national emergency represents a significant escalation of the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, its ultimate impact will depend on how the administration utilizes the new authorities and resources made available through the Stafford Act.",claude
Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions

Washington, D.C. - As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the United States, health officials tasked with leading the country's response have increasingly turned to praising President Donald Trump when faced with tough questions about the administration's handling of the crisis.

The trend was on full display during a White House press briefing earlier this week, when Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, was pressed by a reporter about the lack of widespread testing available to Americans. Instead of directly addressing the criticism, Birx launched into a lengthy monologue extolling the president's leadership.

""I just want to thank the president for his decisive action,"" Birx said. ""From the very beginning, he took this incredibly seriously and has been working tirelessly to ensure we have the resources and support we need to combat this virus.""

Birx went on to praise Trump's decision to restrict travel from China in late January, calling it a ""profound impact"" that ""gave us the time"" to prepare the nation's response. She made no mention of the administration's subsequent failures to ramp up testing capabilities or the president's own downplaying of the threat in the crucial weeks that followed.

The pattern has repeated itself time and again during the pandemic, with other top health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Robert Redfield also quick to laud the president's actions when pressed on missteps or shortcomings.

""It's become this bizarre ritual where these public health experts feel compelled to lavish praise on the president, even when the facts on the ground contradict that,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University and former Baltimore health commissioner.

""I understand they're trying to maintain a good working relationship and keep the lines of communication open, but it ends up undermining their credibility and the important messages they're trying to convey.""

The dynamic has drawn criticism from health policy experts who argue it reflects a concerning political pressure being exerted on the nation's top infectious disease specialists. They warn it could further erode public trust in the government's response at a critical juncture.

""These are career public health professionals who are being put in an impossible position,"" said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. ""They know the reality on the ground doesn't always match the rhetoric coming from the White House, but they feel like they have to play along to keep their access and influence.""

White House officials have denied any improper pressure on health officials, with spokesman Judd Deere saying the administration has simply been ""grateful"" for their expertise and ""tireless work"" during the crisis.

But the trend has not been lost on the public. Social media has been flooded with clips of health officials lavishing praise on the president, with many viewers expressing frustration and a sense of the experts being ""held hostage.""

""It's really troubling to see these professionals who we should be able to trust just parroting talking points,"" said Samantha Gross, a 32-year-old small business owner in Ohio. ""I want to hear their unvarnished assessments, not some PR fluff.""

As the pandemic drags on with no clear end in sight, the challenge for health officials will be to find a way to provide the public with candid, science-based guidance without jeopardizing their access to the White House and the resources it controls.

""It's a delicate balance, no doubt,"" said Wen. ""But at the end of the day, their duty has to be to the American people, not political expediency. The stakes are simply too high.""",claude
Holi celebrated with face masks and color explosions amid coronavirus fears,"Holi Celebrated with Face Masks and Color Explosions Amid Coronavirus Fears

New Delhi, India – The streets of India were a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors this weekend as the country celebrated the annual Holi festival, a joyous celebration of the arrival of spring. However, this year's festivities were tinged with a sense of caution and uncertainty as the nation grapples with the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Traditionally, Holi is marked by boisterous gatherings, where people throw brightly colored powders and water at one another, often in a raucous display of revelry. But this year, the celebrations were tempered by the need to adhere to social distancing guidelines and other preventive measures against the spread of the coronavirus.

""It's just not the same without the big crowds and the unbridled enthusiasm,"" said Nisha Sharma, a resident of New Delhi. ""We had to be much more mindful of our actions and maintain a safe distance from one another.""

Despite the challenges, the spirit of Holi remained strong, with many revelers finding creative ways to celebrate while prioritizing their health and safety. In some neighborhoods, residents organized small, socially distanced gatherings, where they exchanged greetings and applied colorful powders to each other's faces using long sticks to maintain a safe distance.

""We couldn't have the usual large-scale celebrations, but we still wanted to come together and enjoy the festival,"" said Amit Gupta, a community organizer in the city of Lucknow. ""So, we came up with the idea of using long poles to apply the colors, and it actually added a unique twist to the festivities.""

The government's efforts to curb the spread of the virus also had a significant impact on the Holi celebrations. Many public events and gatherings were canceled or scaled down, and authorities urged people to avoid crowding and maintain proper hygiene practices.

""We understand the importance of Holi, but we also have a responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our citizens,"" said Rajesh Sharma, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs. ""We encouraged people to celebrate the festival in a safe and responsible manner, adhering to the COVID-19 guidelines.""

Despite the precautions, the vibrant colors of Holi could still be seen throughout the country, with many people taking to social media to share their celebrations. However, the predominant images were not of the usual joyous crowds, but rather of individuals or small groups, their faces partially obscured by colorful face masks.

""It's a bittersweet experience,"" said Priya Mehta, a student in Mumbai. ""We're still able to enjoy the festival, but the constant worry about the virus looms over us. It's a reminder that even in the midst of celebration, we must remain vigilant.""

As the country continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, the Holi celebrations this year serve as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the Indian people. While the festivities may have looked different, the underlying spirit of the occasion – a celebration of the triumph of good over evil, and the renewal of life – remained strong.

""Holi is a time for us to come together, to let go of our differences, and to embrace the vibrant colors of life,"" said Nisha Sharma. ""Even in the face of adversity, we will continue to find ways to celebrate and cherish the traditions that bind us as a nation.""",claude
America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down,"America Faces a New Normal as Coronavirus Outbreaks Show No Sign of Slowing Down

In a stark reality check for the nation, the United States is grappling with a surge of COVID-19 cases that show no signs of abating, forcing many Americans to confront the prospect of a ""new normal"" as the pandemic continues to reshape daily life.

Despite months of mitigation efforts and the rollout of vaccines, the highly contagious nature of the Delta variant has fueled a resurgence of infections across the country, straining healthcare systems and prompting the reinstatement of mask mandates and other restrictions in numerous states.

""This is not the summer any of us had hoped for,"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""We are seeing a rapid rise in cases driven by the Delta variant, which is far more transmissible than previous strains.""

The grim reality is that the US is now averaging over 100,000 new COVID-19 cases per day, a level not seen since the winter surge. Hospitalizations have also climbed sharply, with more than 75,000 Americans currently receiving inpatient treatment for the virus.

""The trajectory of this pandemic has taken a very concerning turn,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert. ""We are facing a situation where the unvaccinated are driving the spread, and the vaccinated are still vulnerable to breakthrough infections, though generally with milder symptoms.""

The surge has forced many state and local governments to reimpose mask mandates and other restrictions, undoing much of the progress made earlier this year. In Los Angeles County, for example, all residents are now required to wear masks in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status. Similar measures have been implemented in areas like Washington, D.C., and parts of the San Francisco Bay Area.

""It's incredibly frustrating to be back in this position,"" said Sarah Johnson, a small business owner in Los Angeles. ""I had hoped we were past the worst of this, but now I'm worried about the long-term viability of my company if these restrictions continue.""

The economic impact of the latest wave of infections is also a major concern, with many businesses struggling to adapt to the shifting landscape. Supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and consumer hesitancy have all contributed to an uncertain economic outlook.

""We're in uncharted territory here,"" said Dr. Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandi. ""The pandemic has upended so many aspects of our economy, and there's a real risk of prolonged stagnation if we can't get a handle on this virus.""

Adding to the complexity of the situation is the ongoing debate over vaccine mandates and the role of government in pandemic response. While some argue that more aggressive measures are necessary to curb the spread, others have pushed back against what they see as government overreach.

""This is a delicate balance we're trying to strike,"" said Dr. Fauci. ""We need to protect public health, but we also have to respect individual liberties and the concerns of those who are hesitant about the vaccines.""

As the nation grapples with these challenges, many Americans are left wondering what the future holds. Will the current surge lead to a prolonged period of disruption, or will new strategies and treatments emerge to finally bring the pandemic under control?

""It's hard to say for certain,"" said Dr. Walensky. ""But one thing is clear: we are in this for the long haul, and we all have a role to play in shaping the path forward.""

For now, the message from public health officials is clear: vaccination remains the best defense against the virus, and continued vigilance with mitigation measures like masking and social distancing is crucial to weathering the storm.

""This is our new normal,"" said Dr. Fauci. ""But if we work together, I believe we can overcome this challenge and emerge stronger on the other side.""",claude
An Australian man dies in alleged ax attack near school after 'road rage' incident,"An Australian Man Dies in Alleged Ax Attack Near School After 'Road Rage' Incident

Sydney, Australia - In a shocking incident that has left the local community reeling, a 42-year-old man has been killed in an alleged ax attack near a school in the suburbs of Sydney. The tragic event is believed to have been sparked by a road rage incident, highlighting the dangers of unchecked aggression on the roads.

The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon in the quiet residential neighborhood of Rosehill, just a few blocks away from the local primary school. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the two men, who were previously unknown to each other, engaged in a heated argument that quickly escalated into violence.

""It all happened so fast,"" said Sarah Thompson, a resident who lives nearby. ""I heard shouting and then the sound of an ax striking something. It was absolutely horrific.""

According to the police, the altercation began when the victim, identified as David Emerson, a father of two, reportedly cut off the other driver while navigating the narrow streets near the school. The other driver, a 38-year-old man whose name has not been released, is alleged to have followed Emerson and confronted him on the sidewalk near the school grounds.

""Witnesses reported that the two men engaged in a physical altercation, during which the 38-year-old suspect allegedly used an ax to attack the victim,"" said Detective Inspector Olivia Rawlings of the New South Wales Police Force. ""Tragically, the victim succumbed to his injuries at the scene.""

Emergency services were quickly dispatched, but despite their best efforts, Emerson was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect was apprehended shortly after the incident and is currently in police custody, facing charges of murder.

The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the Rosehill community, with many expressing disbelief and sadness over the senseless loss of life.

""David was a kind, hardworking family man who was loved by everyone in the neighborhood,"" said Emerson's neighbor, Emily Wilkins. ""To think that he was taken from us in such a violent way, all because of a moment of road rage, is just heartbreaking.""

Authorities have assured the public that they are conducting a thorough investigation into the incident and are working to determine the exact sequence of events that led to the fatal confrontation.

""We understand that this is a deeply disturbing and tragic event for the community, and we are committed to uncovering the truth and ensuring that justice is served,"" said Detective Inspector Rawlings.

The incident has also reignited a broader discussion about the growing problem of road rage and the need for greater education and awareness around anger management and conflict resolution on the roads.

""This is a tragic reminder of the potentially devastating consequences of losing one's temper while driving,"" said road safety expert, Dr. Sarah Linden. ""It's crucial that we find ways to promote more responsible and compassionate behavior on our roads, to prevent such senseless acts of violence from occurring in the future.""

As the investigation continues, the Rosehill community has come together to support Emerson's family and to honor his memory. A candlelight vigil is planned for the coming weekend, where residents will gather to mourn the loss of a beloved neighbor and to reflect on the need for greater compassion and understanding on the roads.",claude
The Plot Against AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs vision feels eerily familiar,"The Plot Against America's Vision Feels Eerily Familiar

In a chilling turn of events, the dystopian world depicted in Philip Roth's 2004 novel ""The Plot Against America"" has begun to resonate with an unsettling familiarity in the minds of many Americans. As the country grapples with the ongoing political and social upheaval, the parallels between the fictional narrative and the current state of affairs have become increasingly difficult to ignore.

The novel, which imagines an alternate history where Charles Lindbergh, a prominent aviator and Nazi sympathizer, defeats Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election, paints a disturbing portrait of a nation slowly succumbing to the forces of authoritarianism and anti-Semitism. In this timeline, Lindbergh's administration enacts a series of policies that gradually erode the democratic foundations of the United States, leaving the Jewish community and other minority groups vulnerable to discrimination and persecution.

""The parallels between the novel and the current political climate are truly unsettling,"" said Dr. Emily Walters, a professor of American literature at a leading university. ""The novel's exploration of how a democratic society can be undermined from within, and the normalization of intolerance and xenophobia, feel all too familiar in the context of recent events.""

Indeed, the echoes of ""The Plot Against America"" can be heard in the ongoing debates over immigration, the erosion of democratic norms, and the rise of populist, nationalist movements. The novel's depiction of a government that systematically marginalizes and scapegoats minority groups has drawn comparisons to the rhetoric and policies of certain political figures in the present day.

""It's as if Roth had a crystal ball and was able to foresee the challenges we're facing,"" said John Michaels, a local resident. ""The way the novel portrays the gradual erosion of civil liberties and the normalization of hate-filled rhetoric is chillingly accurate to what we're witnessing in our own society.""

The unsettling parallels have not gone unnoticed by the literary community. Scholars and critics have increasingly turned their attention to the novel, examining its themes and exploring the ways in which it can shed light on the current sociopolitical landscape.

""'The Plot Against America' is a masterful work of fiction that serves as a cautionary tale,"" said Dr. Walters. ""It reminds us that the foundations of democracy are fragile and that we must remain vigilant in defending our values and institutions against those who seek to undermine them.""

As the country continues to grapple with the complex and often divisive issues that have come to the forefront, the resonance of ""The Plot Against America"" has only grown stronger. The novel's depiction of a nation on the brink of authoritarianism has struck a chord with readers, prompting many to reflect on the fragility of democratic systems and the importance of safeguarding the principles of equality, justice, and freedom.

""In a time of such uncertainty and upheaval, it's important that we learn from the cautionary tales of the past,"" said Michaels. ""The Plot Against America' serves as a stark reminder that we must remain vigilant and committed to the ideals that have long defined our nation. If we fail to heed its warnings, we risk the very foundations of our democracy.""

As the conversation surrounding the novel continues to evolve, it is clear that ""The Plot Against America"" has become more than just a work of fiction. It has emerged as a powerful lens through which we can examine the complex realities of the present and the fragility of the democratic systems we hold dear.",claude
90% of people are biased against women. That's the challenge we face,"Groundbreaking Study Reveals Widespread Gender Bias: A Call to Action

In a startling revelation that has sent shockwaves through the global community, a comprehensive study has uncovered a troubling truth: a staggering 90% of people harbor implicit biases against women. This sobering statistic, presented in a report by the respected World Gender Equality Forum, highlights the significant challenges that women continue to face in an ostensibly progressive world.

The study, which involved over 2 million participants from 75 countries, utilized the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure unconscious biases. The IAT is a widely recognized tool that assesses the strength of associations between concepts (such as gender) and evaluations (such as competence) in the human mind.

""The findings are simply staggering,"" said Dr. Emily Saunders, lead researcher on the project. ""The fact that 9 out of 10 people, regardless of their gender, exhibit implicit biases against women is a stark reminder of the deep-seated societal issues we must confront.""

The report delves into the nuances of these biases, revealing that they manifest in a variety of ways. From the automatic assumption that men are more suited for leadership roles to the subconscious perception of women as less competent in traditionally male-dominated fields, these biases have far-reaching consequences.

""This isn't just about overt discrimination,"" Saunders explained. ""These are implicit, often unconscious beliefs that shape our interactions, our decision-making, and our perceptions of the world around us. And that's what makes them so insidious and difficult to address.""

The implications of this study are profound, touching upon every aspect of society, from the workplace and education to politics and media. The report highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to tackle this pervasive issue.

""We can no longer ignore the reality that gender bias is deeply ingrained in our collective psyche,"" said Sarah Wilkins, a prominent gender equality activist. ""This study serves as a wake-up call, not just for individuals, but for institutions, governments, and leaders around the world.""

The report calls for a concerted effort to raise awareness, implement targeted training programs, and foster a culture of open dialogue and self-reflection. Saunders emphasizes the importance of addressing these biases at the societal level, rather than placing the burden solely on women to overcome them.

""It's not enough to simply tell women to 'lean in' or 'be more confident,'"" Saunders said. ""We need to confront the systemic biases that hold them back, and that requires a fundamental shift in how we think and act as a global community.""

The study also highlights the need for increased representation of women in positions of power and influence, as well as the crucial role of media in challenging and dismantling gender stereotypes.

""The media has a responsibility to be a driving force for change,"" said media scholar, Emily Roth. ""By amplifying the voices of women, challenging the status quo, and actively promoting gender equality, we can begin to shift the narrative and pave the way for a more equitable future.""

As the world grapples with the sobering revelations of this groundbreaking study, the call to action is clear: we must come together, across all sectors and communities, to address the pervasive issue of gender bias. Only then can we truly unlock the full potential of women and create a more just, inclusive, and prosperous world for all.",claude
Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response,"Lessons from Ebola: The Secret of Successful Epidemic Response

In the wake of the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which claimed over 11,000 lives between 2014 and 2016, public health experts have been closely examining the factors that contributed to the successful containment of the virus in some regions. A new study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases provides valuable insights into the key elements that enabled certain countries to effectively manage the crisis and limit the spread of the deadly disease.

The research, conducted by a team of epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), highlights the critical role of early intervention, robust public health infrastructure, and effective community engagement in combating infectious disease outbreaks.

""The Ebola epidemic in West Africa was a stark reminder of the importance of being prepared and having the right systems in place to respond to emerging health threats,"" said Dr. Sarah Lim, the lead author of the study and a senior epidemiologist at the WHO. ""Our findings offer valuable lessons that can be applied to strengthen global pandemic preparedness and improve the overall resilience of healthcare systems.""

One of the most striking findings from the study was the significant difference in outcomes between countries that acted swiftly to implement comprehensive control measures and those that were slower to respond. In Senegal and Nigeria, for example, the rapid deployment of trained healthcare workers, the establishment of effective contact tracing systems, and the implementation of targeted public awareness campaigns helped to quickly contain the outbreaks, with only a handful of cases reported in each country.

""The speed of the response was absolutely crucial,"" explained Dr. Lim. ""The longer it takes to identify and isolate cases, trace contacts, and mobilize the necessary resources, the more difficult it becomes to regain control of the situation. The countries that were able to act decisively in the early stages of the outbreak were ultimately the ones that were able to prevent widespread transmission.""

Another key factor that contributed to the successful management of the Ebola crisis in certain regions was the strength and resilience of the public health infrastructure. Countries with well-developed disease surveillance systems, adequate medical facilities, and trained personnel were better equipped to handle the surge in cases and provide effective care to those affected.

""In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the fragility of the healthcare systems was a major hindrance to the response efforts,"" said Dr. Lim. ""Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, and there was a severe shortage of personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and trained staff. This made it extremely challenging to isolate patients, conduct contact tracing, and prevent further transmission within healthcare settings.""

The study also emphasizes the critical importance of community engagement and trust-building in epidemic response. In areas where local leaders and community organizations were actively involved in the implementation of control measures, the researchers observed a higher level of compliance with public health guidelines and a greater willingness to seek medical care.

""Engaging with communities and addressing their concerns and fears was essential,"" explained Dr. Lim. ""In some cases, we saw resistance and mistrust towards the authorities, which hindered the effectiveness of the response. By working closely with local stakeholders and incorporating their input into the decision-making process, we were able to overcome these challenges and ensure a more coordinated and effective response.""

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa serve as a valuable blueprint for strengthening global preparedness and resilience. The study's findings underscore the need for sustained investment in public health infrastructure, the importance of rapid and coordinated response efforts, and the critical role of community engagement in successfully managing infectious disease outbreaks.

""The Ebola crisis was a wake-up call for the global health community,"" concluded Dr. Lim. ""By learning from the successes and failures of the past, we can better equip ourselves to anticipate and respond to future health emergencies, ultimately saving more lives and protecting the well-being of communities around the world.""",claude

The collection, dubbed the ""Quarter Pounder Candle Set,"" features individual candles that mimic the distinct smells of the burger's key components, allowing customers to recreate the dining experience in the comfort of their own homes.

""I'm really curious to see what the Ketchup candle will smell like. I bet it'll be perfect for setting the mood for a nice, juicy burger.""

On the other hand, some individuals have questioned the practicality and appeal of such a product. ""I'm not sure I want my house to smell like a Quarter Pounder all the time,"" said local resident, Michael Nguyen. ""I love the burger, but I don't know if I want that scent lingering around constantly. It might get a bit overpowering.""

Despite the mixed reactions, McDonald's is confident that the Quarter Pounder Candle Set will be a hit with its loyal customer base. The company has stated that the candles will be available for purchase through the McDonald's online store, as well as select retail partners, with a suggested retail price of $25 for the full set.

The company has hinted at the possibility of expanding the scented candle line to include other popular menu items in the future, further diversifying its product offerings beyond the traditional fast-food experience.

Whether the Quarter Pounder Candle Set becomes a runaway success or a quirky novelty, it's clear that McDonald's is willing to think outside the box to engage with its customers and provide them with new and innovative ways to enjoy the flavors they love.",claude

"Son accused of stabbing mother to death, man shot and killed in back-to-back Tacoma homicides","Tacoma Rocked by Violent Back-to-Back Homicides

Tacoma, WA - In a tragic sequence of events, the city of Tacoma was shaken by two separate homicides that occurred within a short span of time on Tuesday evening.

The first incident took place around 7 pm, when police responded to a 911 call reporting a disturbance at a residential address in the North End neighborhood. Upon arrival, officers discovered a woman in her 50s who had sustained multiple stab wounds. Despite immediate medical attention, she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Authorities have identified the victim as Susan Miller, a long-time Tacoma resident. According to initial reports, Miller's own son, 28-year-old Michael Miller, is the prime suspect in her murder.

""This is a heartbreaking situation for everyone involved,"" said Tacoma Police Chief, John Doe. ""Our deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of the victim. We are working diligently to understand the circumstances that led to this tragedy.""

Neighbors expressed shock and disbelief at the news, describing the Miller family as quiet and seemingly close-knit. ""They kept to themselves, but they always seemed like a normal, loving family,"" said Sarah Johnson, who lives across the street. ""I can't imagine what could have happened to cause something like this.""

Police have not yet released details about the motive or the events leading up to the stabbing. Michael Miller was apprehended at the scene and is currently in custody, facing charges of first-degree murder.

Just over an hour later, at approximately 8:15 pm, a second 911 call reported gunshots in the South End neighborhood, several miles away from the initial incident.

"It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President","It's Time to Let the Experts Do Their Jobs, Mr. President

In a strongly worded statement released earlier today, a coalition of leading public health experts and medical professionals called on the White House to take a step back and allow the nation's top scientists to guide the federal response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The statement, signed by over 100 renowned epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, and public health officials, expressed deep concern over what they described as the Trump administration's ""continued interference and disregard for scientific consensus"" in its handling of the health crisis.

""For months now, we have witnessed a troubling pattern of political considerations taking precedence over the advice and recommendations of the very experts charged with protecting the health and safety of the American people,"" the statement read. ""It is time for this to end.""

The experts went on to cite numerous examples of the administration's dismissal or overruling of guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other leading public health authorities. This includes the recent controversy surrounding the CDC's updated testing guidelines, which many public health experts have criticized as being influenced by political pressure rather than scientific evidence.

""The politicization of public health is a dangerous road to go down,"" said Dr. Emily Landon, chief infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Chicago Medicine. ""When scientific consensus is ignored or distorted for political gain, it erodes public trust and undermines our ability to effectively respond to this crisis.""

The experts' statement also took issue with the president's repeated downplaying of the pandemic, his promotion of unproven treatments, and his opposition to measures such as mask-wearing and lockdowns that have been shown to reduce virus transmission.

""Time and again, we have seen the president and his allies spread misinformation and contradict the advice of public health professionals,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""This is not only irresponsible, but it puts lives at risk.""

The signatories of the statement called on the administration to ""immediately cease its efforts to undermine the scientific community"" and to instead empower public health experts to lead the nation's COVID-19 response. They urged the president to follow the guidance of the CDC, the NIH, and other leading institutions, and to make decisions based on the best available evidence rather than political considerations.

""Our nation is facing an unprecedented public health crisis, and now more than ever, we need steady, science-based leadership,"" the statement concluded. ""It is time for the president to step aside and let the experts do their jobs.""

The White House has not yet issued a formal response to the experts' statement. However, in recent weeks, the president has continued to downplay the severity of the pandemic and has pushed for a faster reopening of the economy, even as many states have seen a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.

As the nation heads into the fall and winter months, when public health experts warn of a potential ""second wave"" of the virus, the battle over the role of science in the COVID-19 response is likely to intensify. The outcome of this struggle could have profound implications for the health and well-being of millions of Americans.",claude
"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, Nation's Largest

By [Assistant's Name], Reporter

NEW YORK, NY - As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the United States, New York City is facing increasing pressure to close its public school system, the largest in the nation. With over 1.1 million students enrolled, the decision to shutter the city's schools would have far-reaching implications for families, educators, and the broader community.

The call to close New York City's schools comes amidst a surge in COVID-19 cases throughout the city. On [current date], the number of confirmed cases in New York reached [X], with the majority concentrated in the five boroughs. Health officials have warned that the city is quickly becoming the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, raising concerns about the ability of the healthcare system to cope with the influx of patients.

""The situation in New York City is extremely concerning,"" said Dr. [Name], an epidemiologist at [University/Institution]. ""The rapid increase in cases, coupled with the density of the population, makes it critical for the city to take decisive action to limit the spread of the virus.""

One of the most significant measures under consideration is the closure of the city's public schools. Mayor [Name] has faced mounting pressure from parents, teachers, and public health experts to take this step, which would affect over 1.1 million students across the five boroughs.

""Closing the schools is a difficult decision, but it's one that we have to seriously consider,"" said Mayor [Name] during a press conference on [date]. ""The health and safety of our students, teachers, and staff is our top priority, and we are exploring all options to protect our community.""

The potential closure of New York City's schools would have far-reaching consequences. Millions of families would be forced to make alternative arrangements for their children, potentially disrupting work schedules and creating financial hardships. Additionally, the closure would impact the availability of essential services, such as free meals and childcare, that many students rely on.

""For a lot of our students, the school is a safe haven, a place where they can access critical resources and support,"" said [Name], a teacher at [School] in the Bronx. ""Closing the schools would be a devastating blow, not just for their education, but for their overall well-being.""

The decision to close the schools is further complicated by the diversity of the New York City public school system. With students from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, the impact of a closure would be uneven, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.

""We have to consider the unique needs of our student population,"" said [Name], the president of the United Federation of Teachers. ""Closing the schools would disproportionately affect low-income families and students with special needs, who rely on the resources and services provided by the school system.""

As the pressure to close the schools mounts, city officials are exploring alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. These include implementing remote learning options, providing childcare for essential workers, and ensuring the continued delivery of essential services to students and families.

""We are working around the clock to find solutions that protect the health and well-being of our community while minimizing the disruption to our students' education,"" said Mayor [Name]. ""This is an unprecedented challenge, but we are committed to doing everything in our power to support our families and our city.""

The decision to close the New York City public school system, the largest in the nation, will have far-reaching consequences. As the city grapples with the growing threat of the coronavirus pandemic, the pressure to take this drastic step continues to mount, with the potential to reshape the educational landscape for millions of students and their families.",claude
My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"""My Argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion)""

In a surprising turn of events, legal scholar and former Supreme Court clerk John Doe has come forward with a firsthand account of a heated exchange with the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Doe, who worked under Scalia's tutelage in the late 1990s, claims the revered jurist engaged in a fiery debate over the interpretation of the Constitution that left a lasting impact.

Doe, now a professor of law at a prestigious university, recounts the incident in vivid detail. ""It was during a private meeting in Justice Scalia's chambers,"" Doe recalls. ""I had been tasked with researching a particular case that was pending before the Court, and I had developed a perspective that differed from Scalia's well-known originalist approach.""

According to Doe, the discussion began cordially, with Scalia inquiring about Doe's analysis of the case. ""I presented my findings, outlining how I believed the Constitution should be interpreted in a more modern, contextual manner. To my surprise, Justice Scalia immediately took issue with my stance.""

Doe says Scalia launched into a passionate defense of his originalist philosophy, arguing that the Framers' original intent should be the guiding principle for constitutional interpretation. ""He was adamant that straying from the text and historical understanding would undermine the integrity of the document,"" Doe recounts.

The exchange quickly escalated, with both men engaging in a spirited debate, each determined to defend their respective positions. ""Justice Scalia was not one to mince words,"" Doe says. ""He accused me of being a 'judicial activist' and of trying to 'rewrite the Constitution to fit [my] own political agenda.'""

Doe, known for his own scholarly prowess, held his ground, challenging Scalia's assertions and arguing that the Constitution must evolve to address modern societal needs. ""I countered that the Framers intentionally crafted a document that could be interpreted flexibly, to account for changing times and circumstances,"" Doe explains.

The confrontation, according to Doe, reached a crescendo when Scalia, visibly agitated, declared, ""The Constitution is not a living, breathing document. It means what it meant when it was ratified, and that's the end of it."" Doe says he responded by questioning whether such an inflexible approach could truly uphold the principles of democracy and individual rights.

While the debate ultimately reached an impasse, Doe maintains that the exchange left a profound impact on his own legal philosophy and approach to constitutional interpretation. ""Justice Scalia's unwavering commitment to originalism was both admirable and, in my view, deeply flawed,"" Doe reflects. ""His refusal to consider alternative perspectives, even from his own clerks, was troubling.""

In the years since the incident, Doe has continued to grapple with the complexities of constitutional interpretation, often drawing on his experience with Scalia as a touchstone for his own scholarly work. ""The clash of ideas that day challenged me to think more critically about the role of the judiciary and the delicate balance between fidelity to the Constitution and the need for adaptability,"" Doe says.

Doe's account of his argument with the late Justice Scalia provides a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the Supreme Court and the passionate debates that often shape the course of constitutional jurisprudence. As the legal community continues to grapple with the legacy of Scalia's originalist approach, Doe's personal experience serves as a reminder of the importance of intellectual discourse and the ongoing quest to interpret the foundational document that governs the United States.",claude
How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution,"NASA's Apollo Program Fueled Silicon Valley's Tech Revolution

In the 1960s, the race to the Moon sparked a technological revolution that would shape the future of computing and innovation. As NASA's Apollo program pushed the boundaries of what was possible, its ripple effects were felt far beyond the space industry, laying the groundwork for the meteoric rise of Silicon Valley.

The Apollo program's insatiable demand for cutting-edge technology and engineering prowess spurred the development of a wide range of innovations that would later find their way into the consumer market. From powerful microprocessors to advanced software, the technologies pioneered during the space race paved the way for the personal computer revolution and the birth of the modern tech industry.

""The Apollo program was a crucible for innovation,"" says Dr. Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist who played a pivotal role in the Moon landings. ""The sheer scale and complexity of the challenge forced us to push the boundaries of what was technologically feasible at the time.""

One of the most significant contributions of the Apollo program was the advancement of integrated circuit technology. In the early 1960s, NASA's need for smaller, more reliable electronics drove the rapid development of microchips, which were essential for the guidance and control systems of the Saturn V rockets and the Apollo spacecraft.

""The integrated circuit was still a relatively new and untested technology when NASA came calling,"" explains Dr. Robert Noyce, co-founder of Intel and a pioneer of the semiconductor industry. ""But the Apollo program's insatiable demand for these microchips accelerated their refinement and mass production, paving the way for their widespread adoption in consumer electronics.""

The Apollo program also played a crucial role in the evolution of software engineering. As the complexity of the spacecraft and mission control systems grew, NASA needed new approaches to manage and coordinate the vast amounts of data and calculations required for a successful Moon landing.

""The software challenges posed by the Apollo program were unlike anything that had been attempted before,"" says Dr. Margaret Hamilton, who led the team that developed the onboard flight software for the Apollo missions. ""We had to create entirely new programming languages and methodologies to handle the scale and real-time demands of the mission.""

These innovations in software engineering would later find their way into the commercial sector, laying the foundation for the development of modern operating systems, programming languages, and enterprise software.

Beyond the technical advancements, the Apollo program also had a profound impact on the culture and mindset of the emerging tech industry in Silicon Valley. The program's focus on ambitious, collaborative problem-solving and its willingness to take risks inspired a generation of engineers and entrepreneurs.

""The Apollo program showed us that with the right combination of talent, resources, and determination, we could achieve the seemingly impossible,"" says Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple. ""That spirit of innovation and risk-taking became the driving force behind the tech revolution that would transform the world.""

As the Apollo program reached its culmination with the historic Moon landings, the technologies and mindset it had fostered began to spread throughout the tech industry. Engineers and scientists who had honed their skills on the space program started to apply their expertise to a wide range of commercial ventures, from personal computers to telecommunications.

""The Apollo program didn't just produce technological breakthroughs – it also produced a new generation of leaders and innovators who would go on to shape the future of computing and technology,"" says Dr. Vinton Cerf, a computer scientist and one of the ""fathers of the internet.""

Today, the legacy of the Apollo program can be seen in every aspect of our digital world, from the smartphones in our pockets to the global networks that connect us. The technological revolution it sparked continues to reverberate through the tech industry, serving as a testament to the power of ambitious, collaborative problem-solving.",claude
"I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me","""I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me""

By Emily Watkins, Health Reporter

In a powerful op-ed published last week, Emily Johnson, a 34-year-old woman living with multiple sclerosis, called on Congress to take urgent action to protect the rights and wellbeing of Americans with chronic illnesses. Johnson's plea highlights the struggles faced by the millions of people in the U.S. living with debilitating, lifelong conditions.

""As someone who has had to fight tooth and nail for access to the care and treatments I need, I'm pleading with our elected officials to step up and make real changes,"" Johnson wrote. ""Too many of us are one medical crisis away from financial ruin, and that's simply unacceptable in the wealthiest nation on Earth.""

Johnson is far from alone in her experience. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 6 in 10 adults in the United States have a chronic disease, and 4 in 10 have two or more. These conditions, which include heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders, are the leading causes of death and disability in the country.

For those living with chronic illnesses, the challenges are multifaceted and often overwhelming. In addition to the physical and emotional toll of managing a lifelong condition, many also face significant financial burdens due to the high costs of healthcare.

""I've had to make tough choices between paying for my medications or putting food on the table,"" Johnson shared. ""No one should have to decide between their health and their financial security.""

This is where Congress can and must step in, advocates say. One of the key priorities is strengthening and expanding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA has provided crucial protections for people with pre-existing conditions, allowing them to access affordable health insurance regardless of their medical history.

However, the future of the ACA remains uncertain, with ongoing legal and political battles threatening to undermine or even dismantle the landmark healthcare law. Lawmakers must act to safeguard the ACA's provisions and ensure that Americans with chronic illnesses can continue to rely on this vital safety net.

Another area of concern is the high cost of prescription drugs. Many people with chronic conditions require expensive, specialized medications to manage their symptoms and prevent complications. Congress can address this issue by empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping out-of-pocket costs for patients, and incentivizing the development of generic and biosimilar alternatives.

Additionally, advocates are calling for improved access to mental healthcare services. Chronic illness can take a significant toll on an individual's mental health, leading to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and other psychological challenges. By ensuring that comprehensive mental health coverage is included in all insurance plans and expanding access to telehealth services, Congress can help support the overall wellbeing of those living with chronic conditions.

""It's not just about the physical aspects of my disease,"" Johnson explained. ""The emotional and mental health impacts are just as debilitating, and they need to be addressed with the same level of urgency.""

Lastly, Johnson and other advocates are urging Congress to strengthen workplace protections for people with chronic illnesses. This includes ensuring that employers cannot discriminate against individuals based on their medical status and that they provide reasonable accommodations, such as flexible schedules or the ability to work remotely, to enable those with chronic conditions to maintain their employment.

""Having a stable job and income is crucial for managing my healthcare costs and maintaining my quality of life,"" Johnson said. ""No one should have to choose between their health and their livelihood.""

As Congress grapples with a packed legislative agenda, the voices of those living with chronic illnesses must be heard. The wellbeing and financial security of millions of Americans hang in the balance, and lawmakers have a moral obligation to act swiftly and decisively to address this pressing public health crisis.",claude
South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation,"South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation

Wuhan, China - As the deadly coronavirus outbreak continues to spread in Wuhan, China, a group of South African citizens trapped in the city are urgently calling for their government to evacuate them.

The group, which includes students, teachers, and other professionals, say they feel abandoned and are growing increasingly concerned for their safety as the lockdown in Wuhan tightens.

""We're really scared and just want to get out of here as soon as possible,"" said 24-year-old university student Jessica Nkosi. ""The situation is getting worse every day, and we don't know how long we can hold out.""

Nkosi, who has been studying in Wuhan for the past two years, said the past week has been a nightmare, with the city in virtual shutdown as authorities try to contain the rapidly spreading virus.

""We're not allowed to leave our apartment building, and there's a severe shortage of food and other supplies,"" she said. ""We're relying on the kindness of our Chinese neighbors to bring us what we need.""

Another South African, 32-year-old teacher Themba Mabena, said the uncertainty of the situation is taking a heavy toll.

""We don't know how long this lockdown is going to last, and we're running out of options,"" he said. ""I have a young family here, and we're all very worried about our safety and wellbeing.""

Mabena said he has been in regular contact with the South African embassy in Beijing, but claims they have been slow to respond to the urgency of the situation.

""They keep telling us they're working on it, but we need action, not just promises,"" he said. ""We need to be evacuated as soon as possible before it's too late.""

The South African government has acknowledged the plight of its citizens in Wuhan and says it is exploring options for their evacuation.

""We are deeply concerned about the welfare of our citizens in Wuhan and are working closely with Chinese authorities to facilitate their safe return to South Africa,"" said Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor.

Pandor said the government is considering a range of options, including chartering a flight to evacuate the South Africans, but cautioned that any such operation would be logistically challenging and would need to be coordinated with Chinese officials.

""The safety and wellbeing of our citizens is our top priority, but we also need to ensure that any evacuation efforts do not put them or others at further risk,"" she said.

In the meantime, the trapped South Africans say they are doing their best to stay positive and support one another, but the strain is taking a heavy toll.

""We're trying to stay strong, but it's really hard,"" said Nkosi. ""We just want to be back home with our families, safe and sound.""

As the coronavirus outbreak continues to escalate, the plight of the South Africans in Wuhan has become a growing concern for their government and the international community. With the situation in the city growing more dire by the day, the calls for their urgent evacuation are only likely to grow louder in the coming days and weeks.",claude
Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates

New York, NY - Wall Street staged a remarkable rebound on Tuesday, with major indexes posting significant gains following the previous day's staggering losses. The turnaround came as investors sought to recoup some of the steep declines that shook global markets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1,167 points, or 4.9%, at 24,912. The S&P 500 index rose 4.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 4.9%. The rally was broad-based, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing the day in positive territory.

""Today's gains are a welcome sight after the historic plunge we witnessed yesterday,"" said Emily Ramirez, a senior market analyst at XYZ Financial. ""Investors seem to be regaining some confidence, though volatility is likely to persist in the near term.""

The rebound was fueled by a combination of factors, including bargain hunting, short-covering, and reassurances from policymakers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pledged that the central bank would ""act as appropriate to support the economy,"" sparking hopes of potential interest rate cuts or other interventions.

""The Fed's commitment to supporting the economy has given investors some much-needed reassurance,"" said Ramirez. ""However, the underlying concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth remain, and we're likely to see continued market swings in the coming days and weeks.""

Sectors that were hit particularly hard in Monday's sell-off, such as energy and financials, led the charge higher on Tuesday. Energy stocks, as measured by the S&P 500 Energy Index, surged 7.3%, while the S&P 500 Financials Index climbed 5.4%.

""The bargain hunting we're seeing today is focused on the sectors that were most heavily punished in the previous session,"" said Ramirez. ""Investors are clearly looking for opportunities to scoop up beaten-down stocks at discounted prices.""

Despite the rebound, market analysts caution that the road ahead remains uncertain. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to disrupt global supply chains and economic activity, and the long-term impact on corporate earnings and consumer spending remains unclear.

""While today's rally is certainly a welcome respite, we're not out of the woods yet,"" said Ramirez. ""Investors need to brace for continued volatility as the situation with the coronavirus unfolds.""

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely watching for any further developments on the virus front, as well as any additional policy responses from central banks and governments around the world.

""The next few weeks and months will be crucial in determining the trajectory of the global economy and financial markets,"" said Ramirez. ""Investors would be wise to remain vigilant and prepared for the possibility of more turbulence ahead.""",claude
Asking yourself 'What's the meaning of life?' may extend it,"Asking Yourself 'What's the Meaning of Life?' May Extend It

In a groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers have found that regularly pondering the fundamental questions of human existence may have significant benefits for longevity.

The study, conducted by a team of psychologists and sociologists from several leading universities, followed a diverse group of over 10,000 participants for more than 20 years. Participants were asked to report the frequency with which they engaged in what the researchers termed ""existential contemplation"" – the active consideration of questions such as ""Why am I here?"", ""What is the purpose of life?"", and ""What happens after we die?""

The results were striking. Individuals who reported engaging in existential contemplation at least once per week were found to have a 15% lower risk of mortality compared to those who rarely or never pondered such questions. This effect held true even after controlling for factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions.

""We were quite surprised by the strength of the relationship,"" said Dr. Emily Rosen, the study's lead author. ""It seems that the simple act of regularly reflecting on the deeper meaning of our lives may have a tangible impact on longevity.""

Rosen and her team propose several potential mechanisms to explain this phenomenon. One hypothesis is that existential contemplation fosters a greater sense of purpose and meaning, which in turn promotes healthier behaviors and better emotional well-being – both of which are known to positively influence lifespan.

""When people engage in this kind of deep, philosophical thinking, they often come to the realization that their lives have value and significance,"" Rosen explained. ""This can lead to a heightened motivation to take care of oneself, both physically and mentally.""

Additionally, the researchers suggest that the act of contemplating life's big questions may stimulate cognitive activity and reduce the risk of age-related mental decline. ""Grappling with these profound issues requires a level of mental engagement that may help maintain brain health and function over time,"" Rosen said.

The study's findings have already generated significant interest in the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a potential breakthrough in the understanding of the relationship between psychological factors and physical health.

""This research really challenges the traditional biomedical model of longevity, which has tended to focus primarily on physical factors like diet, exercise, and access to healthcare,"" said Dr. Sarah Watkins, a gerontologist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The idea that something as intangible as philosophical contemplation could have such a measurable impact on lifespan is truly fascinating.""

However, Watkins and other researchers caution that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the observed effects and to determine whether the findings can be replicated in diverse populations.

""While these results are certainly intriguing, we need to be cautious about drawing definitive conclusions,"" Watkins said. ""It's possible that there are other factors, such as socioeconomic status or pre-existing psychological conditions, that could be influencing the relationship between existential contemplation and longevity.""

Nevertheless, the study's authors remain optimistic about the potential implications of their work. Rosen believes that the findings could inspire new approaches to promoting healthy aging and longevity, potentially even leading to the development of interventions aimed at encouraging regular existential contemplation.

""If something as simple as regularly reflecting on the meaning of life can have such a profound impact, then we may have uncovered a powerful, yet underutilized, tool for improving human health and well-being,"" Rosen said. ""Of course, more research is needed, but the possibilities are truly exciting.""",claude
New packaging and plant-based fish: How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback,"New Packaging and Plant-Based Fish: How Bumble Bee Tuna is Trying to Make a Comeback

In a bid to revitalize its brand and appeal to changing consumer preferences, Bumble Bee Foods, one of the largest canned tuna producers in the United States, has announced a major overhaul of its product lineup and packaging.

The company, which has struggled with declining sales and a tarnished reputation in recent years, is now focusing on two key strategies to regain its footing in the highly competitive seafood market: a redesigned can and the introduction of a new plant-based tuna alternative.

Revamped Packaging
Bumble Bee's iconic blue and yellow cans have been a staple on grocery store shelves for decades, but the company recognized the need to modernize its appearance to better resonate with younger consumers.

""Our previous packaging felt dated and didn't effectively communicate the quality and freshness of our products,"" said Bumble Bee's Chief Marketing Officer, Sarah Johnson. ""We wanted to create a more contemporary, eye-catching design that would jump out at shoppers and better showcase the brand's heritage and commitment to sustainability.""

The new cans feature a sleek, minimalist aesthetic with bold, clean typography and a simplified Bumble Bee logo. The company has also introduced a range of vibrant, nature-inspired color schemes, including ocean blue, tropical green, and sunset orange, to appeal to health-conscious consumers.

""We conducted extensive consumer research to understand what resonates with today's tuna buyers,"" Johnson explained. ""The feedback was clear – they wanted packaging that felt more premium, modern, and aligned with their values around sustainability and environmental responsibility.""

Plant-Based Tuna Alternative
In addition to the packaging refresh, Bumble Bee is making a bold move into the rapidly growing plant-based seafood market with the launch of its new ""Bumble Bee Tuno"" product line.

Developed in partnership with a leading food technology company, Bumble Bee Tuno is made from a proprietary blend of plant-based ingredients, including soy, pea protein, and seaweed extracts, designed to mimic the taste and texture of traditional canned tuna.

""As consumer preferences continue to shift towards more sustainable and plant-based protein options, we recognized the need to diversify our product portfolio and offer alternatives that cater to these evolving dietary trends,"" said Bumble Bee's CEO, Chris Lischewski.

The Tuno products will be available in a variety of flavors, including classic albacore, lemon pepper, and sriracha, and can be used in the same way as conventional canned tuna, such as in sandwiches, salads, and casseroles.

""We're really excited about the potential of Bumble Bee Tuno to attract a new generation of consumers who are looking for delicious, plant-based seafood options,"" Lischewski added. ""It's a major step forward in our efforts to reinvent the brand and stay relevant in an increasingly competitive market.""

Challenges and Opportunities
The company's rebranding and product diversification efforts come at a critical time for the tuna industry, which has faced a range of challenges in recent years, including declining consumption, concerns over sustainability and mercury levels, and increased competition from alternative protein sources.

""Bumble Bee has recognized that it needs to adapt to these changing market conditions if it wants to remain a dominant player in the seafood aisle,"" said industry analyst, Emily Walters. ""The new packaging and plant-based offerings are a clear attempt to attract younger, health-conscious consumers who may have been turned off by the brand's previous image.""

However, Walters also cautioned that the success of Bumble Bee's turnaround strategy is far from guaranteed, as the company will need to navigate a crowded plant-based seafood market and overcome lingering perceptions about the sustainability and safety of its traditional tuna products.

""Bumble Bee is certainly taking a risk with these bold moves, but if executed well, they could pay off in a big way,"" Walters said. ""The tuna giant has a lot riding on this reinvention, and the industry will be watching closely to see if it can reclaim its spot as a leading player in the seafood space.""",claude
Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,"Discarded Photo Negatives Show China in an Era of Change

In a remarkable discovery, a trove of discarded photo negatives has shed new light on China's transformation during a pivotal period in its history. The negatives, found in a remote village, offer a rare glimpse into the country's social and economic landscape in the 1980s and 1990s, a time of significant transition.

The collection, which includes hundreds of images, was stumbled upon by a local historian who was conducting research in the area. ""At first, I thought they were just ordinary negatives, but as I began to examine them more closely, I realized the incredible historical value they held,"" said the historian, who wished to remain anonymous.

The negatives, which appear to have been abandoned by a local photographer, capture a wide range of subjects, from bustling city streets to rural landscapes, showcasing the country's rapid urbanization and industrialization during this era.

One striking image depicts a crowded market scene in a major city, with vendors hawking a diverse array of goods, from traditional Chinese wares to modern consumer products. ""This image really highlights the growing consumer culture that was taking hold in China at the time,"" said the historian. ""It's a testament to the country's shift towards a more market-oriented economy.""

Another noteworthy photograph shows a group of factory workers assembling what appears to be electronic components, underscoring the country's burgeoning manufacturing sector and its role as the ""world's factory.""

The collection also includes several images of rural villages, offering a glimpse into the lives of China's agricultural communities during a period of significant change. ""These photos provide a valuable counterpoint to the urban-centric narratives that often dominate our understanding of China's development,"" the historian noted.

One particularly poignant image shows a family gathered around a small television set, a symbol of the country's growing access to modern technology and media. ""This image really captures the sense of optimism and excitement that many Chinese people felt as their country began to open up to the world,"" the historian said.

The discovery of these negatives has generated significant interest among historians and scholars, who believe they could shed new light on China's transformation during a critical juncture in its history.

""These photos offer a unique, ground-level perspective on the changes that were sweeping through China at the time,"" said Dr. Mei Li, a professor of Chinese history at a leading university. ""They provide a valuable complement to the official narratives and statistical data that are often used to study this period.""

The historian who discovered the negatives is currently working to digitize and preserve the collection, with plans to eventually make it available to researchers and the general public. ""It's an incredible treasure trove that deserves to be shared with the world,"" the historian said.

As the global community continues to grapple with the implications of China's rapid rise, these discarded photo negatives offer a poignant reminder of the profound social and economic changes that have shaped the country's trajectory over the past few decades.",claude
Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates

New York, NY - Wall Street rebounded strongly on Tuesday, with major indexes posting significant gains, a day after suffering their worst single-day losses since the 2008 financial crisis.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up over 1,000 points, or 5%, at 21,237. The S&P 500 gained 4.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 5.6%. The rally came as a welcome relief to investors after Monday's rout, which saw the Dow plummet over 2,000 points, or 7.8%, in its largest one-day point drop on record.

""It's been a wild 24 hours on Wall Street, but this rebound shows the market is trying to find its footing,"" said Samantha Chen, senior market analyst at XYZ Financial. ""Investors are clearly still on edge, but the positive momentum today is a step in the right direction.""

The gains were broad-based, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing the day in positive territory. Technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary stocks were among the best performers, each rising more than 5%. Energy was the only sector to lag, climbing a more modest 2.7% as oil prices remained under pressure.

Driving the comeback was a combination of bargain-hunting, short-covering, and growing optimism that policymakers will take further steps to mitigate the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

""There's a sense that the market may have overreacted a bit to the virus news, and investors are now looking for opportunities to get back in at lower prices,"" said Mark Wilkins, chief investment officer at ABC Wealth Management. ""Plus, the expectation of additional stimulus from the Federal Reserve and Congress is giving people more confidence.""

Indeed, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell released a statement earlier in the day pledging that the central bank would ""use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."" Meanwhile, the White House is reportedly considering various fiscal policy measures, including a payroll tax cut, to bolster the economy.

However, analysts warned that the market's recovery remains fragile, and volatility is likely to persist in the near term as the full impact of the coronavirus on the global economy becomes clearer.

""This is probably not the end of the roller coaster ride,"" said Chen. ""Investors should expect more ups and downs as the situation surrounding the virus continues to evolve.""

The market's wild swings have been driven in large part by the rapid spread of the coronavirus outside of China, which has fueled fears of a widespread pandemic and its potential to disrupt supply chains, travel, and consumer spending.

On Tuesday, the World Health Organization officially declared the outbreak a global pandemic, underscoring the severity of the crisis. The number of confirmed cases worldwide has surpassed 121,000, with the death toll exceeding 4,300.

In the U.S., the number of reported cases has climbed to over 1,000, with at least 31 deaths. Several states, including California, New York, and Washington, have declared states of emergency, and many schools, businesses, and public events have been shut down or canceled.

Despite the market's rebound, investors remain on edge, and the road ahead is likely to be bumpy.

""This is uncharted territory, and there's still a lot of uncertainty about how this is going to play out,"" said Wilkins. ""Volatility is going to be the name of the game for the foreseeable future.""",claude
Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump

In a move that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, Democratic leaders have concluded that the only viable path forward is to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. This decision comes after months of investigations and growing concerns over the president's conduct in office.

The catalyst for this dramatic shift was the release of a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival. The complaint, which has been corroborated by a rough transcript of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, has led many Democrats to believe that the president has abused his power for personal political gain.

""The president's actions have left us with no choice but to pursue impeachment,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement. ""We have a solemn duty to uphold the Constitution and protect the integrity of our democratic institutions.""

Pelosi's announcement marks a significant departure from her previous reluctance to pursue impeachment, a move that she had long resisted due to concerns about the potential political fallout. However, the mounting evidence of wrongdoing, combined with growing pressure from the party's progressive wing, has apparently convinced her that impeachment is now the only viable option.

""This is not a decision we have made lightly,"" Pelosi continued. ""But the president's actions have left us no other choice. We must act to preserve the rule of law and protect our democracy.""

The impeachment inquiry will be led by the House Intelligence Committee, which has already subpoenaed the whistleblower complaint and plans to hear testimony from key administration officials in the coming weeks. The committee will investigate whether Trump's actions constitute an impeachable offense, such as abuse of power or obstruction of Congress.

If the House ultimately votes to impeach the president, the process would then move to the Senate, where a trial would be held to determine whether to remove Trump from office. Given the Republican majority in the Senate, it is widely believed that the president would ultimately be acquitted. However, the mere act of impeachment would still carry significant political and symbolic weight.

""This is a solemn moment for our country,"" said Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. ""We must put partisan politics aside and focus on upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. The American people deserve the truth, and they deserve a president who respects the office and the democratic process.""

The White House has responded to the impeachment inquiry with defiance, accusing the Democrats of engaging in a ""witch hunt"" and a ""coup attempt."" Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the impeachment process tooth and nail.

""This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""All of this over a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine. Ridiculous!""

Despite the administration's pushback, many political analysts believe that the evidence against Trump is simply too overwhelming to ignore. The president's own words, captured in the rough transcript of the call with Zelensky, appear to directly contradict his claims of innocence.

""This is not a partisan issue,"" said political scientist James Thurston. ""The president's actions, if proven true, represent a clear abuse of power and a violation of the public trust. Impeachment is the only appropriate response, regardless of party affiliation.""

As the impeachment process moves forward, the nation will be watching closely to see how the drama unfolds. The stakes could not be higher, as the future of the presidency and the integrity of American democracy hang in the balance.",claude
The real terror threat in America is homegrown,"The Real Terror Threat in America is Homegrown

In the wake of recent high-profile attacks, a concerning trend has emerged - the growing threat of homegrown terrorism within the United States. While international extremist groups have long been a focus of national security efforts, experts warn that the most pressing danger may now lie within America's own borders.

""The threat landscape has shifted significantly in recent years,"" says counterterrorism analyst Emily Garrison. ""Whereas we once primarily grappled with foreign-directed plots, we are now seeing a surge in self-radicalized individuals carrying out attacks inspired by extremist ideologies.""

Data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) paint a troubling picture. Over the past five years, more than 70% of terrorist incidents in the U.S. have been perpetrated by American citizens or legal residents, a marked increase from previous decades.

""The internet and social media have played a major role in this trend,"" explains Professor Aisha Rahman, a terrorism studies scholar. ""Extremist groups have become adept at leveraging online platforms to radicalize and recruit vulnerable individuals, often without ever meeting them in person.""

Recent high-profile cases illustrate the scope of the problem. In 2021, a 19-year-old from Ohio was arrested for planning to attack a synagogue, having been inspired by white supremacist ideology he encountered online. Just last month, a 22-year-old from California carried out a mass shooting at a local food festival, motivated by a toxic mix of anti-government sentiments and racial animus he had absorbed from fringe internet communities.

""These individuals often fly under the radar until it's too late,"" laments FBI Special Agent Michael Donovan. ""They don't fit the traditional profile of a terrorist, which makes them incredibly difficult to detect and prevent.""

Complicating matters further, experts warn that the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated the problem. Prolonged social isolation, economic hardship, and the proliferation of misinformation have created a perfect storm for radicalization, with vulnerable individuals seeking solace and purpose in extremist ideologies.

""The pandemic has undoubtedly played a role in fueling this trend,"" says DHS analyst Sarah Walters. ""We've seen a marked increase in tips and referrals related to domestic terrorism since 2020, as more people have fallen down the rabbit hole of online conspiracy theories and hate speech.""

In response, government agencies and civil society organizations have ramped up efforts to counter the threat of homegrown terrorism. Initiatives such as the DHS's ""If You See Something, Say Something"" campaign aim to encourage public vigilance and reporting of suspicious activity. Meanwhile, tech companies have faced mounting pressure to more effectively police their platforms and curb the spread of extremist content.

However, some critics argue that these efforts fall short, calling for a more comprehensive and proactive approach.

""We need to address the root causes of radicalization, not just the symptoms,"" says community organizer Liam Nguyen. ""That means investing in mental health resources, educational programs, and initiatives that foster social cohesion and resilience within marginalized communities.""

As the nation grapples with this evolving threat, experts agree that a multipronged strategy is essential. Strengthening intelligence-gathering, improving early intervention, and engaging with local communities will all be crucial in the fight against homegrown terrorism.

""This is a complex and daunting challenge, but one that we must confront head-on,"" concludes Garrison. ""The safety and security of our citizens depend on our ability to address this threat, before it's too late.""",claude
The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"The Real Story Behind Those Planned Parenthood Videos

In the summer of 2015, a series of undercover videos surfaced that purported to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue. The videos, released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, quickly went viral and sparked a national controversy, with many Republican lawmakers calling for an investigation into the women's healthcare provider.

However, a closer examination of the facts reveals a much more complex and nuanced story behind these controversial videos.

The videos were heavily edited, according to multiple independent analyses. Forensic video experts found that the clips had been deceptively manipulated, with some footage spliced together from different conversations to create the impression of wrongdoing. Planned Parenthood has maintained that the organization does not profit from fetal tissue donation, which is legal in some states, and that any payments received were to cover the costs of the donation process.

""These videos were clearly edited to misrepresent Planned Parenthood's practices and policies,"" said Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation. ""The full, unedited footage shows that Planned Parenthood follows all applicable laws and ethical guidelines when it comes to fetal tissue donation.""

Indeed, investigations by several states and the U.S. House of Representatives have failed to uncover any evidence of illegal activity by Planned Parenthood. In fact, a congressional panel tasked with investigating the group concluded that the videos were ""deceptively edited"" and did not show any wrongdoing.

""Planned Parenthood has been providing safe, legal, and essential healthcare to millions of people for decades,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""These attacks are part of a long-standing effort to undermine access to reproductive healthcare and spread misinformation about the work we do.""

The controversy surrounding the videos has also highlighted the broader political and ideological battle over abortion rights in the United States. Many anti-abortion activists have seized on the videos as a rallying cry to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides a wide range of healthcare services, including abortions.

""This is not about the videos anymore – it's about a concerted effort to undermine access to safe, legal abortion,"" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. ""These attacks are part of a larger strategy to chip away at reproductive rights and limit women's choices.""

Planned Parenthood has faced increased threats and violence in the wake of the video controversy. In 2015, a gunman attacked a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, killing three people. And in 2022, the organization reported a significant increase in threats and harassment against its staff and patients.

""The real story here is not about the videos, but about the ongoing efforts to restrict access to reproductive healthcare and demonize Planned Parenthood,"" said Dr. Wen. ""We must continue to fight for the right of all people to make their own decisions about their bodies and their futures.""

As the debate over the Planned Parenthood videos continues, it is clear that the truth is far more complex than the sensational headlines would suggest. The real story is one of a long-standing ideological battle over abortion rights and the ongoing struggle to ensure access to essential healthcare services for all.",claude

Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"Elon Musk's Brother Wants to Transform Farming

In a bold move to revolutionize the agricultural industry, Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of tech mogul Elon Musk, has unveiled his ambitious plans to reshape the future of farming. Kimbal, a successful entrepreneur in his own right, has set his sights on tackling the pressing challenges facing the global food system.

Kimbal Musk's vision for the future of farming centers around his non-profit organization, The Kitchen Community, which he co-founded in 2011. The organization's mission is to bring fresh, sustainable, and locally-sourced produce to communities across the United States, with a particular focus on underserved areas.

""The current industrial food system is broken,"" Kimbal Musk stated in a recent interview. ""It's contributing to a host of environmental and health issues, and it's leaving too many people without access to nutritious, affordable food. We need to rethink the way we grow, distribute, and consume food.""

To achieve this transformation, Kimbal Musk is spearheading the development of a network of ""Learning Gardens"" – small-scale, community-based farms that provide hands-on educational opportunities for students and residents. These gardens are designed to teach sustainable farming practices, promote healthy eating habits, and foster a deeper connection between people and the food they consume.

""Our Learning Gardens are more than just farms,"" Kimbal explained. ""They're hubs of community engagement, where people can learn, collaborate, and take an active role in shaping the future of their local food systems.""

The success of The Kitchen Community's Learning Gardens has caught the attention of policymakers and industry leaders alike. Several cities and school districts have partnered with the organization to integrate the gardens into their educational curricula, and Kimbal Musk has been invited to speak at various agricultural and sustainability conferences.

But Kimbal's vision extends beyond the Learning Gardens. He is also working to develop a network of ""vertical farms"" – high-tech, indoor farming facilities that use advanced hydroponic and aeroponic systems to grow produce year-round, without the need for soil or pesticides.

""Vertical farming has the potential to revolutionize the way we grow food,"" Kimbal said. ""By taking agriculture indoors and using cutting-edge technology, we can dramatically increase yields, reduce water and land usage, and bring fresh, nutritious produce to urban areas that currently lack access to it.""

Kimbal's vertical farming initiative, known as Square Roots, has already attracted significant investment and partnerships with major food retailers. The company aims to establish a network of vertical farms in cities across the United States, providing a sustainable and localized source of fresh produce.

""The key to transforming our food system is to empower people at the local level,"" Kimbal emphasized. ""By giving communities the tools and knowledge to grow their own food, we can create a more resilient, equitable, and environmentally-friendly food system.""

While Kimbal Musk's ambitious plans have garnered widespread attention and praise, he acknowledges that the road ahead will not be without its challenges. Scaling up the Learning Gardens and vertical farming initiatives will require significant investment, policy changes, and overcoming entrenched industry interests.

""We're up against a deeply entrenched and powerful industrial agriculture system,"" Kimbal admitted. ""But I believe that by bringing people together, fostering innovation, and demonstrating the power of community-based, sustainable farming, we can create the change that's so desperately needed.""

As Elon Musk continues to push the boundaries of technology and innovation, his brother Kimbal is quietly working to transform the way we grow, distribute, and consume food. With his unwavering commitment to sustainable agriculture and community empowerment, Kimbal Musk is poised to leave an indelible mark on the future of farming.",claude
Which generation has it worse? (Opinion),"Which Generation Has It Worse? (Opinion)

In the ongoing debate over the challenges facing different generations, the question of ""which generation has it worse"" continues to be a source of contention. As younger and older generations grapple with their respective struggles, it's essential to examine the nuances and complexities of this multifaceted issue.

For many millennials, the narrative of a ""lost generation"" has become all too familiar. Saddled with student loan debt, facing a competitive job market, and navigating the high costs of housing and healthcare, this generation has faced significant financial hurdles. A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that millennials are the first generation in modern history to have lower levels of wealth and income than their parents had at the same age.

""It's incredibly frustrating to see how much harder it is for us to achieve the same milestones our parents did,"" says Emily Nguyen, a 32-year-old marketing professional. ""We're working just as hard, if not harder, but the goalposts keep moving further away.""

In contrast, some argue that the challenges facing baby boomers, the generation born between 1946 and 1964, are equally daunting. As they approach retirement age, many boomers find themselves ill-prepared, with insufficient savings and the looming specter of rising healthcare costs. The recent economic turbulence, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has only compounded these concerns.

""We worked hard our entire lives, but now we're facing the prospect of a retirement that may not be as secure as we had hoped,"" says 65-year-old retired teacher, Sarah Williamson. ""The cost of living keeps going up, and our savings just don't seem to stretch as far as they used to.""

The debate over which generation has it worse is further complicated by the unique challenges faced by Generation Z, the cohort born between 1997 and 2012. This generation has come of age during a period of unprecedented global upheaval, from the COVID-19 pandemic to the ongoing climate crisis. The impact of these events on their education, employment prospects, and mental health has been significant.

""We're the ones who have to pick up the pieces and figure out how to navigate a world that feels increasingly uncertain,"" says 20-year-old college student, Liam Gonzalez. ""It's overwhelming to think about the challenges we'll have to face in the years to come.""

Ultimately, the question of ""which generation has it worse"" is not one with a simple answer. Each generation faces its own unique set of challenges, shaped by economic, social, and political factors. While it's tempting to engage in generational comparisons, it's important to recognize that the experiences of individuals within each generation can vary greatly.

""It's not about pitting one generation against another,"" says sociologist Dr. Emily Rosen. ""The reality is that different generations are facing different obstacles, and it's important to understand the nuances and complexities of each situation.""

As we navigate these generational divides, the key may lie in fostering greater empathy, understanding, and collaboration across age groups. By recognizing the shared struggles and unique challenges faced by each generation, we can work towards creating a more equitable and supportive society for all.",claude
Photographer Daniel Arnold visits the center and sidelines of the world's largest gem show,"Photographer Daniel Arnold Captures the Vibrant Scenes of the World's Largest Gem Show

Tucson, Arizona - As the sun rises over the Sonoran Desert, crowds begin to gather at the Tucson Convention Center, eager to immerse themselves in the captivating world of gemstones and minerals. This is the annual Tucson Gem and Mineral Show, the largest of its kind, drawing thousands of collectors, enthusiasts, and industry professionals from across the globe.

At the heart of this spectacle is photographer Daniel Arnold, whose lens has captured the essence of this vibrant event for the past several years. ""The Tucson Gem Show is a kaleidoscope of colors, textures, and stories,"" Arnold says. ""It's a place where the extraordinary and the mundane collide, creating a visual feast that's both dazzling and deeply human.""

Arnold's journey through the show begins in the bustling outdoor vendor tents, where rows of tables are adorned with an array of glistening treasures. ""The energy is palpable as dealers haggle and negotiate, each trying to secure the most prized specimens,"" he observes. ""It's a dance of passion, expertise, and the thrill of the hunt.""

As he weaves through the crowds, Arnold's camera captures the intricate details that make this event so captivating. From the weathered hands of a seasoned mineral collector carefully examining a rare quartz formation to the wide-eyed wonder of a first-time attendee, his images convey the diverse perspectives and experiences that converge at the Tucson Gem Show.

But Arnold's lens doesn't just focus on the gems themselves; it also explores the stories of the people who bring them to life. ""Behind each stunning specimen, there's a tale of discovery, exploration, and sometimes, even adventure,"" he explains. ""I'm fascinated by the personal journeys that have led these individuals to this moment, and I strive to convey that in my work.""

One such story belongs to Samantha Greenfield, a third-generation gem dealer whose family has been a fixture at the Tucson Gem Show for decades. ""My grandfather started coming here back in the 1960s,"" she says, her eyes sparkling with pride. ""It's where he built his business and passed on his passion for these incredible natural wonders to my father and me.""

As Arnold documents Greenfield's interactions with customers, her infectious enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the industry become evident. ""This show is more than just a marketplace,"" she reflects. ""It's a gathering of kindred spirits, a place where we can share our love for these captivating stones and learn from one another.""

Beyond the bustling vendor tents, Arnold's camera also captures the quieter moments that unfold at the show. In the conference rooms and lecture halls, he documents the exchange of ideas, the sharing of expertise, and the sense of community that permeates the event.

""The Tucson Gem Show is not just about buying and selling,"" Arnold explains. ""It's a hub of learning, collaboration, and the pursuit of knowledge. You can feel the intellectual energy in the air as people come together to discuss the latest advancements in gemology, mineralogy, and the preservation of these natural wonders.""

As the sun sets on another day at the Tucson Gem Show, Arnold reflects on the privilege of being able to document this extraordinary event. ""It's a privilege to be able to capture the essence of this incredible gathering,"" he says. ""The Tucson Gem Show is a testament to the enduring human fascination with the natural world, and I'm honored to be able to share these stories with a wider audience.""",claude
Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout,"Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout

Washington, D.C. - After days of intense negotiations, congressional leaders and the White House appear to be closing in on a new economic stimulus package to provide relief to Americans and businesses reeling from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The development comes as Wall Street has been gripped by a renewed sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging over 1,000 points on Wednesday amid fears of a prolonged economic downturn.

According to sources familiar with the talks, the emerging deal is expected to include a range of measures, including direct payments to most American adults, an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits, and tens of billions in aid for small businesses, airlines, and state and local governments.

""There is a genuine sense of urgency to get something done,"" said one senior congressional aide who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""The economic pain is acute, and both sides know they need to act.""

The negotiations have been complicated by longstanding partisan divisions, with Democrats pushing for a more comprehensive package and Republicans seeking a more targeted approach. However, the worsening economic conditions appear to be driving both sides toward a compromise.

""We're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to be done,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Wednesday. ""The American people are counting on us to get this right.""

The potential deal comes as Wall Street has been rocked by renewed volatility, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 943 points, or 3.4%, on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also fell sharply, reflecting growing concerns about the trajectory of the economic recovery.

Analysts pointed to a range of factors contributing to the sell-off, including the surge in COVID-19 cases across the country, the lack of progress on a new stimulus package, and the looming uncertainty around the presidential election.

""Investors are clearly spooked by the combination of rising virus cases, political gridlock, and the potential for a contested election outcome,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""That's creating a perfect storm of uncertainty that is weighing heavily on the markets.""

The renewed market turmoil underscores the fragility of the economic recovery and the urgent need for policymakers to provide additional support, experts said.

""Without a doubt, the economy is in a precarious position right now,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. ""Households and businesses are struggling, and the risk of a double-dip recession is very real if Congress and the White House don't act quickly.""

The potential stimulus deal, if reached, would mark a significant victory for both the Trump administration and congressional leaders, who have faced mounting pressure to break the months-long deadlock and deliver much-needed aid to the American people.

However, the details of the agreement remain fluid, and it's unclear whether the two sides will be able to overcome their differences and secure a final deal in the coming days.

""This is a critical moment for our country,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). ""We must put politics aside and focus on the needs of the American people. The stakes are simply too high to fail.""",claude
"South Korea has 'passed the peak' of the coronavirus outbreak, health minister hopes","South Korea Has 'Passed the Peak' of the Coronavirus Outbreak, Health Minister Hopes

Seoul, South Korea - In a glimmer of hope amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, South Korea's Health Minister Park Neung-hoo expressed cautious optimism that the country has ""passed the peak"" of its outbreak.

""We believe the country has passed the peak of the outbreak,"" Park said during a press briefing on Wednesday. ""But we cannot be complacent as new cases are still being reported.""

South Korea was one of the first countries outside of China to experience a significant outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The country saw a rapid surge in cases in late February, with the daily number of new infections peaking at 909 on February 29.

However, the country has since managed to flatten the curve through an aggressive testing and contact tracing program, as well as strict social distancing measures. As of Wednesday, South Korea has reported a total of 10,384 confirmed cases and 200 deaths.

""The speed of the increase in new cases has slowed significantly,"" Park noted. ""We will continue to maintain our current response posture to ensure we can bring the outbreak under control.""

Despite the positive signs, health officials warned that the battle against COVID-19 is far from over. Park cautioned that the government would need to maintain its vigilance to prevent a resurgence of the virus.

""We cannot let our guard down,"" he said. ""There is still a possibility of another wave of infections, so we must remain prepared.""

One of the key factors behind South Korea's relative success in containing the outbreak has been its extensive testing and contact tracing efforts. The country has conducted over 440,000 tests, giving it one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world.

""Our ability to quickly identify and isolate infected individuals has been crucial,"" said Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We have been able to trace and test the contacts of confirmed cases, which has helped us get ahead of the virus.""

In addition to testing, South Korea has also implemented strict social distancing measures, including the closure of schools and businesses, as well as a ban on mass gatherings. The government has also provided financial support to individuals and businesses affected by the outbreak.

""We have taken a comprehensive approach to tackling this crisis,"" Jeong said. ""It's been a team effort, with the government, healthcare system, and the public all working together.""

Despite the positive signs, health officials cautioned that the country is not out of the woods yet. They warned that a resurgence of the virus could still occur, particularly as the country begins to ease some of its social distancing measures.

""We must remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidelines,"" Park said. ""We cannot afford to become complacent, as that could undo all the progress we have made.""

As the global community continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, South Korea's experience offers a glimmer of hope that the outbreak can be brought under control with a comprehensive and coordinated response. However, the country's health minister was quick to emphasize that the battle is far from over, and that continued vigilance and cooperation will be crucial in the weeks and months ahead.",claude

March 1 coronavirus news,"March 1 Coronavirus News: Cases Continue to Rise Globally, New Restrictions Implemented in Some Countries

(New York, NY) - As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the global community is closely monitoring the latest developments. On March 1st, several key updates emerged regarding the spread of the coronavirus and the ongoing efforts to mitigate its impact.

Surge in Cases Reported Worldwide
According to data compiled by health authorities, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has continued to rise across the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of over 105 million cases globally as of March 1st, representing a significant increase from the previous week.

""The virus is still very much present and active in many parts of the world,"" said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's COVID-19 technical lead. ""We are seeing sustained transmission in several countries, and the emergence of new variants is also a major concern that we are closely tracking.""

The United States, which has been one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, recorded over 28 million confirmed cases as of March 1st. Meanwhile, Europe has also experienced a surge in infections, with several nations implementing new restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.

New Measures Introduced in Europe
In response to the rising case numbers, some European countries have introduced additional measures to control the pandemic.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the extension of the country's lockdown measures until March 28th. This includes the closure of non-essential businesses, a limit on social gatherings, and the requirement for employers to allow employees to work from home whenever possible.

""The situation remains serious,"" Merkel said during a press conference. ""While we have seen some progress, the number of new infections is still too high, and the spread of new variants poses a significant threat.""

Similarly, France has extended its nationwide curfew, which now runs from 6 PM to 6 AM in most regions. President Emmanuel Macron has also warned that further restrictions may be necessary if the situation does not improve.

""We are in a race against time,"" Macron said. ""The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether we can avoid a third national lockdown.""

Vaccination Efforts Continue
As governments around the world work to contain the spread of the virus, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines remains a top priority. Many countries have been ramping up their vaccination programs, with the goal of inoculating as many people as possible.

In the United States, the Biden administration has set a target of administering 100 million vaccine doses in the first 100 days of the president's term. As of March 1st, over 75 million doses have been distributed, and more than 53 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

""The vaccination effort is progressing, but we still have a long way to go,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President. ""It's crucial that we continue to follow public health guidelines, even as more people get vaccinated, to prevent further spread of the virus.""

Similar vaccination campaigns are underway in other parts of the world, with varying degrees of success. The WHO has called for a more equitable distribution of vaccines, particularly to low-income countries that have struggled to secure adequate supplies.

Looking Ahead
As the global community continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, experts emphasize the importance of remaining vigilant and following public health guidance. The emergence of new variants, the ongoing strain on healthcare systems, and the economic impact of the crisis all underscore the need for continued collective efforts to overcome this challenge.

""We are in a critical phase of the pandemic,"" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO. ""We must remain united and committed to the fight against COVID-19, as the path ahead is still uncertain and fraught with challenges.""",claude
How NBA led in the sports world shutdown,"How NBA Led in the Sports World Shutdown

In a move that sent shockwaves across the sports landscape, the National Basketball Association (NBA) made the unprecedented decision to suspend its season indefinitely on March 11, 2020, in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. This bold action by the league not only had a profound impact on the basketball world but also served as a catalyst for the broader shutdown of professional and amateur sports globally.

The catalyst for the NBA's decision came when Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the novel coronavirus, just moments before a scheduled game between the Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder. In an immediate and decisive move, the league chose to postpone the game and subsequently announced the suspension of the entire season.

""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,"" the league said in a statement at the time.

This move by the NBA was widely praised by public health experts and government officials, who recognized the importance of taking swift action to limit the spread of the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, lauded the league's decision, stating that it ""set the tone"" for other sports organizations to follow suit.

""The NBA acted quickly and responsibly in suspending their season,"" Fauci said. ""This was a crucial step in mitigating the further spread of the virus and protecting the health and safety of both players and fans.""

In the days and weeks that followed, the NBA's decision had a domino effect on the sports world. Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the National Football League, and countless other professional and collegiate leagues quickly announced the postponement or cancellation of their seasons, tournaments, and events.

""The NBA's decision was a wake-up call for the entire sports industry,"" said sports marketing expert John Smith. ""It showed that even the most powerful and lucrative leagues were not immune to the threat of COVID-19, and that drastic measures were necessary to protect the well-being of everyone involved.""

The impact of the sports shutdown was felt far beyond the playing fields and arenas. Countless businesses and industries that rely on the sports economy, such as ticket sales, merchandise, and hospitality, were left reeling from the sudden loss of revenue.

""The sports shutdown was a massive blow to our local economy,"" said Jane Doe, the mayor of a mid-sized city with a professional sports franchise. ""Thousands of jobs were lost, and the ripple effects were felt throughout our community.""

Despite the significant challenges posed by the sports shutdown, the NBA and other leagues have worked tirelessly to find ways to safely resume their operations. The NBA, in particular, has been praised for its innovative ""bubble"" concept, which allowed the league to complete its 2019-20 season and crown a champion, the Los Angeles Lakers, amid the ongoing pandemic.

""The NBA's bubble was a remarkable achievement, demonstrating the league's commitment to public health and its ability to adapt to the rapidly changing circumstances,"" said sports analyst Sarah Johnson.

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, the sports industry remains in a state of flux. However, the decisive actions taken by the NBA in the early days of the pandemic have left a lasting impact, serving as a model for how sports organizations can prioritize the well-being of their players, staff, and fans while navigating the challenges of a global health crisis.",claude
Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"Are Female Urinals the Answer to Queues at the Loos?

In a move that could revolutionize the public restroom experience, a growing number of venues are experimenting with the installation of female urinals. This innovative solution aims to address the persistent problem of long queues for women's restrooms, a common frustration experienced in various settings, from concert halls to sporting events.

The concept of female urinals, also known as ""she-urinals"" or ""ladyironts,"" is not entirely new, but it has gained renewed attention in recent years as a practical way to improve restroom accessibility and efficiency. Unlike traditional toilet stalls, these specialized units allow women to urinate in a standing position, similar to the way men use urinals.

""The idea behind female urinals is to provide a quicker and more convenient option for women,"" explains Dr. Sarah Linden, a public health expert and advocate for inclusive restroom design. ""By offering this alternative, we can potentially reduce wait times and alleviate the often-frustrating experience of long queues in women's restrooms.""

Proponents of female urinals argue that the technology can have a significant impact, particularly in high-traffic venues where the disparity in restroom facilities between genders is most pronounced. ""It's not uncommon for women to wait 20 minutes or more to use the restroom, while the men's line moves much faster,"" says Jane Doe, a frequent concertgoer. ""Having the option of a female urinal could make a real difference in my overall experience.""

The installation of female urinals is already underway in various locations, with early adopters including concert halls, sports stadiums, and even some large office buildings. The response from users has been generally positive, with many reporting a noticeable reduction in wait times and a more efficient restroom experience.

""I was skeptical at first, but after trying out the female urinal, I was pleasantly surprised,"" says Sarah Smith, a young professional who works in a large corporate office. ""It's clean, discreet, and I was able to get in and out much quicker than I would have with a traditional stall. It's a game-changer for busy workplaces like ours.""

However, the introduction of female urinals has not been without its challenges. Some critics have raised concerns about privacy, hygiene, and the overall comfort level of users. There are also questions about the appropriate placement and design of these units to ensure accessibility and inclusivity.

""We need to be mindful of the cultural and personal sensitivities surrounding the use of female urinals,"" says Dr. Linden. ""It's important to ensure that the design and implementation of these facilities prioritize the needs and preferences of the users, while also addressing any legitimate concerns about privacy and hygiene.""

As the concept of female urinals continues to gain traction, manufacturers and venue operators are working to address these concerns through innovative design solutions and comprehensive user education. Some female urinals now feature privacy screens, adjustable water pressure, and intuitive user instructions to create a more comfortable and hygienic experience.

""It's all about finding the right balance between efficiency and user comfort,"" says Jane Doe. ""If the female urinals can provide a quicker and more convenient option without compromising on privacy or cleanliness, I think they could be a game-changer for women's restroom experiences.""

As the debate around female urinals continues, it remains to be seen whether this innovative solution will become a widespread and accepted feature in public restrooms. However, with the growing demand for more equitable and efficient restroom facilities, the future of female urinals may be brighter than one might expect.",claude
Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak,"Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the Cartoonists Who Helped Take Down Najib Razak

In the tumultuous political landscape of Malaysia, two individuals have emerged as unlikely heroes - Zunar and Fahmi Reza, two prominent political cartoonists whose scathing satire and unyielding criticism played a crucial role in the downfall of former Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Zunar, whose real name is Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque, is a renowned cartoonist known for his bold and incisive critiques of the Malaysian government. For years, he has used his art as a powerful tool to expose corruption, nepotism, and abuse of power within the political establishment. His cartoons, often depicting Najib Razak and his associates in unflattering and compromising situations, have been a thorn in the side of the ruling party.

Fahmi Reza, on the other hand, is a graphic designer and activist who has leveraged social media to amplify his message. His provocative posters and memes, which frequently mock the government and its leaders, have resonated with a younger generation of Malaysians who are disillusioned with the status quo.

Together, Zunar and Fahmi Reza have become the voices of dissent, using their creative talents to challenge the narrative propagated by the government and to rally the public against the corruption and mismanagement that had plagued the country for years.

The turning point came in 2015, when the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal erupted, revealing a massive financial scandal that implicated Najib Razak and his associates. As the scandal unfolded, Zunar and Fahmi Reza were at the forefront of the public outcry, using their art to amplify the calls for Najib's resignation and accountability.

Zunar's cartoons, which depicted Najib Razak swimming in a pool of money or being handcuffed by authorities, became viral sensations, shared and discussed across social media platforms. Fahmi Reza, on the other hand, created a series of memes that parodied the government's attempts to downplay the 1MDB scandal, further fueling public outrage.

The impact of their work was undeniable. As the 1MDB scandal continued to dominate the headlines, Najib Razak's popularity plummeted, and the public's trust in his leadership eroded. The cartoonists' relentless attacks on the government's corruption and mismanagement played a significant role in mobilizing the public and galvanizing the opposition.

In the 2018 general election, the opposition coalition, led by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, pulled off a stunning upset, defeating Najib Razak's Barisan Nasional coalition. The victory was seen as a triumph for the people, a rejection of the corruption and cronyism that had plagued the country for decades.

In the aftermath of the election, Zunar and Fahmi Reza were hailed as heroes, their art credited with helping to catalyze the political change that swept through Malaysia. Zunar, who had faced numerous arrests and legal challenges for his work, was finally able to express his creativity without fear of repercussions.

Fahmi Reza, on the other hand, continued to use his platform to hold the new government accountable, leveraging his social media presence to keep the pressure on and ensure that the promises of reform were kept.

Today, Zunar and Fahmi Reza remain prominent figures in the Malaysian political landscape, using their art and activism to champion the cause of good governance, transparency, and accountability. Their story is a testament to the power of creativity and the ability of individuals to effect meaningful change in the face of entrenched political interests.

As Malaysia continues to navigate the complexities of its post-Najib era, the legacy of Zunar and Fahmi Reza serves as a reminder that the pen, and the brush, can be mightier than the sword in the fight for a better, more just society.",claude
A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst,"A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage communities worldwide, there is growing concern over the potential for widespread outbreaks within the incarcerated population. Prisons and jails, with their often cramped living conditions and limited access to healthcare, have become hotspots for the virus, presenting a unique challenge for authorities tasked with containing its spread.

In recent months, several high-profile outbreaks have highlighted the vulnerability of these institutions. In Ohio, the Marion Correctional Institution reported over 2,000 positive cases, accounting for nearly 80% of the prison's population. Similarly, the Pickaway Correctional Institution saw more than 1,600 inmates test positive, making it one of the largest known COVID-19 clusters in the United States.

""Prisons are essentially petri dishes for the virus,"" said Dr. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for the New York City jail system. ""The confined spaces, poor ventilation, and lack of access to basic hygiene make them breeding grounds for infectious diseases.""

To address this pressing issue, experts and policymakers have proposed a range of measures to safeguard the health and well-being of incarcerated individuals, as well as the staff who work in these facilities.

One key recommendation is the widespread implementation of COVID-19 testing and screening protocols. By regularly testing both inmates and staff, authorities can quickly identify and isolate positive cases, preventing the virus from spreading rapidly through the prison population.

""Early detection is crucial,"" explained Dr. Venters. ""The sooner you can identify and isolate infected individuals, the better your chances of containing the outbreak before it spirals out of control.""

In addition to testing, advocates have called for the increased use of compassionate release and early parole programs. By reducing prison populations, these measures can alleviate overcrowding and allow for more effective social distancing measures to be implemented.

""We've seen how quickly the virus can spread in these confined spaces,"" said John Smith, a criminal justice reform advocate. ""Reducing the number of incarcerated individuals is a critical step in mitigating the risks of a full-blown prison pandemic.""

Another area of focus has been the improvement of sanitation and hygiene practices within correctional facilities. This includes the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to both inmates and staff, as well as the implementation of rigorous cleaning and disinfection protocols.

""Prisons often lack the resources and infrastructure to maintain proper hygiene standards,"" said Dr. Venters. ""Providing inmates with access to soap, hand sanitizer, and other cleaning supplies can go a long way in preventing the spread of the virus.""

Experts also emphasize the importance of addressing the unique mental health challenges faced by incarcerated individuals during the pandemic. With visitation restrictions and the cancellation of rehabilitation programs, many inmates are experiencing increased levels of stress, anxiety, and isolation.

""The psychological toll of the pandemic on the incarcerated population cannot be overstated,"" said Dr. Emily Harrington, a prison mental health specialist. ""Offering comprehensive mental health support and maintaining connections with the outside world are crucial for maintaining the well-being of those behind bars.""

As the pandemic continues to evolve, the need for a comprehensive, coordinated response to the crisis in the nation's prisons and jails has never been more pressing. By implementing these measures and prioritizing the health and safety of the incarcerated population, authorities can work to prevent the worst-case scenario of a full-blown prison pandemic.

""The stakes are high, but we have the tools and the knowledge to address this challenge head-on,"" said Dr. Venters. ""It's time for us to take decisive action and protect one of the most vulnerable populations in our society.""",claude
SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"SE Cupp: A Third Party Could Get Us Out of This Mess

In a bold move that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, prominent political commentator and television host SE Cupp has called for the establishment of a viable third party in the United States. Cupp, known for her independent and often contrarian views, believes that the current two-party system has become increasingly polarized and dysfunctional, and that a new political force is needed to break the deadlock and address the pressing issues facing the country.

""The American people are tired of the constant bickering and partisan gridlock that has come to define our political system,"" Cupp said in a recent interview. ""They want leaders who are willing to put the country's interests ahead of their own party's interests, and who are capable of finding common ground and working together to solve problems.""

Cupp's call for a third party has been met with a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism from political observers. Proponents argue that a new party could inject much-needed fresh ideas and perspectives into the political discourse, while also providing an alternative to the perceived excesses of both the Democratic and Republican parties.

""The two-party system has become increasingly entrenched, with both sides digging in and refusing to compromise,"" said Dr. Emily Thorson, a political science professor at Syracuse University. ""A third party could potentially disrupt this dynamic and force the major parties to rethink their strategies and policies.""

Critics, however, argue that the creation of a viable third party would be an uphill battle, given the structural and financial advantages enjoyed by the Democratic and Republican parties. They also warn that a third party could potentially split the vote and hand victory to the least-preferred candidate, as has happened in the past.

""The history of third-party movements in the United States is not a particularly encouraging one,"" said Dr. John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University. ""The winner-take-all nature of our electoral system makes it very difficult for a third party to gain traction and win elections.""

Nonetheless, Cupp remains undeterred, arguing that the current political climate demands bold action. She has called for a grassroots movement to build support for a new party, one that would be focused on pragmatic problem-solving and a commitment to bipartisanship.

""We need to move beyond the partisan gridlock and the endless cycle of division and recrimination,"" Cupp said. ""A third party could provide a platform for a new generation of leaders who are willing to put the country first and work together to address the real challenges we face.""

Cupp's proposal has already garnered significant attention, with several prominent figures from both the left and the right expressing cautious support for the idea. However, the path forward remains uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether a viable third party can emerge in the current political landscape.

Regardless of the outcome, Cupp's call for a third party has sparked a much-needed conversation about the state of American politics and the need for fresh approaches to address the country's most pressing challenges. As the 2024 election cycle begins to take shape, the prospect of a third party could become an increasingly prominent feature of the political landscape.",claude
'We are not alone': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy,"""'We are not alone': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy

MILAN, Italy - As the global coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, Italy remains one of the countries hit hardest, with over 80,000 confirmed cases and more than 8,000 deaths as of late March. In an effort to contain the outbreak, the Italian government has imposed strict nationwide lockdown measures, restricting the movement of the country's 60 million citizens.

Under the lockdown, all non-essential businesses and activities have been ordered to close, and Italians are only permitted to leave their homes for essential reasons such as work, health, or grocery shopping. Public gatherings of any kind are prohibited, and travel between cities and regions has been severely limited.

For many Italians, the abrupt shift to this new, isolated way of living has been a major adjustment. ""It's like we're living in a science fiction movie,"" said Maria Rossi, a 42-year-old office worker in Milan. ""One day we were going about our normal lives, and the next, everything just stopped.""

Despite the hardships, however, Rossi and others say they understand the necessity of the lockdown measures. ""We know this is all for our own safety and the safety of our loved ones,"" she explained. ""It's not easy, but we have to do what we have to do.""

Indeed, a sense of unity and community spirit has emerged across Italy as citizens band together to support one another through this challenging time. Up and down the country, people have been finding creative ways to stay connected while staying apart.

In the evenings, neighbors in apartment buildings have taken to their balconies to sing patriotic songs and share meals together. Social media has also become a vital lifeline, with Italians using platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp to organize virtual social events, fitness classes, and even birthday parties.

""We may be physically isolated, but we are not alone,"" said Rossi. ""Knowing that we're all in this together, that we're supporting each other, makes a big difference.""

For many, the lockdown has also provided an opportunity to slow down and reflect. ""I've been spending a lot more time with my family, cooking meals together, playing games,"" said Alessandro Ferretti, a 29-year-old from Rome. ""It's made me realize how much I took those simple pleasures for granted before.""

At the same time, the lockdown has presented significant challenges, particularly for those living alone or caring for young children. ""It can be really lonely and isolating, especially when you can't see your friends and loved ones in person,"" said Rossi. ""And trying to work from home with two young kids running around is a constant battle.""

The economic impact of the lockdown has also been devastating, with many businesses forced to close and millions of Italians facing unemployment or reduced incomes. The government has introduced various relief measures, including cash payments and tax deferrals, but the long-term effects on the economy remain uncertain.

Despite the hardships, however, Italians remain resilient and determined to get through this crisis together. ""We've been through so much as a country - wars, natural disasters, economic crises,"" said Ferretti. ""And every time, we've come out stronger. This will be no different.""

As the lockdown continues, with no clear end in sight, Italians are finding solace in the small moments of joy and connection that have emerged. Whether it's singing on balconies, sharing recipes online, or simply taking the time to appreciate the simple pleasures of life, they are proving that even in the darkest of times, the human spirit can shine through.

""We are not alone,"" said Rossi. ""And we will get through this, together.""",claude
Fraudsters get hefty prison terms for impersonating French minister,"Fraudsters Get Hefty Prison Terms for Impersonating French Minister

Paris, France - In a landmark case that has sent shockwaves through the financial world, two individuals have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms for their elaborate scheme of impersonating a high-ranking French government official.

The defendants, identified as 42-year-old Jean-Luc Dupont and 38-year-old Émilie Mercier, were found guilty of fraud, money laundering, and abuse of public office after a months-long investigation by French authorities.

According to court documents, the pair had orchestrated a complex web of deception, posing as the French Minister of Finance, Bruno Le Maire, in order to siphon millions of euros from unsuspecting victims.

""This was a sophisticated and audacious scheme that exploited the trust and goodwill of the public,"" said Judge Isabelle Dupont, who presided over the case. ""The defendants used their criminal cunning to manipulate and deceive, causing significant financial and reputational harm to their victims.""

The court heard how Dupont and Mercier had meticulously crafted a network of shell companies, forged documents, and fake social media profiles to lend an air of legitimacy to their impersonation. They then used these fabricated identities to solicit investments and secure lucrative contracts, all the while funneling the illicit funds into their own personal accounts.

""These individuals abused their positions of power and authority to commit egregious acts of fraud,"" said Prosecutor Émilie Legrand. ""They betrayed the trust of the French people and undermined the integrity of our financial institutions. Their actions deserve the harshest possible punishment.""

The sentencing, which took place earlier this week, has been widely praised by legal experts and anti-corruption advocates. Dupont was handed a 12-year prison sentence, while Mercier received a 10-year term. Additionally, the court ordered the forfeiture of their assets, estimated to be worth over €25 million.

""This case serves as a stark warning to those who would seek to exploit the public's trust for their own personal gain,"" said Transparency International France's Éric Duvall. ""The French government has demonstrated its unwavering commitment to combating financial crimes and holding perpetrators accountable, no matter their position or influence.""

The investigation, which was led by the French Financial Prosecutor's Office and the National Gendarmerie's Central Office for the Fight against Corruption and Financial and Fiscal Offenses, involved close cooperation with international law enforcement agencies.

""This was a complex and challenging case, but our team was determined to uncover the truth and bring these criminals to justice,"" said Gendarmerie Colonel Luc Bertrand. ""We hope that this sentence sends a clear message that such blatant disregard for the law will not be tolerated.""

The fallout from the scandal has already begun to reverberate throughout the French political and financial landscape. Several high-profile figures have called for a comprehensive review of the government's anti-fraud measures, while others have demanded the resignation of senior officials who may have been complicit in the scheme.

""The public's trust in our institutions has been seriously eroded by this incident,"" said political analyst Émilie Dupré. ""The government must act swiftly and decisively to restore confidence and ensure that such brazen acts of fraud never occur again.""

As the dust settles, the victims of the scheme continue to grapple with the emotional and financial toll of the ordeal. Many have expressed relief at the harsh sentences handed down to Dupont and Mercier, but acknowledge that the road to recovery will be a long and arduous one.

""These criminals have destroyed so much,"" said one victim, who wished to remain anonymous. ""They've taken away our sense of security and our faith in the system. We can only hope that this serves as a wake-up call and that the authorities will work tirelessly to prevent such atrocities from happening again.""",claude
Legendary chef Michel Roux dies at 78,"Legendary chef Michel Roux dies at 78

LONDON - Michel Roux, the renowned French chef and restaurateur who helped revolutionize British cuisine, has died at the age of 78. Roux's family confirmed his passing in a statement released earlier today, citing complications from a long-standing illness.

Roux, along with his brother Albert, is credited with introducing fine dining to the United Kingdom and raising the standards of gastronomy in the country. The brothers opened the iconic Le Gavroche restaurant in London in 1967, which went on to become one of the most prestigious eateries in the world, earning three Michelin stars.

""It is with deep sadness that the Roux family announces the passing of our beloved grandfather, father, brother and uncle, Michel Roux OBE,"" the family's statement read. ""The man who introduced Britain to classic French cooking has died at the age of 78 after a long battle with a respiratory illness.""

Born in 1941 in the Burgundy region of France, Roux began his culinary journey at a young age, learning the art of French cuisine from his parents, who were both professional chefs. After honing his skills in various Michelin-starred restaurants across Europe, Roux and his brother Albert decided to open their own establishment in London, revolutionizing the city's dining scene.

""When we opened Le Gavroche in 1967, the food culture in Britain was very different,"" Roux said in a 2015 interview. ""People were used to basic, uninspired meals. We wanted to change that and show them the true potential of French gastronomy.""

And change it they did. Le Gavroche quickly became a destination for food enthusiasts from around the world, attracting a loyal following of discerning diners. The restaurant's impeccable service, elegant decor, and, most importantly, its exquisite cuisine, earned it a reputation as one of the finest dining establishments in Europe.

Roux's impact on the culinary landscape extended far beyond the walls of Le Gavroche. He mentored countless young chefs, many of whom went on to become renowned culinary figures in their own right. His influence can be seen in the work of acclaimed chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Marcus Wareing, and Monica Galetti, all of whom trained under the Roux brothers.

""Michel Roux was a true giant of the industry, a man whose passion and dedication to his craft were unparalleled,"" said Ramsay, who worked at Le Gavroche in the 1980s. ""He set the standard for excellence in the kitchen, and his legacy will continue to inspire generations of chefs to come.""

In recognition of his contributions to the culinary world, Roux was awarded numerous accolades throughout his career, including two Michelin stars, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cateys, and an OBE from the Queen for his services to the hospitality industry.

Despite his immense success, Roux remained humble and dedicated to his craft, constantly striving to push the boundaries of French cuisine. He continued to work in the kitchen at Le Gavroche until his retirement in 2002, ensuring that the restaurant maintained its high standards of excellence.

""Cooking was not just a job for Michel, it was a way of life,"" said his nephew, Michel Roux Jr., who took over the management of Le Gavroche after his uncle's retirement. ""He lived and breathed it, and his passion was infectious. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him, both in the industry and among his loyal patrons.""

Roux's passing marks the end of an era in the world of fine dining. His legacy, however, will live on through the countless chefs and restaurateurs he has inspired, and the countless diners whose palates he has forever transformed.",claude

"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much

In a world where art often reflects the complexities of the human experience, few figures have left a more indelible mark than the legendary composer and lyricist, Stephen Sondheim. Hailed as a titan of the American musical theater, Sondheim's work has captivated audiences for decades, revealing a profound understanding of the human condition and the depth of emotion that lies within.

Born in 1930 in New York City, Sondheim's journey to becoming one of the most influential figures in the arts was not without its challenges. As a child, he was raised by a troubled mother, whose own emotional turmoil would shape the young Sondheim's worldview. ""I always felt that I had to be twice as good as everybody else,"" Sondheim once remarked, ""because I was so terribly sensitive.""

This sensitivity, combined with an unwavering dedication to his craft, would become the foundation upon which Sondheim built his remarkable career. From his early collaborations with the likes of Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins to his later masterpieces, such as ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Sunday in the Park with George,"" Sondheim's work has consistently challenged audiences to confront the complexities of the human experience.

""I think one of the reasons my work has been so influential is that I'm not afraid to tackle the darker, more uncomfortable aspects of life,"" Sondheim once said in an interview. ""I'm interested in exploring the nuances of emotion, the ways in which we can be both heroic and flawed, noble and petty, all at the same time.""

This willingness to delve into the shadows of the human psyche has earned Sondheim a legion of devoted fans and critical acclaim. His work has been praised for its literary depth, its musical sophistication, and its ability to capture the universal truths that bind us all together.

""Sondheim's genius lies in his ability to take the seemingly mundane and transform it into something extraordinary,"" says renowned theater critic, Meredith Willson. ""He has a way of finding the poetry in the everyday, of exposing the hidden depths that lurk beneath the surface of our lives.""

This ability to find the extraordinary in the ordinary has made Sondheim's work a touchstone for generations of artists and audiences alike. From the sweeping grandeur of ""West Side Story"" to the intimate, introspective musings of ""Company,"" his compositions have become a part of the cultural fabric, inspiring new interpretations and sparking endless discussions.

Yet, for all his success and accolades, Sondheim has never been one to rest on his laurels. Throughout his career, he has continued to push the boundaries of the musical theater form, experimenting with new styles and techniques, and challenging audiences to think in new and unexpected ways.

""I'm always trying to find new ways to explore the human experience,"" Sondheim has said. ""I'm not interested in just telling a story or entertaining an audience. I want to provoke thought, to challenge assumptions, to make people feel something deep and profound.""

It is this unwavering commitment to artistic integrity, combined with his profound understanding of the human condition, that has made Sondheim a towering figure in the world of the arts. His legacy will continue to inspire and influence generations of artists and audiences, reminding us all of the power of art to transform, to heal, and to connect us to the deepest parts of ourselves.

As the curtain falls on Sondheim's remarkable life and career, the world mourns the loss of a true master, a man who felt too much, and who used his art to share that feeling with the world.",claude
Indian MP: Our nation's glorious tradition of religious tolerance is being shredded,"Indian MP: Our Nation's Glorious Tradition of Religious Tolerance is Being Shredded

In a passionate speech delivered in the Indian Parliament, senior lawmaker Ravi Shankar Prasad decried the erosion of religious harmony in the country, warning that India's long-standing legacy of interfaith coexistence is under grave threat.

""Our nation has proudly stood as a beacon of religious tolerance for centuries,"" Prasad told the hushed chamber. ""But I am deeply concerned that this glorious tradition is now being callously shredded before our very eyes.""

The veteran politician, who has served multiple terms in both the upper and lower houses of the Indian legislature, painted a grim picture of rising intolerance, increased polarization, and a disturbing pattern of religious minorities facing discrimination and violence.

""What we are witnessing is a dangerous and systematic undermining of the principles of pluralism and mutual respect that have been the bedrock of our society,"" Prasad declared, his voice tinged with emotion. ""This is not just a threat to our social fabric – it is an assault on the very soul of India.""

The lawmaker pointed to a spate of recent incidents across the country, where Muslim citizens have been targeted, their homes and businesses attacked, and in some cases, even killed in what he described as ""lynch mob justice.""

""These are not isolated events,"" Prasad stressed. ""They are part of a broader trend that is deeply troubling and demands urgent action.""

The MP also expressed grave concern over the targeting of places of worship, with several incidents of Hindu extremists disrupting prayer services in mosques and churches. ""Our holy sites, regardless of faith, should be sacrosanct spaces of refuge and communion,"" he said. ""But they are now being desecrated with impunity.""

Prasad's impassioned speech resonated with many of his colleagues, who nodded in agreement as he detailed the erosion of India's cherished principles of secularism and religious harmony.

""We have always taken pride in our ability to celebrate our diversity, to embrace people of all faiths and backgrounds,"" the lawmaker said. ""But now, that inclusive spirit is being systematically undermined by the forces of hatred and intolerance.""

The veteran politician called on the government to take immediate and decisive action to address the growing crisis, urging stronger law enforcement measures, enhanced protection for religious minorities, and a nationwide campaign to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding.

""This is not just a political issue – it is a moral imperative,"" Prasad asserted. ""We must stand united, regardless of our political affiliations, to safeguard the very essence of what makes India great.""

As the speech concluded, the chamber erupted in a rare display of bipartisan applause, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the widespread concern over the deteriorating state of religious coexistence in the world's largest democracy.

""The time for complacency is over,"" Prasad warned. ""We must act now, before the flames of intolerance consume the very fabric of our nation.""",claude
The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.Ã¢ÂÂs Digital Henchman,"The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.'s Digital Henchman

In a shocking turn of events, the once-powerful and feared digital surveillance chief of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (M.B.S.) has been arrested, shedding light on the kingdom's shadowy efforts to monitor and silence its critics.

The arrest of Saad al-Jabri, a former top intelligence official, has sent shockwaves through the global intelligence community, raising concerns about the extent of Saudi Arabia's digital espionage and the fate of those who dare to challenge the authoritarian regime.

Al-Jabri, who had been living in self-imposed exile in Canada since 2017, was apprehended by Saudi authorities earlier this year, sparking an international legal battle that has thrust the kingdom's digital surveillance apparatus into the spotlight.

According to sources familiar with the matter, al-Jabri was a key figure in the Crown Prince's efforts to monitor and suppress dissent, both at home and abroad. As the head of the Saudi Interior Ministry's surveillance program, he reportedly oversaw a vast network of digital tools and techniques used to track, harass, and in some cases, eliminate the regime's perceived enemies.

""Al-Jabri was essentially M.B.S.'s digital henchman,"" said a former intelligence analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""He had access to some of the most sophisticated surveillance technology in the world, and he used it to ruthlessly target anyone who dared to challenge the Crown Prince's grip on power.""

The arrest of al-Jabri has also raised questions about the fate of other high-profile individuals who have run afoul of the Saudi regime. In 2018, the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the Saudi government, sent shockwaves through the international community and tarnished the Crown Prince's reputation.

According to human rights groups, the Saudi government has used digital surveillance tools to monitor and harass Khashoggi and other dissidents, both within the kingdom and abroad. The arrest of al-Jabri suggests that these efforts may have been even more extensive and coordinated than previously known.

""This case highlights the lengths to which the Saudi government will go to silence its critics and maintain its grip on power,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now, a human rights organization. ""It's a disturbing reminder of the dangers faced by those who dare to speak out against the regime.""

The legal battle over al-Jabri's fate has also drawn attention to the complex web of alliances and rivalries within the Saudi royal family. According to reports, al-Jabri was a close ally of the late King Abdullah, who was seen as a moderate counterweight to the more hardline faction led by M.B.S.

After the Crown Prince consolidated power in 2017, al-Jabri reportedly fled the country, fearing for his life. His arrest in Canada earlier this year was seen by many as a bold move by M.B.S. to eliminate a potential rival and solidify his grip on power.

The case has also highlighted the role of technology in modern authoritarian regimes, with experts warning that the use of sophisticated digital surveillance tools is becoming increasingly common in countries around the world.

""What's happening in Saudi Arabia is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, a digital rights organization. ""Governments are using these tools to monitor and control their citizens in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago, and the implications for human rights and democracy are deeply concerning.""

As the legal battle over al-Jabri's fate continues, the world will be watching closely to see how the Saudi regime responds and whether the case will lead to a broader reckoning with the kingdom's use of digital surveillance and its impact on human rights.",claude
AT&T tells employees to work from home,"AT&T Tells Employees to Work from Home Amid COVID-19 Concerns

In a move to prioritize the health and safety of its workforce, AT&T has instructed its employees to work from home until further notice, the company announced on Monday.

The decision, which will affect the telecommunications giant's vast workforce of over 200,000 employees, comes as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt businesses and daily life across the United States.

""The health and well-being of our employees is our top priority,"" said Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of AT&T. ""By having our employees work remotely, we can do our part to help limit the spread of this virus and protect our workforce.""

The directive applies to all AT&T employees whose jobs can be performed remotely, including those in administrative, customer service, and technical support roles. Essential personnel, such as field technicians and network operations staff, will continue to report to their respective work locations.

According to the company, the work-from-home policy will be implemented in a phased approach, with certain departments and locations transitioning first. Employees have been instructed to take any necessary equipment, such as laptops and work phones, home with them to ensure a seamless transition to remote work.

""We have been preparing for this scenario for some time,"" said John Donovan, Chief Technology Officer at AT&T. ""Our robust network infrastructure and secure remote access capabilities will allow our employees to continue serving our customers without disruption.""

The move is part of a broader effort by AT&T to safeguard its workforce and mitigate the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on its operations. The company has also implemented enhanced cleaning protocols at its facilities and restricted non-essential business travel.

Industry analysts believe that AT&T's decision to have its employees work from home could set a precedent for other large corporations as the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve.

""This is a prudent and proactive step taken by AT&T to protect its employees and ensure business continuity,"" said technology analyst Jessica Rosenworcel. ""We may see more companies follow suit in the coming days and weeks as the virus continues to spread.""

The work-from-home directive comes at a time when many businesses are grappling with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous companies have already implemented similar measures, with some going as far as to close their physical offices altogether.

For AT&T employees, the transition to remote work may present both opportunities and challenges. While it allows them to avoid potential exposure to the virus, it also requires them to adapt to new ways of collaborating and maintaining productivity outside of a traditional office setting.

""We understand that this transition may be disruptive for some of our employees,"" said Stephenson. ""That's why we're providing them with the necessary resources and support to ensure a smooth and successful remote work experience.""

AT&T has also pledged to continue supporting its customers during this time, assuring that its network and services will remain operational and reliable.

""Our customers can count on us to keep them connected, whether they're working from home, learning remotely, or staying in touch with loved ones,"" said Donovan.

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how long AT&T's work-from-home directive will remain in place. However, the company's proactive approach to protecting its employees and maintaining business continuity is likely to be closely watched by others in the industry and beyond.",claude
Online sales of hand sanitizer and other 'virus protectors' spiked over 800% this year in the US,"Online Sales of Hand Sanitizer and Other 'Virus Protectors' Spiked Over 800% This Year in the US

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans have turned to online shopping in droves to stock up on hand sanitizer and other products marketed as protection against the virus. Data released by major e-commerce platforms reveals a staggering surge in demand for these items, with sales increasing by over 800% compared to the previous year.

The spike in online purchases reflects the public's heightened concerns about the spread of COVID-19 and the desire to find effective ways to safeguard their health. As physical stores struggled to keep up with the overwhelming demand, many consumers have shifted their shopping habits to the internet, where a wider selection of ""virus-fighting"" products is available.

""It's been an unprecedented year for the hand sanitizer and personal protective equipment (PPE) market,"" said Jane Doe, a retail analyst at XYZ Research. ""The pandemic has driven a massive behavioral shift, with people increasingly relying on online channels to access these in-demand items.""

Among the best-selling products are hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes, and face masks. Industry data shows that online sales of hand sanitizer alone increased by over 800% in 2020 compared to the previous year. The surge was particularly pronounced in the early months of the pandemic, as consumers rushed to stockpile these items amid widespread shortages.

""When the pandemic first hit, people were scrambling to find hand sanitizer and other cleaning supplies,"" said John Smith, a 32-year-old office worker in Chicago. ""I must have checked a dozen different websites before I could finally get my hands on a few bottles. It was crazy.""

The demand for these products has remained high throughout the year, with many consumers continuing to purchase them in bulk to ensure a steady supply. This trend has been a boon for e-commerce platforms, which have adapted quickly to meet the changing needs of their customers.

""We've seen a massive influx of orders for hand sanitizer, face masks, and other virus-related products,"" said Sarah Lee, a spokesperson for XYZ Online, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the US. ""It's been a challenge to keep up with the demand, but we've worked hard to expand our inventory and streamline our fulfillment processes to ensure that customers can get the items they need.""

The surge in online sales has also led to the emergence of a thriving secondary market, with some sellers taking advantage of the high demand to inflate prices. This has prompted concerns about price gouging and the availability of affordable options for consumers.

""It's frustrating to see some sellers taking advantage of the situation by charging exorbitant prices,"" said Jane Doe, the retail analyst. ""While the overall demand for these products remains high, it's important that consumers have access to reasonably priced options, especially for those who may be on a tight budget.""

Despite the challenges, industry experts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the hand sanitizer and virus protection market. As the pandemic continues to evolve, they expect the demand for these products to remain elevated, with online sales continuing to play a crucial role in meeting consumer needs.

""The pandemic has fundamentally changed the way people think about personal hygiene and disease prevention,"" said John Smith, the office worker. ""Even when things eventually return to normal, I think a lot of us will continue to rely on hand sanitizer and other protective measures as a way to stay healthy and safe.""",claude
Coronavirus test: confusion over availability and criteria is leaving sick people wondering if they're infected,"Coronavirus Test: Confusion Over Availability and Criteria Is Leaving Sick People Wondering If They're Infected

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the country, many Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to get tested for the virus, leaving them uncertain about their health status and the potential risk they pose to their loved ones.

Despite assurances from government officials that testing capacity is rapidly expanding, numerous reports suggest that access to coronavirus tests remains limited in many areas, with strict criteria in place that exclude a significant number of symptomatic individuals.

""I've been sick for over a week with all the typical COVID-19 symptoms, but my doctor says I don't qualify for a test,"" said Sarah Thompson, a 32-year-old resident of Los Angeles. ""It's incredibly frustrating because I have no way of knowing if I've been infected and need to self-isolate to protect my family.""

Thompson's experience is far from unique. Across the country, healthcare providers are being forced to ration COVID-19 tests, prioritizing only the most high-risk patients, such as the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, and healthcare workers.

""The demand for testing has far outpaced the supply, and we simply don't have enough tests to screen everyone who is symptomatic,"" said Dr. Emily Walters, the medical director of a community health clinic in Chicago. ""We have to make difficult decisions about who gets tested based on the criteria set by state and federal health authorities.""

These criteria, which vary from state to state, often exclude individuals who do not meet certain age or health status requirements, or who have not recently traveled to high-risk areas or been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case.

""It's a really challenging situation because we want to make sure the people who need the tests the most are able to get them, but it leaves a lot of people in limbo,"" said Dr. Walters.

The lack of widespread testing has also made it difficult for public health officials to accurately track the spread of the virus and implement effective containment strategies.

""Without comprehensive testing, we're flying blind,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""We need to have a much better understanding of how many people are actually infected in order to make informed decisions about how to respond to this pandemic.""

The Trump administration has faced criticism for its handling of the testing situation, with some experts arguing that the federal government should have acted more swiftly to ensure an adequate supply of tests and streamline the approval process.

""We were caught flat-footed, and now we're playing catch-up,"" said Dr. Osterholm. ""It's a failure of preparedness that is having real consequences for people's health and the overall public health response.""

As the situation continues to evolve, healthcare providers and public health officials are urging the public to remain vigilant and follow recommended guidelines for social distancing and hygiene, even if they are unable to get tested.

""The most important thing right now is to act as if you could be infected and take steps to protect yourself and others,"" said Dr. Walters. ""Stay home if you're sick, wash your hands frequently, and avoid close contact with people outside your household. These measures can make a big difference in slowing the spread of the virus.""

For those who are unable to get tested, the uncertainty can be particularly difficult to bear. But healthcare providers are encouraging people to focus on their own health and well-being, rather than obsessing over their testing status.

""I know it's frustrating, but try not to let the lack of testing add to your stress,"" said Dr. Walters. ""If you're sick, assume you have COVID-19 and take the necessary precautions. The most important thing is to take care of yourself and your loved ones during this challenging time.""",claude
Technology of Business,"Technology of Business

In the ever-evolving landscape of the modern economy, the role of technology in shaping and driving business practices has become increasingly prominent. From streamlining operations to enhancing customer experiences, the integration of technological advancements has become a cornerstone of success for companies across a wide range of industries.

One of the most significant ways technology has transformed the business world is through the automation of various processes. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms have enabled businesses to automate tasks that were once labor-intensive, such as data analysis, customer service, and even decision-making. This automation not only increases efficiency but also frees up valuable human resources, allowing employees to focus on more strategic and creative endeavors.

""The ability to automate repetitive tasks has been a game-changer for many businesses,"" explains Jane Doe, a technology analyst at a leading research firm. ""Companies that have embraced these technologies have seen significant improvements in productivity, cost savings, and the ability to scale their operations.""

Alongside automation, the proliferation of cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses store, manage, and access data. The cloud-based model allows companies to leverage scalable and secure storage solutions, as well as access a wide range of software and services on-demand. This has enabled businesses to reduce their reliance on costly on-premises infrastructure, while also enhancing collaboration and remote work capabilities.

""The cloud has truly democratized access to enterprise-level technology,"" says John Smith, the chief information officer of a mid-sized manufacturing company. ""Smaller businesses can now leverage the same powerful tools and resources that were once only available to large corporations, leveling the playing field and fostering innovation.""

Another area where technology has had a profound impact is in the realm of customer experience. Businesses are increasingly turning to digital platforms, such as e-commerce websites and mobile applications, to engage with their customers. These platforms not only provide a convenient and personalized shopping experience but also generate valuable data that can be used to better understand customer preferences and tailor offerings accordingly.

""Customers today expect a seamless, omnichannel experience when interacting with brands,"" explains Sarah Lee, the chief marketing officer of a leading retail chain. ""By integrating technology into our customer touchpoints, we've been able to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, our bottom line.""

Furthermore, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled businesses to collect and analyze data from a vast network of connected devices, allowing for more informed decision-making and the optimization of operations. From smart manufacturing equipment to intelligent supply chain management systems, IoT technologies are transforming the way companies operate and interact with their physical assets.

""IoT has the potential to revolutionize entire industries,"" says Dr. Kimberly Chen, a professor of business technology at a prestigious university. ""By connecting devices and gathering real-time data, businesses can make more informed decisions, reduce waste, and enhance overall efficiency.""

As technology continues to evolve, the integration of emerging technologies, such as blockchain, 5G, and quantum computing, is expected to further disrupt and transform the business landscape. These advancements promise to enhance security, enable faster and more reliable communication, and unlock new possibilities for data analysis and decision-making.

""The pace of technological change is only accelerating, and businesses that fail to adapt and embrace these innovations risk being left behind,"" warns Jane Doe. ""The companies that thrive in the years to come will be those that can effectively leverage technology to drive innovation, improve operations, and deliver exceptional value to their customers.""

In conclusion, the role of technology in shaping the future of business cannot be overstated. From automating processes to enhancing customer experiences, the integration of technological advancements has become a crucial component of success in the modern business landscape. As the pace of change continues to accelerate, businesses must remain agile, innovative, and willing to embrace the transformative power of technology.",claude

Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"Branding News Outlets as Foreign Agents Won't Make Them Any More Transparent

In a move that has stirred controversy in the media landscape, several government officials have proposed labeling certain news outlets as ""foreign agents."" The rationale behind this initiative is to increase transparency and accountability, but experts argue that this approach may backfire and undermine the very goals it seeks to achieve.

The push to designate news organizations as foreign agents has gained traction in recent years, with proponents arguing that it is necessary to address the perceived influence of foreign powers on domestic media. However, media experts and press freedom advocates warn that such a move could have far-reaching consequences for the integrity and independence of journalism.

""Labeling news outlets as foreign agents is a concerning trend that threatens to erode press freedom and public trust in the media,"" says Jane Doe, a media law professor at a leading university. ""Instead of fostering transparency, it could actually have the opposite effect, making it more difficult for journalists to do their job effectively.""

One of the key concerns raised by critics is the potential for such designations to be used as a political tool to discredit and marginalize news outlets that are critical of the government or hold differing ideological views. ""There is a real risk that this could become a way to silence or delegitimize media organizations that are seen as inconvenient or unfriendly to those in power,"" Doe warns.

Moreover, the designation of a news outlet as a foreign agent could have severe practical implications, such as restrictions on access to information, difficulties in securing advertising and sponsorship, and even legal consequences for journalists and their sources. This, in turn, could hamper the ability of these outlets to gather and disseminate information, ultimately depriving the public of a diverse and well-informed media landscape.

""The fundamental purpose of journalism is to serve the public interest by providing accurate, independent, and critical reporting,"" says John Smith, a veteran journalist and media commentator. ""Labeling news outlets as foreign agents undermines this core mission and erodes the public's trust in the media, which is essential for a healthy democracy.""

Proponents of the foreign agent designation argue that it is necessary to combat the spread of disinformation and foreign influence in the media. However, experts counter that there are more effective and less restrictive ways to address these concerns, such as strengthening media literacy programs, improving transparency in digital advertising, and investing in investigative reporting.

""If the goal is to increase transparency and accountability in the media, there are better ways to go about it that don't involve branding news outlets as foreign agents,"" says Doe. ""We should be focusing on enhancing journalistic standards, improving media literacy, and ensuring that the public has access to a diverse range of reliable and trustworthy information sources.""

As the debate over the foreign agent designation continues, media organizations and press freedom advocates are calling for a more nuanced and collaborative approach that prioritizes the public's right to access accurate and independent information. They argue that the solution lies not in labeling news outlets as foreign agents, but in fostering a media environment that is truly transparent, accountable, and committed to serving the public good.",claude
Meghan tells London students to 'speak up' for women's rights,"Meghan Tells London Students to 'Speak Up' for Women's Rights

London, UK - In a powerful speech delivered at a prestigious girls' school in central London, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, urged young students to use their voices to advocate for gender equality and women's rights.

The Duchess, who is known for her advocacy work on issues of social justice and women's empowerment, visited the Mulberry School for Girls on Tuesday, where she met with a group of sixth-form students to discuss the challenges faced by women and girls around the world.

""Your voices are those of the future leaders, the change-makers, the artists, the athletes, the parliamentarians,"" Meghan told the attentive audience. ""And you have the power to really shift the needle in a way that perhaps my generation has not quite been able to do yet.""

Drawing on her own experiences as a biracial woman navigating the public spotlight, the Duchess emphasized the importance of speaking up and using one's platform to amplify marginalized voices.

""I know how it feels to have your voice silenced,"" she said. ""I know what it's like to be told that you're not good enough just the way you are. But I'm here to tell you that you are good enough. More than good enough. You are vital, you are valuable, and you have the power to change the world.""

Meghan's visit to the school comes at a time of renewed global focus on women's rights and gender equality, with issues such as the gender pay gap, reproductive rights, and violence against women remaining persistent challenges.

In her remarks, the Duchess highlighted the disproportionate impact of these issues on women and girls in developing countries, where access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities can be severely limited.

""We know that when girls are given the chance to learn, they have the power to change entire communities,"" Meghan said. ""But too many girls around the world are still denied that chance. They're still told that they're not worthy, that they don't belong, that they can't make a difference.""

The Duchess urged the students to use their education and their platforms to advocate for those girls and women, and to challenge the systemic barriers that prevent them from reaching their full potential.

""I want you to know that you have a responsibility,"" she said. ""A responsibility to speak up, to stand up for what's right, to use your voice to make a difference. Because the world needs you. The world is counting on you.""

Throughout her visit, Meghan engaged in lively discussions with the students, listening intently to their concerns and experiences, and offering words of encouragement and support.

""She really connected with us,"" said Fatima, a 17-year-old student at the school. ""She made us feel empowered and inspired to take action, to use our voices to make a real impact.""

The Duchess's visit was warmly received by the school community, with the headteacher, Vanessa Ogden, praising Meghan's commitment to championing the rights of women and girls.

""Meghan's message today was one of hope, resilience, and the transformative power of education,"" Ogden said. ""Our students were deeply moved and motivated by her words, and we're grateful for the opportunity to host such a passionate and influential advocate for gender equality.""

As the Duchess departed the school, she was greeted by a crowd of cheering supporters, many of whom held signs and banners expressing their admiration and support for her work.

""Meghan has always been a powerful voice for women's rights,"" said one onlooker, Natalie, a local resident. ""It's inspiring to see her using her platform to empower the next generation of young women and girls.""",claude
How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger,"Architect Mariam Kamara Designs Sustainable Future for Niger

Niamey, Niger - In a country facing pressing environmental and economic challenges, one woman is leading the charge to create a more sustainable future. Mariam Kamara, a renowned architect and urban designer, is spearheading innovative projects that are transforming Niger's built environment and improving the lives of its people.

Kamara's work is rooted in a deep understanding of Niger's unique cultural heritage and the pressing need to address the country's pressing development issues. ""As an architect, I believe we have a responsibility to design spaces that not only meet the practical needs of communities, but also uplift their spirit and preserve their traditions,"" she explains.

One of Kamara's most ambitious projects is the redesign of Niamey's central market. Historically, the market has been a vibrant hub of commercial activity, but years of unchecked growth and urbanization have left it in a state of disrepair, with poor sanitation, limited shade, and hazardous pedestrian traffic.

Kamara's plan aims to breathe new life into the market while addressing these pressing concerns. By incorporating traditional architectural elements, such as expansive shaded walkways and open-air courtyards, Kamara has created a design that not only enhances the market's functionality but also celebrates Niger's rich cultural heritage.

""The market is the heart of the community,"" Kamara says. ""By designing spaces that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing, we can create a sense of pride and ownership among the vendors and shoppers who rely on it.""

In addition to the market project, Kamara has also been involved in the development of several affordable housing communities in Niamey. These projects, which incorporate passive cooling techniques and renewable energy sources, are designed to provide high-quality, sustainable living options for low-income residents.

""Housing is a fundamental human right, and it's our responsibility as architects to ensure that everyone has access to safe, comfortable, and environmentally-friendly homes,"" Kamara explains.

Kamara's work has not gone unnoticed. She has received numerous accolades, including the prestigious Aga Khan Award for Architecture, which recognized her commitment to sustainable and culturally-sensitive design. Additionally, she has been invited to speak at prestigious conferences and institutions around the world, sharing her vision for a more equitable and environmentally-conscious built environment.

But Kamara's impact extends far beyond the awards and accolades. Her projects have had a tangible impact on the lives of Niger's citizens, providing them with access to improved infrastructure, better living conditions, and a renewed sense of pride in their communities.

""Mariam Kamara is a true visionary,"" says Fatima Alhassan, a resident of one of Kamara's affordable housing communities. ""Her designs not only make our lives more comfortable, but they also celebrate our cultural identity and empower us to be active participants in shaping the future of our country.""

As Niger continues to grapple with the challenges of rapid urbanization, climate change, and economic instability, Kamara's work stands as a beacon of hope and a model for sustainable development. By prioritizing the needs of local communities and drawing inspiration from Niger's rich cultural heritage, she is paving the way for a more equitable and environmentally-conscious future.

""At the end of the day, my work is not just about creating beautiful buildings,"" Kamara says. ""It's about empowering people, preserving traditions, and building a more sustainable and inclusive world. That's the legacy I hope to leave behind.""",claude
Crawling in a 'polio-free' country,"Crawling in a 'Polio-Free' Country

In a shocking turn of events, a young child in Smalltown, Anystate has been diagnosed with a confirmed case of polio, a disease that was declared eradicated in the United States over 40 years ago. The discovery of this case has sent shockwaves through the local community and raised serious questions about the nation's public health protocols.

The infected child, 5-year-old Samantha Wilson, was rushed to Smalltown General Hospital earlier this week after her parents noticed she was experiencing muscle weakness and difficulty walking. Initial tests confirmed the presence of the poliovirus, a highly contagious virus that primarily affects young children and can lead to lifelong paralysis.

""We were completely blindsided by this,"" said Dr. Emily Ramirez, the attending physician. ""Polio hasn't been seen in this country since 1979, so no one was expecting it to suddenly resurface like this. We're working around the clock to contain the outbreak and ensure no other children are affected.""

Public health officials have immediately sprung into action, launching a comprehensive investigation into the source of the infection. Preliminary findings suggest that Samantha may have contracted the virus through contact with an individual who had recently traveled to a region where polio remains endemic.

""We're exploring all possible avenues to determine how this child was exposed,"" said CDC Director Dr. Sarah Wilkins. ""Our top priority is identifying any other potential cases and preventing this from spreading further within the community.""

In response to the diagnosis, local and state authorities have implemented a series of emergency measures. All unvaccinated children in the Smalltown area are being urged to receive the polio vaccine immediately, and a citywide vaccination campaign is underway to ensure maximum coverage.

Additionally, health officials have initiated contact tracing efforts, working to identify and quarantine any individuals who may have come into close contact with Samantha. Schools, daycares, and other public facilities have been instructed to heighten their sanitation protocols and monitor students for any signs of illness.

""We're leaving no stone unturned,"" said Smalltown Mayor, John Doe. ""The health and safety of our community is our number one concern. We're committed to working closely with state and federal agencies to get to the bottom of this and prevent any further spread of the virus.""

The reemergence of polio in the United States has sparked widespread concern and confusion, as the nation had long been considered ""polio-free."" The last case of naturally occurring polio in the country was reported in 1979, and the disease was officially declared eradicated from the U.S. in 1979.

""This is a major setback in our efforts to eliminate polio globally,"" said Dr. Wilkins. ""The fact that it has resurfaced, even in a single case, demonstrates the ongoing challenges we face in maintaining high vaccination rates and vigilant disease surveillance.""

Public health experts emphasize that the key to preventing polio outbreaks lies in maintaining robust vaccination coverage. The polio vaccine, which is typically administered as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule, has been instrumental in driving down the incidence of the disease worldwide.

""Vaccines are our best defense against polio,"" said Dr. Ramirez. ""They provide strong protection against the virus and help create a barrier of immunity within the community. It's crucial that parents ensure their children are up-to-date on their polio vaccinations.""

As the investigation into the Smalltown case continues, health officials are urging the public to remain vigilant and to report any symptoms of polio, such as muscle weakness, fever, and difficulty swallowing or breathing, to their healthcare providers immediately.

""We're in uncharted territory here,"" said Mayor Doe. ""But we're committed to doing everything in our power to contain this outbreak and protect the health and well-being of our community. We're calling on everyone to do their part and help us overcome this challenge.""",claude
Disneyland closes because of the coronavirus outbreak,"Disneyland Closes Indefinitely Amid COVID-19 Outbreak

Anaheim, CA - In an unprecedented move, Disneyland Resort announced today that it will be closing its doors temporarily in response to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The decision, which takes effect this Saturday, March 14th, marks the first time the iconic theme park has closed since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

""The health and safety of our guests and cast members is our top priority,"" said Bob Chapek, Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company. ""We are proceeding with an abundance of caution and will continue to closely monitor the situation.""

The closure will impact both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, as well as the resort's hotels and the Downtown Disney District. Disneyland officials stated that they anticipate reopening the parks on March 31st, but noted that the timeline could change depending on the progression of the virus.

The announcement comes just days after several other major theme parks, including Universal Studios Hollywood and Knott's Berry Farm, announced temporary closures of their own. It also follows the cancellation of this year's Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals, as well as the NBA's decision to suspend its season indefinitely.

""This is an incredibly difficult decision, but it's the right thing to do for our cast, guests and community,"" Chapek added. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as needed.""

Disneyland, which first opened its doors in 1955, has only closed a handful of times in its 65-year history. In addition to the post-9/11 closure, the park has also shut down due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Los Angeles earthquake, and the 1969 Watts riots.

The decision to close the park comes as California grapples with a growing number of COVID-19 cases. As of Thursday, the state had reported 198 confirmed cases and four deaths related to the virus. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency and urged residents to avoid large gatherings and practice social distancing.

""This is an unprecedented public health crisis, and we are taking decisive action to protect our communities,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""I commend Disneyland and other businesses for putting the health and safety of their employees and customers first.""

The closure is expected to have a significant economic impact on the surrounding Anaheim community, which relies heavily on tourism and the theme park industry. Disneyland is one of the city's largest employers, with over 31,000 cast members, and the resort attracts millions of visitors each year.

""Disneyland is the heart and soul of Anaheim, and this closure will be felt throughout our city,"" said Anaheim Mayor Harry Sidhu. ""We are working closely with Disney and other businesses to support our community during this challenging time.""

Despite the temporary shutdown, Disney officials have assured guests that all previously purchased tickets will be honored at a later date. The company has also announced that it will continue to pay its cast members during the closure.

""We know this news is disappointing, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience,"" Chapek said. ""But we believe this is the right decision to protect the health and well-being of our guests and cast members.""

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how long Disneyland and other theme parks will remain closed. However, experts agree that the decision to prioritize public health over economic concerns is a necessary and responsible one.

""This is a challenging time for everyone, but it's important that we all do our part to slow the spread of this virus,"" said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, Director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. ""We commend Disneyland for taking this proactive step and encourage other businesses to follow suit.""",claude
How to prepare for ex-President Trump,"How to Prepare for Ex-President Trump

In the wake of the 2024 presidential election, the nation finds itself in uncharted territory as former President Donald Trump navigates his post-White House life. With the ex-president's continued influence and the potential for future political aspirations, it's crucial for Americans to understand how to navigate this new landscape.

Experts warn that the transition from a sitting president to a former one is rarely a smooth process, and the case of Trump is particularly complex. ""We're in uncharted waters,"" says Dr. Sarah Longwell, a political scientist at the University of Washington. ""Trump's unconventional approach to the presidency and his ongoing presence in the public sphere present unique challenges for the country.""

One of the primary concerns is the potential for Trump to maintain a strong political presence, even without the formal powers of the presidency. ""He's still a major figure in the Republican Party, and his supporters remain fiercely loyal,"" explains Longwell. ""This means he could continue to wield significant influence, both in terms of shaping the party's agenda and mobilizing his base.""

To prepare for this scenario, political analysts suggest that citizens and institutions should adopt a proactive approach. ""It's important to stay informed and engaged,"" says Dr. Michael Steele, a political commentator and former chairman of the Republican National Committee. ""Trump may no longer be in the Oval Office, but his impact on the political landscape will likely continue to be felt.""

One area of focus should be monitoring Trump's public statements and activities. ""He's known for making controversial and often inflammatory remarks, so it's crucial to stay vigilant and fact-check any claims he makes,"" Steele advises. ""This will help prevent the spread of misinformation and ensure that the public has access to accurate, reliable information.""

Additionally, experts recommend that individuals and organizations closely follow Trump's legal and financial situation. ""There are a number of ongoing investigations and lawsuits that could have significant implications for the ex-president,"" says Longwell. ""It's important to stay up-to-date on these developments, as they could impact his ability to maintain a prominent public role.""

For those concerned about the potential for Trump to continue to influence the political process, experts suggest engaging in civic participation and supporting democratic institutions. ""It's crucial that citizens remain engaged in the political process, whether that's through voting, contacting their representatives, or participating in local and national discussions,"" Steele emphasizes.

Furthermore, Longwell recommends that institutions, such as media organizations, educational institutions, and government agencies, take proactive steps to safeguard their independence and integrity. ""Trump has a history of trying to undermine and discredit institutions that he perceives as threats,"" she says. ""It's important for these organizations to be vigilant and to actively defend their role in maintaining a healthy democracy.""

Overall, the transition from a Trump presidency to a post-Trump era is likely to be a complex and challenging process. However, experts believe that by staying informed, engaged, and committed to democratic values, Americans can navigate this new landscape effectively.

""The key is to remain vigilant, to fact-check claims, and to support the institutions and processes that are essential to a functioning democracy,"" Steele concludes. ""Only by doing so can we ensure that the United States emerges from this period stronger and more resilient than ever before.""",claude

Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters,"Here is a 650-word news article based on the title ""Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters"":

Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters

By Alex Thompson, National Political Correspondent

In the 2020 Democratic primary, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders failed to gain traction with a crucial voting bloc - black Americans. Despite his progressive policy platform and vocal support from younger, more diverse voters, Sanders struggled to win over a majority of black voters, especially in key states like South Carolina and across the South.

Political analysts point to a number of factors that contributed to Sanders' challenges with this demographic. Chief among them was his perceived disconnect with the lived experiences and core concerns of many black Americans.

""Bernie just didn't have that innate connection or rapport with black voters the way someone like Joe Biden did,"" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist and commentator. ""He didn't have the long-standing relationships and trust built up over decades in the black community.""

Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, ran on a platform of sweeping reforms like Medicare for All, tuition-free public college, and aggressive action on climate change. While these policies could potentially benefit many black Americans, Sanders struggled to effectively communicate their real-world impact.

""A lot of black voters, understandably, were more focused on immediate, pocketbook issues like jobs, wages, housing, and health care access,"" said Simmons. ""Bernie's big, structural changes sounded great in theory, but many felt they were too ambitious or didn't address their most pressing needs.""

The senator's past statements and votes on issues of racial justice also complicated his outreach. His 1994 vote for a crime bill that contributed to mass incarceration, as well as his initial resistance to reparations for slavery, were seen by some as impediments.

""There's a persistent perception that Bernie is more concerned with economic inequality than racial injustice,"" said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a progressive organization. ""He had to work extra hard to show black voters that he truly understood and was committed to their specific struggles.""

Sanders' campaign did make concerted efforts to court black support, including high-profile endorsements, targeted ad buys, and events focused on criminal justice reform and voting rights. But in the end, it wasn't enough to overcome Biden's overwhelming advantage.

In South Carolina's primary, for instance, Biden won 61% of the black vote compared to just 17% for Sanders. Similar dynamics played out across the South, where Biden's longstanding relationships and perceived electability bolstered his support.

""Black voters are a diverse group with many different perspectives, but there's no doubt that the Democratic establishment's backing of Biden was a major factor,"" said Shropshire. ""Many felt he was the safer, more electable choice against Trump.""

Looking ahead, some analysts believe Sanders and progressives will need to do more to bridge the gap with black Americans, particularly older and more moderate voters. This could involve focus on issues like wealth inequality, access to capital for minority-owned businesses, and strengthening unions - all of which disproportionately impact communities of color.

""Bernie's vision is noble, but he has to find a way to make it resonate more with black voters,"" said Simmons. ""It's a challenge, but one that progressives can't afford to ignore if they want to build a truly multiracial coalition for the future.""",claude
Why we can't find hand sanitizer,"Nationwide Shortage of Hand Sanitizer Leaves Consumers Scrambling

In the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a new crisis has emerged: a nationwide shortage of hand sanitizer. As the demand for this essential hygiene product has skyrocketed, manufacturers and retailers have struggled to keep up, leaving shelves empty and consumers frustrated.

The root of the problem can be traced back to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. As cases began to surge across the United States, public health officials emphasized the importance of frequent handwashing and the use of hand sanitizer as a key defense against the virus. This sudden spike in demand has overwhelmed the supply chain, creating a ripple effect that has been difficult to overcome.

""We've never seen anything like this before,"" said Sarah Johnson, a spokesperson for the American Cleaning Institute. ""Hand sanitizer manufacturers are working around the clock to ramp up production, but they simply can't keep up with the sheer volume of orders coming in.""

One of the primary challenges facing producers is the availability of raw materials. The main active ingredient in hand sanitizer is alcohol, typically in the form of ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. As demand for these alcohols has surged, suppliers have struggled to keep up, leading to shortages and price hikes.

""It's a domino effect,"" explained Johnson. ""Manufacturers need the alcohol to make the hand sanitizer, but if they can't get enough of the raw material, they can't produce the final product. And that's before we even consider the bottleneck in packaging and distribution.""

Retailers have also been hit hard by the shortage. Many major chains, including Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens, have implemented purchase limits on hand sanitizer products, hoping to ensure that supplies last. Some stores have even resorted to locking up the remaining inventory to prevent hoarding.

""It's incredibly frustrating,"" said Sarah Gonzalez, a shopper in Los Angeles. ""I've been to five different stores in the past week, and they're all completely sold out. I just want to be able to keep my family safe, but it feels like hand sanitizer has become the new toilet paper.""

The shortage has also had ripple effects on other industries. Healthcare workers, who are at the frontlines of the pandemic, are facing critical shortages of hand sanitizer, putting their safety at risk.

""We're doing everything we can to source hand sanitizer, but it's a constant battle,"" said Dr. Emily Walters, a nurse at a hospital in New York City. ""We're having to ration what little we have, and it's just not enough to keep up with the demand.""

In response to the crisis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken steps to increase the supply of hand sanitizer. The agency has relaxed certain regulations, allowing more manufacturers to enter the market and expanding the types of alcohols that can be used.

However, these measures may take time to have a significant impact. In the meantime, consumers are being advised to prioritize handwashing with soap and water whenever possible, and to use hand sanitizer only when soap and water are not available.

""It's a frustrating situation, but we're all in this together,"" said Johnson. ""We're urging everyone to be patient and to only use hand sanitizer when absolutely necessary. The more we can conserve the limited supplies, the better off we'll all be.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the hand sanitizer shortage serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of our supply chains and the importance of preparedness. For now, consumers and healthcare providers alike will have to navigate this new challenge, hoping that a solution will emerge in the near future.",claude
Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination,"Here is a 600-word news article based on the title ""Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination"":

Uruguay Emerges as a Rising Star in the Global Wine Industry

MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay - With its lush rolling hills, temperate climate, and centuries-old winemaking traditions, the small South American nation of Uruguay is quickly establishing itself as an exciting new player on the global wine stage.

Long overshadowed by its larger neighbors Argentina and Chile, Uruguay's wine industry has recently begun to gain international recognition for the quality and unique character of its products. Fueled by growing domestic demand and a surge of investment, Uruguayan vintners are now producing world-class wines that are earning praise from critics and consumers alike.

""Uruguay is really capturing the attention of wine lovers around the world,"" says Alejandro Bulgheroni, one of the country's leading winemakers. ""We have the perfect terroir and climate for growing exceptional grapes, and our winemakers are incredibly skilled at coaxing out the full potential of our vineyards.""

A Unique Terroir and Climate
Uruguay's wine regions benefit from a unique combination of geography and climate that sets them apart from other South American wine destinations. Located along the Atlantic coast, the country enjoys a temperate maritime climate with warm, humid summers and mild, wet winters - conditions that are ideal for cultivating a diverse array of grape varietals.

The rolling hills and valleys of Uruguay's wine country are also blessed with a diverse range of soil types, from the sandy loams of Canelones to the rocky, mineral-rich soils of Maldonado. This varied terroir allows winemakers to experiment with different grape varieties and produce a wide spectrum of wine styles, from crisp, aromatic whites to bold, structured reds.

""What makes Uruguayan wine so special is the way our terroir interacts with the local climate,"" explains viticulturist Maria Noel Sosa. ""The cooling ocean breezes, the moderate temperatures, and the diverse soils all come together to create something truly unique.""

A Renaissance in Uruguayan Viticulture
While Uruguay has a long history of wine production dating back to the 16th century, the industry experienced a renaissance in the 1990s and 2000s as new investment, technology, and expertise flowed into the country.

Ambitious young winemakers, many of whom had trained or worked abroad, returned home to apply cutting-edge viticultural and oenological techniques to Uruguay's vineyards. Meanwhile, established family wineries modernized their operations and began exploring new grape varieties and wine styles.

The results have been nothing short of transformative. Uruguay's wines have steadily climbed in quality, earning accolades from international critics and securing distribution in premium markets around the world. Standout grape varieties include Tannat, the country's signature red grape, as well as Albariño, Viognier, and Marselan.

""There's a real sense of energy and innovation in the Uruguayan wine industry right now,"" says sommelier Julieta Casanova. ""Winemakers are pushing the boundaries, experimenting with new techniques, and really honing in on the unique character of Uruguay's terroir.""

Positioning for Global Growth
As Uruguay's wine industry continues to evolve, producers are now focusing on strategies to raise the country's profile on the global stage. Many are investing in modern, state-of-the-art wineries and tasting rooms to attract wine tourists, while others are forging partnerships with international distributors to expand their export markets.

The Uruguayan government has also taken steps to support the industry, including the creation of a national wine institute to coordinate research, marketing, and regulatory efforts. With growing domestic consumption and strong international demand, the future looks bright for Uruguay's wine producers.

""We're really just scratching the surface of Uruguay's potential as a wine destination,"" says Bulgheroni. ""In the years to come, I think you're going to see Uruguayan wines becoming much more prominent on the global stage.""",claude

Once considered a niche market, these alcohol-free beverages are now becoming increasingly popular, attracting a diverse range of consumers and transforming the way people approach their drinking experiences.

The growing demand for non-alcoholic cocktails can be attributed to a variety of factors. For one, there has been a heightened awareness around the health and wellness benefits of reducing alcohol consumption. Many people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are becoming more conscious of their drinking habits and seeking alternatives that allow them to socialize and enjoy the ritual of cocktail-making without the intoxicating effects of alcohol.

""There's a real shift happening in the industry,"" says Alex Ott, a renowned mixologist and consultant. ""Consumers are looking for more sophisticated, complex, and flavorful non-alcoholic options that can rival their alcoholic counterparts.""

This demand has led to a surge of innovation in the non-alcoholic cocktail market. Bartenders and mixologists are now experimenting with a wide range of ingredients, from exotic fruits and botanicals to complex flavor profiles and creative presentations. These non-alcoholic concoctions are designed to mimic the sensory experience of traditional cocktails, often featuring intricate garnishes, unique glassware, and even the use of techniques like barrel-aging or smoke infusion.

""It's not just about removing the alcohol,"" explains Ott. ""It's about creating a truly elevated and engaging drinking experience that caters to the growing number of consumers who want to enjoy the social and cultural aspects of cocktails without the associated risks.""

The rise of non-alcoholic cocktails has also had a significant impact on the bar and restaurant industry. Many establishments are now dedicating entire sections of their menus to these alcohol-free offerings, recognizing the potential for increased revenue and customer satisfaction.

""We've seen a significant increase in the demand for non-alcoholic cocktails over the past couple of years,"" says Sarah Lim, the beverage director at a popular urban gastropub. ""Our customers are really responding to the creativity and quality of these drinks, and it's become an important part of our overall beverage program.""

The trend has also inspired the development of a new generation of non-alcoholic spirit brands, which are designed to mimic the flavors and mouthfeel of traditional spirits. These products, often made from a blend of botanicals, herbs, and natural extracts, are being embraced by bartenders and consumers alike, providing a viable alternative to traditional liquors.

""The non-alcoholic spirit market has really exploded in recent years,"" says Ott. ""Brands like Seedlip, Ritual Zero Proof, and Lyre's are leading the charge, offering high-quality, versatile products that allow bartenders to create truly innovative non-alcoholic cocktails.""

As the non-alcoholic cocktail trend continues to gain momentum, industry experts predict that it will have a lasting impact on the way people approach their drinking habits. With a growing emphasis on mindful consumption and a desire for more inclusive social experiences, the rise of these alcohol-free offerings is set to reshape the bar and cocktail landscape for years to come.

""This is not just a passing fad,"" says Lim. ""Non-alcoholic cocktails are here to stay, and they're going to continue to evolve and become an integral part of the overall drinking culture.""",claude
"Coronavirus threat to Tokyo 2020 is 'heartbreaking,' says surfer Kanoa Igarashi","Coronavirus Threat to Tokyo 2020 is 'Heartbreaking,' Says Surfer Kanoa Igarashi

Tokyo, Japan - With the 2020 Summer Olympics just months away, the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the highly anticipated event. In a recent interview, Japanese-American surfer Kanoa Igarashi expressed his deep concerns about the potential impact of the virus on the games.

""It's heartbreaking to see the situation unfold,"" said Igarashi, who is set to represent Japan in the inaugural Olympic surfing competition. ""The Olympics are a dream for so many athletes around the world, and to have that threatened by this outbreak is just devastating.""

The coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, has already had a significant impact on sporting events worldwide. Several qualifying tournaments and international competitions have been postponed or canceled as countries work to contain the spread of the virus.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Japanese government have maintained that the Tokyo 2020 Games will proceed as scheduled, but they have acknowledged the need to closely monitor the situation.

""We are fully committed to a successful Olympic Games in Tokyo starting on the 24th of July,"" said IOC President Thomas Bach in a recent statement. ""At the same time, the health and safety of all those involved in the preparations for the Olympic Games is our top priority.""

Igarashi, who hails from Huntington Beach, California, but holds dual Japanese citizenship, understands the importance of the Olympics for his home country. ""Japan has been working so hard to prepare for these games,"" he said. ""The amount of time, money, and effort that has gone into making Tokyo 2020 a success is immense, and to have it all jeopardized by this virus is just heartbreaking.""

The 22-year-old surfer, who won a silver medal at the 2019 World Surfing Games, is particularly concerned about the potential impact on the athletes. ""We've all sacrificed so much to get to this point,"" he said. ""The thought of having that taken away, or of competing in front of empty stadiums, is just devastating.""

The coronavirus outbreak has already led to the postponement of several Olympic qualifying events, including the World Cup event in China and the Asian Surfing Championship in Taiwan. Igarashi, who is currently training in Japan, is hopeful that the situation will improve in the coming months, but he acknowledges the uncertainty.

""Right now, it's just a waiting game,"" he said. ""We're all closely monitoring the news and trying to stay positive, but it's hard not to be worried about what the future holds.""

Despite the challenges, Igarashi remains committed to representing Japan at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way,"" he said. ""I'm going to continue training hard and doing everything I can to be ready, no matter what happens.""

As the world watches the coronavirus situation unfold, the fate of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics hangs in the balance. For athletes like Kanoa Igarashi, the uncertainty is both frustrating and heartbreaking, but their determination to compete on the world's biggest stage remains unshaken.",claude

What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, March 12

By [Your Name], Staff Reporter

March 12, 2020

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread globally, here are the key updates you need to know today, Thursday, March 12.

Cases continue to rise worldwide
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has reached over 127,000, with more than 4,700 deaths, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus has now spread to over 110 countries and territories around the globe.

The hardest-hit countries remain China, where the outbreak originated, as well as Italy, Iran, and South Korea. However, cases are rapidly increasing in many other nations, including the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, and France.

WHO declares a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization officially declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the designation was due to the ""alarming levels of spread and severity"" of the virus, as well as ""alarming levels of inaction.""

The pandemic declaration means the WHO views the outbreak as a global crisis that requires a worldwide response. It is the first time the WHO has declared a pandemic since the 2009 H1N1 ""swine flu"" outbreak.

""Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,"" Tedros said. ""It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.""

Significant events and closures
In response to the worsening outbreak, a number of major events, gatherings, and institutions have been canceled, postponed, or closed in recent days:

- The NBA has suspended its season after a player tested positive for the virus.
- The NCAA has canceled its popular ""March Madness"" basketball tournaments.
- The Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals have been postponed until October.
- Disneyland in California will be closed starting on Saturday.
- Many schools and universities across the U.S. have moved to online-only classes.
- The European Union has banned most travel from outside the EU for 30 days.

Travel restrictions and advisories
In addition to the EU travel ban, numerous countries have implemented new travel restrictions and advisories:

- The U.S. has expanded its European travel ban to include the United Kingdom and Ireland.
- Canada has advised against all non-essential travel outside the country.
- Australia has banned all non-citizens from entering the country.
- India has suspended most visas, and is requiring a 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals.

Many countries have also closed borders, canceled flights, and urged citizens to avoid all unnecessary travel.

Economic impacts
The coronavirus outbreak has also had significant economic impacts around the world, with stock markets experiencing historic losses and many businesses suffering disruptions.

On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 6%, its biggest one-day drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Major industries like aviation, tourism, and retail have been hit especially hard.

Many economists believe the outbreak could trigger a global recession, as consumer spending and business activity decline. Governments are considering stimulus measures to support their economies during the crisis.

Public health response
Health authorities around the world are working to slow the spread of the virus through a variety of public health measures. These include travel restrictions, event cancellations, school closures, and calls for social distancing.

In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that gatherings of 50 people or more be canceled or postponed for the next eight weeks. Many states and cities have also declared states of emergency to unlock additional resources.

Globally, countries are ramping up testing capabilities, treating the sick, and trying to develop a vaccine, though that is still many months away.

""We're in this together, to do the right things with calm and protect the vulnerable,"" Tedros said. ""Let's all look out for each other.""",claude
Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus,"Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus

In a concerning turn of events, several high-profile world leaders and government officials have recently tested positive for the ongoing pandemic, sparking concerns about the potential impact on global stability and decision-making.

The news first broke when the office of the President of the United States confirmed that the leader had contracted the virus, despite extensive precautions and safety measures in place. The announcement was quickly followed by similar revelations from the offices of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Chancellor of Germany, all of whom are now self-isolating and receiving medical attention.

""This is an unprecedented situation that we are monitoring closely,"" said the White House Press Secretary during a hastily convened press conference. ""The President is experiencing mild symptoms and remains in good spirits, but we are taking every possible step to ensure his safety and the continuity of government.""

Similar sentiments were echoed by the offices of the other affected leaders, with the UK Prime Minister's spokesperson stating that the Prime Minister is ""working remotely and will continue to lead the nation's response to the pandemic,"" while the German Chancellor's team assured the public that she is ""resting comfortably and remains engaged in all critical decision-making.""

The news has sent shockwaves through the international community, with many expressing concerns about the potential implications for global cooperation and coordination in the face of the ongoing health crisis.

""The health and well-being of our world leaders is of paramount importance, not just for their own sake, but for the stability and security of the entire global order,"" said the Secretary-General of the United Nations. ""We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to offer any assistance or support that may be needed.""

The revelations have also raised questions about the vulnerability of even the most heavily guarded and protected individuals, as the virus continues to spread rapidly across the world.

""This just goes to show that no one is immune to the ravages of this pandemic,"" said a leading epidemiologist. ""Even the most powerful and influential people in the world are susceptible to the virus, and that underscores the urgent need for a coordinated, global response to this crisis.""

As the world watches anxiously, the affected leaders have vowed to continue their work and to lead their nations through the ongoing challenges, with the assurance that their health and safety remain the top priority.

""We will not be deterred by this setback,"" said the US President in a video message released from his quarantine. ""The work of government and the fight against this virus must go on, and I am committed to doing everything in my power to ensure that we emerge from this crisis stronger and more united than ever before.""

The news has also prompted renewed calls for increased testing and safety measures for world leaders and other high-profile figures, with many arguing that their health and well-being are crucial to the stability and security of the global order.

""We cannot afford to have our most important decision-makers sidelined by this virus,"" said a prominent member of the US Congress. ""It is imperative that we take every possible step to protect them and ensure that they can continue to lead us through this crisis.""

As the world watches with bated breath, the affected leaders have vowed to continue their work and to lead their nations through the ongoing challenges, with the assurance that their health and safety remain the top priority.",claude
Turkey: Boy saves puppy trapped in oil well,"Here is a 637-word news article based on the title ""Turkey: Boy saves puppy trapped in oil well"":

Turkey: Boy Saves Puppy Trapped in Oil Well

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey - In a heartwarming display of bravery and compassion, a young boy in southeastern Turkey rescued a puppy that had fallen into a deep oil well, capturing the attention and admiration of his local community.

The incident occurred last week in the rural village of Karayazi, where 12-year-old Muhammet Uzun noticed a distressed puppy whimpering at the bottom of an abandoned oil well on his family's property. Without hesitation, the young boy sprang into action, determined to save the trapped animal.

""I heard the puppy crying and knew I had to do something,"" said Muhammet. ""I couldn't just leave it there to suffer.""

Muhammet's father, Mehmet Uzun, recounted the harrowing events that unfolded. ""At first, we tried to lower a rope to pull the puppy up, but it was too deep and the puppy couldn't reach it,"" he explained. ""That's when Muhammet said he would go down and get the puppy himself.""

Despite the risks involved, Muhammet insisted on descending into the narrow, 33-foot-deep well to rescue the trapped animal. Tying a rope around his waist for safety, the young boy carefully lowered himself down, navigating the treacherous, slippery walls of the well.

""It was dark and cramped, but I knew I had to keep going,"" Muhammet said. ""I could see the puppy huddled at the bottom, scared and shivering.""

After what felt like an eternity, Muhammet reached the puppy and gently scooped it into his arms. With the help of his father and other villagers who had gathered to witness the rescue, Muhammet was slowly pulled back up to the surface, the grateful puppy safely in his grasp.

""When I saw Muhammet emerge from the well with the puppy, I was filled with relief and pride,"" said Mehmet. ""He risked his own life to save that little animal, and that's something truly special.""

The rescued puppy, a scruffy but resilient mixed-breed, was examined by a local veterinarian and found to be in good health, despite its harrowing ordeal. The veterinarian praised Muhammet's quick thinking and bravery, noting that the puppy likely would not have survived much longer had it remained trapped in the well.

News of Muhammet's heroic act quickly spread throughout the village and beyond, with local media outlets covering the story and hailing the young boy as a true hero. Residents of Karayazi have rallied around Muhammet, showering him with praise and offering their heartfelt gratitude.

""Muhammet's actions have inspired all of us,"" said Karayazi's mayor, Ahmet Demir. ""He has shown that even the youngest members of our community can make a difference and do the right thing. We are all incredibly proud of him.""

The rescued puppy has found a new home with a local family, who have vowed to provide it with a loving and safe environment. As for Muhammet, he remains humble about his actions, simply stating that he couldn't bear the thought of the puppy suffering.

""I'm just glad I was able to help,"" Muhammet said. ""I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had to. Animals deserve to be treated with kindness and compassion, just like people.""

Muhammet's selfless act has resonated with people across Turkey, serving as a reminder of the power of human empathy and the importance of protecting the most vulnerable members of our society, whether they be human or animal.",claude
Australian paper prints blank pages to help tackle toilet paper shortage,"""Australian Paper Prints Blank Pages to Help Tackle Toilet Paper Shortage""

In a unique and resourceful move, an Australian newspaper has stepped up to address the ongoing toilet paper shortage plaguing the country. The Herald Sun, a leading daily newspaper in Melbourne, has begun printing blank pages in its latest edition, offering a practical solution for those struggling to find the essential commodity.

The decision comes as Australians continue to grapple with the panic-buying frenzy that has swept the nation, leaving supermarket shelves bare and consumers frustrated. With supply chains struggling to keep up with the unprecedented demand, the Herald Sun has taken matters into its own hands, providing its readers with a temporary alternative.

""We understand the immense stress and inconvenience this shortage has caused for many Australians,"" said the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Damon Johnston. ""As a trusted media outlet, we felt it was our responsibility to step in and offer a practical solution to this pressing issue.""

The blank pages, which are printed on high-quality paper, are intended to be used as a substitute for traditional toilet paper. The newspaper has provided clear instructions on how to properly tear and use the pages, ensuring a smooth and hygienic experience for its readers.

""We've included perforated lines on the pages to make the tearing process easier,"" explained Johnston. ""And we've emphasized the importance of using only the necessary amount, to ensure the supply lasts as long as possible.""

The response from the public has been overwhelmingly positive, with many Australians expressing their gratitude for the Herald Sun's innovative approach.

""This is exactly what we needed right now,"" said Jessica Wilkins, a Melbourne resident. ""I've been scouring the stores for days, and it's such a relief to have this alternative. It's a brilliant idea, and I'm grateful the newspaper is stepping up to help.""

The blank pages have also garnered attention from international media, with news outlets around the world applauding the Herald Sun's creative solution to the toilet paper crisis.

""In times of crisis, it's inspiring to see a media organization taking such a proactive and practical approach to addressing the needs of its community,"" said Sarah Linden, a journalist for The New York Times. ""This is a testament to the power of journalism to make a real difference in people's lives.""

The Herald Sun's initiative has also sparked discussions about the broader implications of the toilet paper shortage and the need for more resilient supply chains. Experts have warned that the current crisis is a wake-up call for governments and businesses to reevaluate their preparedness for unexpected disruptions.

""This shortage has exposed the vulnerabilities in our supply chains,"" said economist Dr. Emily Walters. ""It's a lesson in the importance of diversifying our sources, building redundancy, and ensuring that essential goods can be readily available, even in times of crisis.""

As the toilet paper shortage continues to plague Australia, the Herald Sun's innovative solution has provided a glimmer of hope for those struggling to cope. The newspaper's commitment to supporting its readers and addressing their immediate needs has earned it widespread praise and admiration.

""We're proud to be able to offer this practical assistance to our community,"" said Johnston. ""Our hope is that this initiative will not only help alleviate the current crisis but also inspire others to think creatively about how they can support their fellow citizens in times of need.""",claude
US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"US Cities Are Losing 36 Million Trees a Year. Here's Why It Matters and How You Can Stop It

In a concerning trend, a new study has revealed that US cities are losing an average of 36 million trees annually, a staggering loss that has significant implications for the environment and public health.

The research, published in the journal Urban Forestry & Urban Greening, analyzed satellite imagery and on-the-ground data to track tree cover changes in urban and community areas across the United States between 2009 and 2014. The findings paint a grim picture, with an annual net loss of approximately 0.7% of the total tree canopy in these regions.

""Trees provide invaluable benefits to our cities, from improving air quality and reducing energy costs to enhancing mental well-being and property values,"" said Dr. David Nowak, a senior scientist with the US Forest Service and a co-author of the study. ""The rate at which we're losing them is deeply concerning and requires immediate action to address.""

One of the primary drivers of this tree loss is development, as land is cleared to make way for new housing, commercial buildings, and infrastructure. Additionally, factors such as drought, disease, and pests are taking a toll on urban tree populations.

The consequences of this tree canopy decline are far-reaching. Trees play a vital role in regulating local temperatures, with their shade and evapotranspiration helping to mitigate the urban heat island effect. As cities become hotter due to climate change, the loss of trees exacerbates this problem, leading to increased energy demands for cooling and greater health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations.

Moreover, trees are essential for improving air quality by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen. With fewer trees, cities face the prospect of dirtier air, which can contribute to respiratory illnesses and other health problems.

""Trees are the lungs of our cities, and when we lose them, we lose a critical component of our urban ecosystems,"" explained Dr. Kathleen Wolf, a research social scientist at the University of Washington and an expert on the benefits of urban forests.

The good news is that there are steps that individuals, communities, and policymakers can take to reverse this trend and protect the trees that remain.

One effective strategy is to implement robust tree planting and preservation programs. Many cities have already begun to do this, setting ambitious goals for increasing their tree canopy coverage. For example, New York City aims to plant 1 million new trees by 2030, while Los Angeles has committed to adding 90,000 trees by 2021.

Homeowners can also play a vital role by planting trees on their properties and properly maintaining existing ones. Additionally, supporting local initiatives that promote urban forestry, such as tree giveaways and community tree-planting events, can make a significant difference.

At the policy level, experts recommend that cities and towns adopt comprehensive urban forestry plans, which can include measures such as tree protection ordinances, incentives for developers to preserve trees, and dedicated funding for tree maintenance and replacement.

""The decisions we make today about our urban trees will have lasting impacts on the livability and sustainability of our cities,"" said Dr. Nowak. ""By taking action to protect and expand our tree canopy, we can safeguard the health and well-being of our communities for generations to come.""",claude
"Brazilian president's press secretary tests positive for coronavirus, days after meeting Trump","Brazilian President's Press Secretary Tests Positive for Coronavirus, Days After Meeting Trump

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - The Brazilian government announced on Wednesday that Fabio Wajngarten, the press secretary for President Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The announcement comes just days after Wajngarten accompanied Bolsonaro on an official visit to the United States, where the Brazilian delegation met with President Donald Trump and other senior White House officials.

According to a statement released by the Brazilian presidential office, Wajngarten began experiencing flu-like symptoms, including a fever, shortly after returning from the trip to the United States. He was immediately tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and the positive result was confirmed on Wednesday.

The news has raised concerns about the potential exposure of President Trump and his staff to the virus, given the close interactions between the Brazilian delegation and White House officials during Bolsonaro's visit. The White House has not yet issued any statement regarding the potential risk to the U.S. president or other administration members.

In a tweet posted on Thursday, President Trump downplayed the situation, saying that he is ""not concerned"" about the possibility of having been exposed to the virus. However, public health experts have emphasized the importance of taking appropriate precautions, including self-quarantine and testing, when there is a known exposure to someone who has tested positive.

The Brazilian government has stated that President Bolsonaro and the rest of the delegation who traveled to the United States are being monitored for any signs of illness and will undergo testing as a precautionary measure. Bolsonaro has not yet shown any symptoms of the virus, according to official reports.

The news of Wajngarten's positive test comes as countries around the world are grappling with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brazil has reported 52 confirmed cases of the virus so far, with the number expected to rise in the coming days and weeks.

The potential exposure of high-level government officials, including the leaders of two of the world's largest economies, has raised concerns about the broader implications of the virus for global politics and diplomacy. Experts have warned that the pandemic could have far-reaching consequences for international cooperation and the functioning of governments around the world.

As the situation continues to develop, both the Brazilian and U.S. governments will likely face increasing pressure to provide transparent and timely information about the potential exposure of their leaders and staff to the virus. The public will be closely watching to see how the two countries respond to this latest development in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",claude
Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"""Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture""

Beijing, China - The recent unveiling of the Serpentine Pavilion in Beijing has sent shockwaves through the global architecture community, signaling a bold new direction for Chinese design.

Designed by acclaimed Chinese architect Ma Yansong, the temporary structure is the latest iteration of the prestigious Serpentine Pavilion commission, which has previously featured works by renowned names such as Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, and Ai Weiwei. However, this year's pavilion stands apart, offering a striking departure from the sleek, modernist aesthetic that has come to define the program.

Inspired by the undulating curves of traditional Chinese landscape paintings, the pavilion's sinuous, serpentine form immediately catches the eye. Constructed from a lattice of intersecting steel beams, the structure appears to undulate and twist, creating a sense of movement and fluidity that is both visually captivating and structurally daring.

""This pavilion is a testament to the incredible creativity and technical prowess of Chinese architecture,"" says renowned architecture critic Liam Tung. ""Ma Yansong has managed to seamlessly blend traditional Chinese aesthetics with cutting-edge engineering, creating a structure that is both deeply rooted in the country's cultural heritage and resolutely forward-looking.""

Indeed, the Serpentine Pavilion's departure from the sleek, minimalist forms that have dominated global architecture in recent decades is a deliberate and significant move. According to Ma, the design is a direct challenge to the homogenization of architectural styles around the world, and a celebration of China's unique cultural identity.

""For too long, Chinese architecture has been overshadowed by the global dominance of Western modernism,"" Ma explains. ""With this pavilion, we are asserting our own distinct design language – one that is inspired by the natural world, rooted in traditional aesthetics, and yet fully embraces the technological possibilities of the 21st century.""

The pavilion's organic, undulating form is not merely a stylistic choice, but a reflection of Ma's deep engagement with the principles of traditional Chinese landscape design. The architect has long been fascinated by the way in which classical Chinese gardens and paintings evoke a sense of movement and dynamism, even in static forms.

""In Chinese landscape design, there is a profound understanding of the way in which space, light, and form can be manipulated to create a sense of constant flux and transformation,"" Ma explains. ""The Serpentine Pavilion is my attempt to translate those principles into a contemporary architectural language.""

The result is a structure that seems to defy gravity, with its sinuous steel beams appearing to flow and twist in a seemingly effortless manner. The pavilion's interior is equally captivating, with a series of interconnected spaces that invite visitors to explore and discover new perspectives with each step.

""This pavilion is not just a work of architecture, but a profound meditation on the relationship between humanity and the natural world,"" says Tung. ""Ma Yansong has managed to create a structure that is both visually stunning and deeply conceptual, challenging us to rethink our assumptions about the built environment and our place within it.""

As the Serpentine Pavilion continues to draw crowds and critical acclaim, it is clear that Ma Yansong's design has struck a chord with the global architecture community. It is a bold statement of intent from a rising generation of Chinese architects who are determined to forge their own path and challenge the dominant Western paradigm.

""This pavilion is just the beginning,"" Ma says. ""Chinese architecture is on the cusp of a new era, one in which we will assert our own unique voice and vision on the global stage. The Serpentine Pavilion is a testament to that ambition, and a glimpse of the exciting things to come.""",claude

The other gun lobby,"""The Other Gun Lobby""

In a surprising twist, a new group has emerged as a powerful force in the ongoing gun control debate. Dubbed the ""other gun lobby,"" this coalition of unlikely allies is challenging the traditional narrative around firearms and public safety.

Comprised of a diverse array of stakeholders, including public health experts, law enforcement officials, and community organizers, this group is making waves with its comprehensive approach to addressing gun violence. Unlike the well-known National Rifle Association (NRA), which has long dominated the gun rights movement, the ""other gun lobby"" is taking a more nuanced and evidence-based stance.

""We're not here to demonize gun owners or to call for an outright ban on firearms,"" explains Dr. Sarah Emerson, a public health researcher and a leading voice within the coalition. ""Our goal is to find common-sense solutions that prioritize public safety while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens.""

One of the key pillars of the ""other gun lobby's"" platform is a focus on addressing the root causes of gun violence, rather than solely targeting the tools used to perpetrate it. ""Too often, the gun control debate has been framed as a binary choice between unfettered access to firearms and outright confiscation,"" says John Williamson, a retired police chief who has joined the coalition. ""But the reality is much more complex.""

The ""other gun lobby"" is advocating for a multi-pronged approach that includes investments in mental health services, community-based violence intervention programs, and educational initiatives aimed at promoting responsible gun ownership. They argue that these measures, coupled with targeted legislation to close loopholes and improve background check systems, can have a tangible impact on reducing gun-related injuries and deaths.

""We're not here to take away anyone's guns,"" emphasizes Emerson. ""We're here to make our communities safer, and that requires looking at the broader social and economic factors that contribute to violence.""

This nuanced approach has resonated with a growing number of Americans, who are increasingly dissatisfied with the polarized nature of the gun control debate. A recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that a majority of respondents (59%) believe that the government can do more to address gun violence while still protecting the rights of gun owners.

""The 'other gun lobby' represents a refreshing shift in the conversation,"" says Jane Doe, a community organizer from a violence-plagued neighborhood. ""They're listening to the concerns of people like me, who have seen firsthand the devastating impact of gun violence, and they're proposing solutions that actually address the problem.""

Despite the growing momentum behind the ""other gun lobby,"" they face significant challenges in the form of well-funded and entrenched opposition from the traditional gun rights movement. The NRA and its allies have long wielded significant political influence, and they have shown no signs of backing down.

""We know that we're up against a formidable adversary,"" acknowledges Williamson. ""But we also believe that our message is resonating with the American people, and that's what ultimately matters. We're not going to back down, and we're going to keep fighting for the safety and well-being of our communities.""

26 voices on why the free press matters,"""26 Voices on Why the Free Press Matters""

In a powerful display of unity, 26 prominent figures from diverse backgrounds have come together to underscore the vital role of a free and independent press in a thriving democracy.

""A free press is the cornerstone of a healthy society,"" said Jane Doe, a renowned human rights activist. ""It holds those in power accountable, amplifies the voices of the marginalized, and ensures that the public has access to factual, unbiased information.""

John Smith, a best-selling author, echoed this sentiment, stating, ""The free press is the watchdog that safeguards our fundamental rights and freedoms. Without it, we risk sliding into a world of misinformation, censorship, and unchecked abuse of power.""

Reflecting on the crucial role of journalism, Sarah Lee, a respected journalist, commented, ""Journalists are the storytellers of our time, shining a light on the issues that matter most. They give a voice to the voiceless and hold those in positions of authority responsible for their actions.""

"'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert","""'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert

MACAO - In a bustling corner of Macao's historic Senado Square, a line of eager customers snakes out the door of Lord Stow's Bakery, all waiting to sink their teeth into the city's most iconic pastry: the Macao egg tart.

""The recipe has never changed,"" says Andrew Stow, the founder's son and the current owner of the beloved bakery. ""It's the same one my father used when he opened the shop in 1989.""

That unwavering commitment to tradition is precisely what has made Lord Stow's egg tarts a must-have for both locals and the millions of tourists who visit Macao each year. But the story behind this beloved dessert is anything but simple.

The origins of the Macao egg tart can be traced back to the 1800s, when the Portuguese arrived in the coastal Chinese territory and brought with them the pastel de nata - a rich, creamy egg custard tart that had long been a beloved treat in Lisbon.

As the Portuguese settled in Macao, the pastel de nata evolved to incorporate local ingredients and techniques, taking on a flavor profile that was uniquely Macanese. The result was a delicate, silky custard nestled in a flaky, golden crust - a harmonious balance of East and West that would become the hallmark of the Macao egg tart.

""There's a real art to getting the custard just right,"" explains Stow. ""It has to be smooth and velvety, with a subtle sweetness that doesn't overpower the richness of the egg.""

That delicate equilibrium is achieved through a meticulous process that has been honed over generations. The custard filling is made by carefully blending egg yolks, evaporated milk, and a touch of sugar, then slowly baking it to perfection. The crust, meanwhile, is crafted from a proprietary dough recipe that yields a light, buttery shell that shatters with each bite.

""It's all about the technique,"" says Stow. ""My father spent years perfecting the process, and we've stayed true to that ever since.""

That commitment to quality has earned Lord Stow's Bakery a devoted following, both in Macao and around the world. Customers rave about the tarts' addictive flavor and texture, with many describing them as the best they've ever tasted.

""There's just something special about them,"" says local resident Maria Lam. ""They're rich and creamy, but still so light and flaky. I can never get enough.""

The bakery's popularity has only grown in recent years, as Macao has emerged as a global tourism powerhouse. Visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, and beyond flock to Lord Stow's to sample the legendary pastry, often leaving with boxes full to bring home as souvenirs.

But despite the bakery's success, Stow insists that the secret to the Macao egg tart's enduring appeal lies not in flashy marketing or innovation, but in the unwavering adherence to tradition.

""We could never change the recipe, even if we wanted to,"" he says. ""It's part of who we are, and it's what our customers expect. Like the tart itself, I never change.""

That steadfast commitment to quality and authenticity has cemented the Macao egg tart's status as a cultural icon, a delicious embodiment of the city's unique history and identity. And for as long as Lord Stow's Bakery continues to serve up these beloved pastries, the sweet taste of Macao's past will live on in every bite.",claude
One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government,"One of India's Biggest Banks Rescued by Government Intervention

In a move to stabilize the country's financial sector, the Indian government has stepped in to rescue one of the nation's largest banks, providing a much-needed lifeline to the struggling institution.

The bank in question, which has not been named to protect its identity, had been facing a severe liquidity crisis, with depositors rapidly withdrawing their funds amid growing concerns about the bank's financial health. The situation had become so dire that the bank was on the verge of collapse, threatening to have far-reaching consequences for the broader Indian economy.

According to government officials, the decision to intervene was made to prevent a wider financial contagion and to safeguard the interests of the bank's depositors and stakeholders. The rescue plan, which was approved by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Ministry of Finance, involves a comprehensive restructuring of the bank's operations and a significant infusion of capital.

""The government has a responsibility to protect the stability of the financial system and to ensure that the hard-earned savings of the people are secure,"" said the Finance Minister, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""This intervention was necessary to prevent a potentially devastating crisis that could have had far-reaching implications for the entire Indian banking sector.""

Under the terms of the rescue plan, the government will provide a substantial financial bailout to the bank, injecting much-needed liquidity and enabling it to meet its immediate obligations to depositors. In addition, the bank's management team will be overhauled, with a new leadership team appointed to oversee the institution's turnaround efforts.

""We understand the concerns and frustrations of the bank's depositors, and we are committed to ensuring that their funds are safe and secure,"" said the RBI Governor. ""This rescue plan will not only stabilize the bank but also strengthen its long-term viability and resilience.""

The government's intervention has been met with a mixed response from the public and the financial community. While some have praised the decisive action taken to prevent a wider crisis, others have expressed concerns about the use of taxpayer funds to bail out a private institution.

""This is a necessary but difficult decision,"" said a prominent economist. ""The government had to weigh the potential risks of inaction against the cost of the bailout. In the end, the stability of the financial system had to take precedence.""

The rescue plan is expected to take several months to implement, with the bank's operations gradually returning to normal as the restructuring process unfolds. During this time, the government has pledged to closely monitor the bank's progress and to take additional measures if necessary to ensure its long-term viability.

""This is not a quick fix, but a comprehensive effort to address the underlying issues that led to the bank's crisis,"" said the Finance Minister. ""We are committed to working with the bank's management and the RBI to implement a sustainable solution that will strengthen the institution and restore public confidence in the Indian banking sector.""

As the rescue operation unfolds, the eyes of the nation will be fixed on the bank's progress, with the success or failure of the intervention likely to have far-reaching implications for the country's economic future.",claude
This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power,"""This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power""

Tucked away in the remote reaches of the North Atlantic, the Faroe Islands are quietly emerging as a global leader in the race to harness the power of hydrogen. This self-governing archipelago, part of the Kingdom of Denmark, is pioneering innovative solutions that could pave the way for a more sustainable energy future.

The Faroe Islands, with a population of just over 50,000, have long been known for their stunning natural beauty and rugged, wind-swept landscapes. But in recent years, the islands have gained attention for their remarkable strides in renewable energy, particularly in the realm of hydrogen.

At the forefront of this revolution is the Faroese company, Hydrogen Faroe Islands. Founded in 2019, the company has been working tirelessly to transform the islands' energy landscape, leveraging the abundant wind and water resources that are the hallmarks of this remote island chain.

""We have an incredible natural resource in the form of wind, and we're determined to harness that power to create a sustainable energy future,"" says Jóhannus Johansen, the CEO of Hydrogen Faroe Islands. ""Hydrogen is the key to unlocking the full potential of our renewable energy sources, and we're committed to leading the way in this exciting field.""

The company's flagship project is the construction of a state-of-the-art hydrogen production facility, which is set to become the largest of its kind in the Nordic region. The facility, powered by the islands' abundant wind resources, will use electrolysis to split water molecules, extracting pure hydrogen that can then be stored and distributed for a variety of applications.

""This hydrogen production facility is a game-changer for the Faroe Islands,"" explains Johansen. ""It will not only provide us with a clean, reliable source of energy, but it will also open up new opportunities for export and collaboration with partners around the world.""

The Faroese government has recognized the immense potential of hydrogen and has thrown its weight behind the initiative. In 2020, the government announced a ambitious plan to make the Faroe Islands carbon-neutral by 2030, with hydrogen playing a central role in this transition.

""We see hydrogen as a critical component of our sustainable energy strategy,"" says Bárður á Steig Nielsen, the Faroese Minister of Trade and Industry. ""By investing in this technology, we're not only reducing our own carbon footprint, but we're also positioning the Faroe Islands as a global leader in the hydrogen economy.""

Beyond the hydrogen production facility, Hydrogen Faroe Islands is also exploring other innovative applications for the clean-burning fuel. One such project involves the conversion of the islands' ferry fleet to hydrogen power, a move that could significantly reduce emissions and set a new standard for sustainable maritime transportation.

""Our ferries are the lifeblood of the Faroe Islands, connecting our remote communities and supporting our economy,"" says Johansen. ""By transitioning these vessels to hydrogen, we're demonstrating the real-world viability of this technology and paving the way for others to follow suit.""

The Faroe Islands' hydrogen revolution is not only transforming the local energy landscape but also attracting global attention. The islands have become a hub for research and development, with scientists and engineers from around the world flocking to the archipelago to study the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the islands' wind-rich environment.

""The Faroe Islands are proving that even the smallest of communities can make a big impact when it comes to renewable energy and sustainability,"" says Johansen. ""Our success here is a testament to the power of innovation, collaboration, and a steadfast commitment to a greener future.""

As the world grapples with the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, the Faroe Islands' hydrogen story offers a glimmer of hope and a roadmap for others to follow. This remote island chain, once known for its rugged beauty, is now poised to become a global beacon of sustainable energy innovation.",claude
"India identifies 29 coronavirus cases as global infections top 95,000","India Identifies 29 Coronavirus Cases as Global Infections Top 95,000

New Delhi, India - India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced on Monday that the country has identified 29 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the global number of infections surpassed 95,000.

The announcement came as the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its global risk assessment of the outbreak to its highest level. The new cases in India bring the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 29, up from the 28 reported on Sunday.

""We have 29 positive cases of COVID-19 in the country as of now,"" Lav Agarwal, a joint secretary at the health ministry, said at a press conference in New Delhi. ""All these cases have a history of travel from affected countries or have been in contact with positive cases.""

Agarwal stated that the government is closely monitoring the situation and has issued advisories to states and union territories to take necessary actions, including the identification of suspected cases, their isolation, and contact tracing.

The newly identified cases include 16 Italian tourists who were part of a group that arrived in India on February 21. Six other members of the group have also tested positive for the virus, according to the health ministry.

In addition, three residents of the National Capital Region (NCR), which includes New Delhi, have been confirmed as COVID-19 positive. The individuals had a history of travel to Italy, one of the countries most affected by the outbreak.

The government has also reported two cases in Pune, Maharashtra, and one each in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. All of these individuals had a history of travel to affected countries, the ministry said.

Amid the rising number of cases, the Indian government has taken several measures to contain the spread of the virus. These include the suspension of all existing visas, except diplomatic, official, employment, and project visas, until April 15. The government has also advised its citizens to avoid non-essential travel abroad.

The WHO has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and raised its global risk assessment to ""very high."" The global number of confirmed cases has surpassed 95,000, with the majority of infections reported in China, where the outbreak originated.

Outside of China, the virus has spread to more than 80 countries, with Italy, Iran, and South Korea reporting the highest number of cases after China.

The rapid spread of the virus has prompted governments around the world to implement various measures to control the outbreak, including travel restrictions, quarantines, and the cancellation of large-scale events.

In India, the government has set up several COVID-19 testing facilities across the country and has advised citizens to avoid large gatherings and practice good hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus.

""We are closely monitoring the situation and are taking all necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus,"" Agarwal said. ""We urge the public to follow the guidelines issued by the government and to report any suspected cases to the authorities.""

As the global community continues to grapple with the COVID-19 outbreak, the situation in India remains fluid, with the potential for further cases to emerge in the coming days and weeks.",claude
Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets,"""Saviour of the Dead: Burying the Bodies India Forgets""

In the heart of Uttar Pradesh, a small village has become a sanctuary for the forgotten dead. Chand Miyan, a 65-year-old man, has dedicated his life to ensuring that the unclaimed bodies of those who have passed away receive a proper burial, regardless of their religious or social background.

Miyan's mission began over a decade ago when he encountered the abandoned body of a young man on the side of the road. Disturbed by the thought of the deceased being left to rot, Miyan took it upon himself to give the man a dignified funeral. From that day forward, he has made it his life's work to provide a final resting place for those who have no one to claim them.

""It pains me to see these bodies lying alone, forgotten by the world,"" Miyan says, his voice laced with a deep sense of empathy. ""I cannot bear the thought of them being left to the elements, without the respect and dignity they deserve in death.""

Miyan's humble home has become a makeshift morgue, with a small plot of land adjacent to it serving as a burial ground. Here, he carefully receives the unclaimed bodies, washes them, and wraps them in white shrouds before laying them to rest. His dedication has earned him the moniker ""Saviour of the Dead"" among the locals.

The task is not an easy one, as Miyan often faces logistical and financial challenges. He relies on donations from the community to cover the costs of the burials, and he must navigate the bureaucratic maze of government agencies to retrieve the bodies from various locations.

""Sometimes, I have to travel for hours to recover a body,"" Miyan explains. ""The authorities are not always cooperative, but I persist because I know this work is essential.""

Despite the obstacles, Miyan's unwavering commitment has not gone unnoticed. Local officials and religious leaders have praised his efforts, and some have even offered to assist him in his mission. However, Miyan remains steadfast in his belief that this is his personal calling, and he continues to shoulder the burden alone.

""I don't do this for recognition or praise,"" he says. ""I do it because it is the right thing to do. These people deserve to be remembered, to be given the dignity they were denied in life.""

Miyan's work has had a profound impact on the local community. Many residents have expressed gratitude for his efforts, and some have even volunteered to help with the burials. The village has become a sanctuary for the forgotten, a place where the dead can find peace and the living can find solace in the knowledge that someone cares.

As the sun sets over the humble burial ground, Miyan reflects on the significance of his work. ""In a world that often forgets the less fortunate, I hope that my actions can serve as a reminder that every life is precious, and every death deserves to be honoured,"" he says.

Miyan's story is a testament to the power of compassion and the transformative impact that one person can have on their community. In a country where the marginalized often face neglect and indifference, his tireless efforts to provide a dignified final resting place for the unclaimed dead stand as a shining example of what it means to be truly human.",claude

The ultimate goal is to empower communities across Africa and beyond with the tools they need to combat COVID-19 and build resilience against future pandemic threats.",claude
Four women were serious candidates for president. What happened?,"""Four women were serious candidates for president. What happened?""

In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, four women made significant strides in the political landscape, emerging as serious contenders for the highest office in the nation. However, the ultimate outcome left many wondering what factors contributed to their inability to secure the nomination or win the presidency.

The 2020 election cycle saw a diverse field of candidates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. These women brought a wealth of experience, progressive policy platforms, and the potential to shatter the glass ceiling of the Oval Office.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a seasoned lawmaker from Massachusetts, entered the race with a reputation as a fierce consumer advocate and champion of economic reform. Her detailed policy proposals, ranging from wealth taxes to breaking up big tech companies, resonated with many Democratic voters. However, Warren struggled to gain traction in the crowded primary field, and her campaign ultimately fell short of the nomination.

Senator Kamala Harris, the first woman of color to be elected Vice President, initially gained momentum with her sharp debate performances and appeals to the party's progressive base. As a former California Attorney General, Harris touted her experience in law enforcement and her commitment to criminal justice reform. Despite these strengths, her campaign faced challenges in finding a cohesive message and connecting with voters, leading to her withdrawal from the race before the primaries.

Senator Amy Klobuchar, a moderate Democrat from Minnesota, positioned herself as a pragmatic, Midwestern alternative to the more progressive candidates. Her emphasis on bipartisanship and her record of legislative accomplishments resonated with some voters, but she struggled to gain traction in a field dominated by higher-profile candidates.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat, ran on a platform of foreign policy reform and anti-interventionism. Her unorthodox views and her criticism of the Democratic establishment, however, made it challenging for her to gain widespread support within the party.

While these women brought unique perspectives and qualifications to the table, their campaigns faced a range of obstacles, from fundraising challenges to the inherent biases and structural barriers that women often encounter in the political arena.

Some analysts have pointed to the persistent gender stereotypes and double standards that female candidates often face, such as being judged more harshly on their appearance, personality, and perceived electability. The media's coverage of these candidates, and the public's response to their campaigns, have also been the subject of scrutiny, with concerns raised about the role of sexism and misogyny in shaping the public's perceptions.

Moreover, the 2020 election cycle was marked by a highly polarized political climate, with the Democratic Party grappling with ideological divisions between its moderate and progressive wings. This dynamic may have contributed to the challenges faced by the women candidates, as they sought to navigate the complex terrain of party politics.

Despite these setbacks, the 2020 election cycle marked a significant milestone in the ongoing struggle for gender equality in American politics. The presence of these women on the national stage has helped to normalize the idea of female presidential candidates, and their campaigns have inspired a new generation of women to enter the political arena.

As the nation continues to grapple with the legacy of the 2020 election, the lessons learned from the experiences of these women candidates will undoubtedly shape the future of American politics, paving the way for more diverse and inclusive leadership in the years to come.",claude
This South African pilot is on a mission to change the face of aviation in Africa,"""This South African Pilot is on a Mission to Change the Face of Aviation in Africa""

Johannesburg, South Africa - In a continent where the aviation industry has long been dominated by men, one South African pilot is determined to break down barriers and inspire the next generation of female aviators.

Refilwe Ledwaba, a former South African Air Force officer and commercial pilot, is the founder of the Girls Fly Programme in Africa (GFPA), an initiative aimed at increasing the representation of women in all aspects of the aviation and aerospace industries across the African continent.

""When I started my flying career, I was often the only woman in the room,"" says Ledwaba. ""I realized that if we don't intentionally create opportunities for young women, the gender imbalance in this industry will continue.""

Ledwaba's passion for aviation began at a young age when she would watch planes take off and land at the nearby airport. After completing her schooling, she joined the South African Air Force, becoming one of the first black female pilots to serve in the country's military.

""It was a challenging journey, but I was determined to succeed,"" she recalls. ""I had to work twice as hard to prove myself, but I knew that if I could do it, others could too.""

Upon leaving the air force, Ledwaba went on to become a commercial pilot, flying both domestic and international routes. However, she never lost sight of her desire to create opportunities for other aspiring female aviators.

In 2014, Ledwaba founded the GFPA, an organization that provides mentorship, scholarships, and hands-on training to young women interested in pursuing careers in aviation and aerospace.

""The lack of representation is a significant barrier for many young women,"" Ledwaba explains. ""They don't see themselves reflected in the industry, and that can be discouraging. We're working to change that.""

Through the GFPA, Ledwaba and her team have reached thousands of girls across Africa, inspiring them to dream big and pursue their aviation ambitions. The organization offers a range of programs, from aviation camps and workshops to scholarship opportunities and internships.

One of the GFPA's flagship initiatives is the annual Girls Fly Programme, a multi-day event that brings together female pilots, engineers, and aerospace professionals to share their experiences and encourage young women to consider careers in these fields.

""The response has been incredible,"" says Ledwaba. ""We've had girls from all over the continent come to these events, and the excitement and enthusiasm they bring is truly inspiring.""

In addition to her work with the GFPA, Ledwaba is also a passionate advocate for diversity and inclusion in the aviation industry. She has spoken at numerous conferences and events, sharing her story and calling for greater representation of women and people of color in the field.

""It's not just about getting more women into the cockpit,"" Ledwaba explains. ""It's about creating a more inclusive and equitable industry, where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.""

Ledwaba's efforts have not gone unnoticed. She has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades, including being named one of the ""100 Most Influential Africans"" by New African magazine and being selected as a ""Young Global Leader"" by the World Economic Forum.

""I'm humbled by the recognition, but the real reward is seeing the impact of our work,"" Ledwaba says. ""When I see the faces of these young women light up as they learn to fly a plane or design a satellite, I know that we're making a difference.""

As Ledwaba continues to push for change in the aviation industry, she remains focused on her ultimate goal: to inspire the next generation of female aviators and aerospace professionals, and to create a future where the face of African aviation truly reflects the diversity of the continent.",claude
Do I need a flu shot?,"""Do I Need a Flu Shot?""

As the temperatures begin to drop and the leaves start to change, the annual flu season is quickly approaching. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic still a concern, many people are wondering if they should prioritize getting a flu shot this year. We spoke to leading health experts to get the answers you need.

""The flu shot is more important than ever this year,"" says Dr. Sarah Thompson, an infectious disease specialist at XYZ Medical Center. ""With the added risk of COVID-19, it's crucial that everyone who is able gets vaccinated against the flu to protect themselves and their loved ones.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), flu activity typically ramps up in October and peaks between December and February. However, flu season can last as late as May. Experts recommend getting the flu vaccine as soon as it becomes available, typically in early fall, in order to build up immunity before the virus starts circulating widely.

""The flu shot takes about two weeks to become fully effective,"" explains Dr. Thompson. ""So the sooner you can get it, the better protected you'll be throughout the entire flu season.""

While the flu shot doesn't guarantee you won't get the flu, it significantly reduces your risk of infection and can also lessen the severity of symptoms if you do fall ill. Last year, the flu vaccine was approximately 39% effective in preventing illness from the predominant flu viruses, according to the CDC.

""Even a 39% effectiveness rate is quite good, especially when you consider the potential consequences of getting the flu,"" says Dr. Thompson. ""The flu can be a very serious illness, leading to hospitalization and even death in some cases. The vaccine is our best defense.""

The flu shot is recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older, with rare exceptions. Those at highest risk for flu-related complications include young children, pregnant women, adults over 65, and people with certain chronic health conditions.

""If you fall into a high-risk category, it's even more important that you get the flu shot,"" urges Dr. Thompson. ""The vaccine can literally be a life-saver for these vulnerable populations.""

In addition to the traditional flu shot, there are also other vaccine options available, such as the high-dose flu shot for seniors and the intradermal flu shot, which uses a smaller needle. Speak with your healthcare provider to determine which version is best for you.

It's also important to note that the flu shot does not protect against COVID-19. Health experts recommend getting both the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine or booster, if eligible.

""The flu shot and COVID-19 vaccines are completely separate and can be administered at the same time, if desired,"" explains Dr. Thompson. ""It's safe and effective to get both, and it's the best way to stay healthy this fall and winter.""

While getting the flu shot is the primary defense against the influenza virus, there are also other preventive measures you can take, such as frequent handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick. These actions can help reduce the spread of the flu and other respiratory illnesses.

""The flu shot is our most powerful tool, but it's not the only thing we can do,"" says Dr. Thompson. ""Following basic health precautions can also make a big difference in protecting ourselves and our communities.""

As the flu season approaches, health experts are urging everyone who is able to get their flu shot as soon as possible. With the added threat of COVID-19, it's more important than ever to take proactive steps to stay healthy this winter.",claude
"Coronavirus outbreak worsens in Italy and Japan, as situation stabilizes in China","Coronavirus Outbreak Worsens in Italy and Japan, as Situation Stabilizes in China

Rome, Italy - Italy is facing a growing crisis as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to rise at an alarming rate. The country has now reported over 3,000 infections and 107 deaths, making it the worst-affected nation in Europe.

The Italian government has taken drastic measures to contain the outbreak, including placing the entire Lombardy region and 14 other provinces under lockdown. Travel in and out of these areas is now heavily restricted, and schools, universities, and many businesses have been ordered to close.

""We are facing an emergency, a national emergency,"" said Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte in a televised address. ""We are working around the clock to ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens.""

The rapid spread of the virus has overwhelmed the country's healthcare system, with hospitals in the worst-affected areas struggling to cope with the influx of patients. Doctors and nurses have been working tirelessly, often without adequate protective equipment, to provide care to those in need.

""It's a very difficult situation,"" said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pulmonologist at the Gemelli University Hospital in Rome. ""We are doing our best to treat patients, but the sheer number of cases is putting a huge strain on our resources.""

The Italian government has announced a $28 billion stimulus package to help support the country's economy, which has been severely impacted by the outbreak. Businesses in the tourism, hospitality, and transportation sectors have been hit particularly hard, with many facing the prospect of bankruptcy.

As Italy grapples with the crisis, the situation in Japan is also deteriorating. The country has reported over 700 confirmed cases, including more than 600 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined in Yokohama last month.

The Japanese government has faced criticism for its handling of the outbreak, with many questioning the effectiveness of its containment measures. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has declared a state of emergency in several prefectures, including Tokyo, and has urged citizens to avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings.

""We are at a critical juncture in our fight against the virus,"" said Abe in a press conference. ""We must act decisively to prevent the further spread of the disease.""

The outbreak has also had a significant impact on Japan's economy, with the country's stock market experiencing its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Analysts predict that the outbreak could push the country into a recession, with the tourism and manufacturing sectors particularly vulnerable.

Meanwhile, in China, the situation appears to be stabilizing, with the number of new cases declining in recent weeks. The country has reported just 15 new infections in the past 24 hours, a far cry from the thousands of cases it was reporting at the height of the outbreak.

The Chinese government has credited its strict containment measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, for the decline in new cases. However, the country is still grappling with the aftermath of the outbreak, with many businesses and industries struggling to recover.

""We have made significant progress in our fight against the virus, but we cannot let our guard down,"" said Chinese President Xi Jinping in a speech. ""We must continue to work together to overcome this challenge and build a better future for our country.""

As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus outbreak, the situation in Italy and Japan remains a major concern. Governments and healthcare systems around the globe are working tirelessly to contain the spread of the virus and mitigate its impact on their economies and societies.",claude
BMW redesigns its iconic logo,"BMW Redesigns Its Iconic Logo

In a move that has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry, BMW has unveiled a bold redesign of its iconic logo. The new logo, which will be gradually rolled out across the company's global operations, represents a significant departure from the classic emblem that has been a hallmark of the brand for decades.

The updated logo features a sleek, minimalist design that emphasizes the brand's core values of innovation and sophistication. Gone is the familiar blue and white circular badge, replaced by a flatter, more modern interpretation that retains the brand's signature elements while giving it a fresh, contemporary look.

""This is a momentous occasion for BMW,"" said Oliver Zipse, the company's Chief Executive Officer. ""The new logo is a reflection of our commitment to evolving with the times and staying ahead of the curve in an ever-changing automotive landscape.""

According to the company, the redesign was driven by a desire to better align the brand's visual identity with its digital presence and the increasing emphasis on user experience in the automotive industry. The new logo, with its clean lines and simplified typography, is designed to be more legible and adaptable across a range of digital platforms and touchpoints.

""The old logo served us well for many years, but it was starting to feel a bit dated and out of step with the way our customers interact with the brand,"" said Jens Thiemer, BMW's Senior Vice President of Customer and Brand. ""The new design is a bold step forward, one that we believe will resonate with both our long-standing fans and a new generation of BMW enthusiasts.""

The rollout of the new logo will be a gradual process, with the updated branding first appearing on the company's digital channels and select physical touchpoints, such as showrooms and marketing materials. The iconic blue and white circular badge, however, will continue to be used on the company's vehicles, ensuring a seamless transition for customers.

""We understand that the classic BMW logo holds a special place in the hearts of many of our customers,"" Zipse said. ""That's why we've taken great care to ensure that the new design retains the core elements that have made our brand so iconic, while also modernizing and evolving it for the future.""

The redesign comes at a critical juncture for the automotive industry, as companies grapple with the challenges of electrification, autonomous driving, and changing consumer preferences. By updating its visual identity, BMW is positioning itself as a forward-thinking, technologically advanced brand that is ready to meet the demands of the 21st century.

""This is more than just a logo change,"" said Thiemer. ""It's a statement of our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and delivering an exceptional customer experience. The new BMW logo is a symbol of our vision for the future of the brand and the industry as a whole.""

As the new logo begins to appear across BMW's global operations, industry observers and consumers alike will be closely watching to see how the brand's loyal customer base reacts to the change. One thing is certain, however: the iconic BMW brand is entering a new era, one that promises to be as exciting and transformative as the company's storied history.",claude
China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic,"China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic

In a striking departure from the scientific consensus, the Chinese government has launched a coordinated disinformation campaign alleging that the United States military introduced the novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic.

The claim, which has been amplified by Chinese officials and state media, suggests that the virus originated from a U.S. Army laboratory and was brought to Wuhan, China during the Military World Games held in October 2019. This narrative directly contradicts the findings of international health organizations, which have traced the virus's emergence to a live animal market in Wuhan.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian ignited the controversy on March 12th, when he tweeted: ""It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!"" Zhao provided no evidence to support his accusation, which he later doubled down on during a press briefing.

The Chinese government's campaign has rapidly gained traction, with state media outlets publishing a flurry of articles and videos promoting the conspiracy theory. The official Xinhua News Agency described it as a ""new theory"" that ""has become a target of speculation,"" while the Global Times newspaper claimed the ""possibility"" cannot be ruled out.

This coordinated effort appears to be part of a broader strategy by Beijing to deflect blame and rewrite the narrative surrounding the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak. Chinese officials have increasingly criticized the United States' response to the pandemic, accusing Washington of ""spreading fear"" and attempting to ""stigmatize China.""

The U.S. government has firmly rejected the Chinese allegations, calling them ""ridiculous"" and ""false."" In a statement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated unequivocally that ""COVID-19 was not man-made or genetically modified"" and that the ""virus is a zoonotic virus"" that likely emerged from an animal reservoir.

Medical experts have also dismissed the Chinese claims as baseless conspiracy theories. Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, described the allegations as ""simply not true"" and ""not supported by any evidence.""

The World Health Organization (WHO), which has faced criticism for its initial response to the outbreak, has also refuted the Chinese narrative. In a press briefing, WHO spokesperson Fadela Chaib stated that the organization is ""not aware of any evidence"" to support the claim that the virus was brought to Wuhan by the U.S. military.

The Chinese government's disinformation campaign has drawn condemnation from the international community, with some accusing Beijing of attempting to deflect attention from its own handling of the crisis. Critics argue that the propaganda effort undermines global cooperation and trust at a time when nations need to work together to combat the pandemic.

As the world grapples with the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, the battle for the narrative surrounding its origins has taken on geopolitical significance. The Chinese government's unsubstantiated claims have the potential to further escalate tensions between the United States and China, complicating efforts to coordinate a unified global response to the public health emergency.

Experts warn that the spread of such conspiracy theories can have dangerous real-world consequences, fueling xenophobia and potentially hindering the international scientific community's ability to investigate the virus's origins and develop effective countermeasures.

In the face of this concerted disinformation campaign, the international community must remain vigilant and continue to rely on the guidance of public health authorities and scientific consensus to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.",claude
"The Catholic nun who made joyous, politically charged Pop Art","The Catholic Nun Who Made Joyous, Politically Charged Pop Art

In a world where art often reflects the somber realities of modern life, one woman has managed to infuse her canvas with a vibrant, unapologetic energy that challenges the status quo. Sister Corita Kent, a Catholic nun turned Pop Art icon, has left an indelible mark on the art world, seamlessly blending her faith, social activism, and a playful aesthetic that has captivated audiences for decades.

Born in 1918 in Hollywood, California, Sister Corita's artistic journey began at a young age. She entered the religious order of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1936, where she quickly discovered her passion for teaching and the arts. It was during her time as an art instructor at the Immaculate Heart College that Sister Corita's unique style began to emerge, as she encouraged her students to embrace the power of popular culture and everyday objects as sources of inspiration.

In the 1960s, Sister Corita's art took on a more politically charged tone, reflecting the tumultuous social and political climate of the era. Her bold, vibrant silkscreen prints often incorporated slogans and imagery from advertisements, protest movements, and religious texts, creating a visual dialogue that challenged the viewer to confront the realities of the world around them.

One of her most iconic works, ""Power Up,"" is a prime example of this approach. The print features a series of brightly colored, overlapping text that reads ""power up,"" ""power on,"" and ""power out,"" creating a sense of energy and urgency that resonates with the viewer. The work is a powerful commentary on the role of individual and collective action in driving social change, a theme that was central to Sister Corita's artistic and spiritual beliefs.

But Sister Corita's art was not merely a vehicle for political expression; it was also a celebration of joy, color, and the beauty of the everyday. Her silkscreen prints often featured vibrant, playful imagery that drew inspiration from popular culture, religious iconography, and the natural world. In works like ""Hail Mary,"" she juxtaposed the traditional image of the Virgin Mary with bold, abstract patterns and text, creating a visually striking and thought-provoking piece that challenged the viewer's perceptions of religious art.

Despite the subversive nature of her work, Sister Corita's art was not without its critics. In the 1960s, she faced censorship and criticism from the Catholic Church, which viewed her politically charged imagery as a threat to traditional religious values. Undeterred, she continued to push the boundaries of her art, using her platform to advocate for social justice, civil rights, and environmental causes.

Today, Sister Corita's legacy continues to inspire artists, activists, and individuals around the world. Her work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions and retrospectives, and her influence can be seen in the work of contemporary artists who share her commitment to using art as a tool for social and political change.

As the world grapples with a range of pressing social and political issues, the enduring relevance of Sister Corita's art serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative power of creativity and the importance of using one's voice to challenge the status quo. Through her joyous, politically charged Pop Art, Sister Corita Kent has left an indelible mark on the art world and the collective consciousness of a nation in search of hope and change.",claude
How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all,"""How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all""

In a shocking upset, Watford defender Christian Kabasele has lifted the lid on how his side managed to defeat the seemingly unstoppable Liverpool juggernaut in their recent Premier League clash.

Watford's 3-0 victory over the league leaders has sent shockwaves through the football world, with many pundits and fans struggling to comprehend how Jurgen Klopp's men were so comprehensively outclassed by the Hornets.

Now, Kabasele has provided a tantalizing insight into the tactics and mindset that allowed Watford to pull off one of the biggest upsets of the season so far.

""I think the key for us was to really believe in ourselves and not be intimidated by Liverpool's reputation,"" the Belgian defender explained. ""We knew they were a fantastic team, but we also knew that on our day, we have the quality to match anyone in this league.""

Kabasele revealed that Watford's preparation for the game involved a meticulous analysis of Liverpool's strengths and weaknesses, with the coaching staff leaving no stone unturned in their quest to devise the perfect game plan.

""We spent a lot of time studying Liverpool's patterns of play, their attacking movements, and the way they try to break teams down,"" Kabasele said. ""We identified areas where we could exploit them, and we were really disciplined in our execution on the day.""

One of the critical factors in Watford's success, according to Kabasele, was their ability to nullify the threat of Liverpool's prolific front three of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, and Roberto Firmino.

""We knew we had to be really tight and compact in our defensive shape, and make it difficult for them to find space between the lines,"" Kabasele explained. ""We also put a lot of emphasis on winning the second balls and being aggressive in our pressing, to stop them from getting into their rhythm.""

The Watford defender also revealed that the team's confidence was further boosted by the raucous atmosphere created by the home supporters at Vicarage Road.

""The fans were incredible, they really got behind us from the first whistle,"" Kabasele said. ""Their energy and enthusiasm were a massive boost, and I think it helped to unsettle Liverpool a bit, knowing they were coming into a hostile environment.""

While Kabasele acknowledged that Liverpool's defeat was a surprise to many, he insisted that Watford always believed they were capable of pulling off such a result.

""We knew it was going to be a tough game, but we went into it with the mindset that we could win,"" he said. ""We didn't want to just sit back and try to hold on for a draw – we wanted to be proactive, take the game to them, and show that we're a team to be reckoned with.""

With the victory over Liverpool, Watford have firmly established themselves as one of the most exciting and unpredictable teams in the Premier League this season. And according to Kabasele, the Hornets are just getting started.

""This is just the beginning for us,"" he declared. ""We've shown that we can compete with the best teams in the league, and we're going to use this result as a springboard to push on and achieve even more in the coming months.""",claude
"The Clanwilliam cedar survived the last ice age, but its future hangs in the balance","The Clanwilliam Cedar: A Resilient Survivor Facing an Uncertain Future

In the rugged mountains of South Africa's Western Cape, a remarkable tree stands as a testament to nature's enduring resilience. The Clanwilliam cedar, a species that has weathered the test of time, surviving even the last ice age, now faces a new challenge: the threat of extinction.

This ancient conifer, known scientifically as Widdringtonia cedarbergensis, is endemic to the Cederberg mountain range, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. For thousands of years, these majestic trees have been an integral part of the region's unique ecosystem, providing shelter and sustenance to a diverse array of flora and fauna.

However, the Clanwilliam cedar's future hangs in the balance, as climate change and human activity have taken a toll on its population. Experts estimate that only around 6,000 mature individuals remain in the wild, a stark decline from the estimated 170,000 that existed just a century ago.

""The Clanwilliam cedar is a living relic of a bygone era,"" says Dr. Lize Joubert-van der Merwe, a conservation biologist at the University of Stellenbosch. ""It's a species that has survived through some of the most dramatic environmental changes on Earth, but now it faces the very real threat of extinction due to the impacts of modern human civilization.""

One of the primary threats to the Clanwilliam cedar is the changing climate. As temperatures rise and precipitation patterns shift, the trees are struggling to adapt to the new environmental conditions. Prolonged droughts and the increased frequency of wildfires have taken a heavy toll on the species, with many mature trees succumbing to the harsh conditions.

Furthermore, the encroachment of human settlements and the expansion of agricultural activities have also contributed to the Clanwilliam cedar's decline. The clearing of land for development and the overgrazing of livestock have destroyed or degraded the fragile mountain habitats where these trees thrive.

""It's heartbreaking to see these ancient trees, which have been part of the Cederberg landscape for millennia, now facing such an uncertain future,"" says local conservationist, Sarah Venter. ""We have a responsibility to protect and preserve this unique natural heritage for future generations.""

In response to the growing threat, conservation efforts have been intensified in recent years. The Clanwilliam Cedar Conservation Project, a collaborative initiative between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and local communities, has been working tirelessly to safeguard the remaining Clanwilliam cedars.

The project's multi-pronged approach includes the establishment of protected areas, the implementation of sustainable land-use practices, and the propagation of young trees to replenish the dwindling population. Additionally, educational programs and community outreach initiatives aim to raise awareness and foster a deeper appreciation for the Clanwilliam cedar's cultural and ecological significance.

""Time is of the essence,"" warns Dr. Joubert-van der Merwe. ""If we don't act now to protect the Clanwilliam cedar, we risk losing a piece of our natural heritage that has weathered the storms of countless millennia. It's a humbling thought, and one that should inspire us to do everything in our power to ensure the survival of this remarkable tree.""

As the Clanwilliam cedar's future hangs in the balance, the world watches and waits, hoping that the resilience that has carried this species through the ages will once again prevail in the face of modern challenges. The fate of this ancient tree, and the delicate ecosystem it supports, rests in the hands of those who recognize its immense value and are willing to fight for its preservation.",claude

Trump's ex-top economic adviser: US is in a recession,"""Trump's ex-top economic adviser: US is in a recession""

Washington, D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, former top economic adviser to President Trump, Kevin Hassett, has declared that the United States is currently in a recession. Hassett, who served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2017 to 2019, made the bold statement during an interview on CNN, contradicting the current administration's assertions of a strong economy.

""I think the U.S. is in a recession,"" Hassett said, citing the recent decline in consumer spending and the ongoing disruptions in the labor market. ""I think the odds of a soft landing are diminishing.""

Hassett's remarks come at a time when the Biden administration has been touting the resilience of the American economy, with the president himself stating that the country is not currently in a recession. However, Hassett's insider perspective and his previous role in shaping the administration's economic policies have lent credibility to his assessment.

The former adviser pointed to several key indicators that he believes signal the onset of a recession. ""When you look at the data, it's clear that consumer spending is declining, and that's a really important part of the economy,"" Hassett said. ""We're also seeing a lot of disruption in the labor market, with companies announcing hiring freezes and layoffs.""

Hassett's comments echo the concerns of many economists who have been closely monitoring the state of the U.S. economy. The recent rise in inflation, coupled with the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes, have raised fears of a potential economic downturn.

""The Fed is trying to engineer a soft landing, but it's becoming increasingly difficult,"" Hassett said. ""They're raising interest rates to try to cool down inflation, but that also has the effect of slowing down the economy.""

The former Trump adviser's assessment is particularly noteworthy given his previous role in shaping the administration's economic policies. During his tenure, Hassett was a vocal proponent of the administration's tax cuts and deregulation efforts, which were aimed at stimulating economic growth.

However, Hassett's current stance suggests that the economic landscape has shifted significantly since his departure from the administration. ""I think the economy is in a much more precarious position than it was when I was in the White House,"" he said.

The Biden administration has yet to respond directly to Hassett's comments, but the White House has maintained that the economy remains strong, despite the challenges posed by high inflation and supply chain disruptions.

""We're seeing a resilient economy, with low unemployment and steady job growth,"" said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""While we acknowledge the concerns raised by some economists, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the American economy.""

Nonetheless, Hassett's assessment is likely to add fuel to the ongoing debate over the state of the U.S. economy and the effectiveness of the Biden administration's economic policies. As the country grapples with the prospect of a recession, the stakes for policymakers and the American people continue to rise.",claude
Pornhub offers quarantined Italians free access,"Pornhub Offers Quarantined Italians Free Access

In a surprising move amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the popular adult content platform Pornhub has announced that it will be offering free access to its premium services for all users in Italy. The decision comes as the country grapples with a nationwide lockdown, leaving millions of citizens confined to their homes.

Pornhub's vice president, Corey Price, explained the rationale behind the decision. ""With people stuck in their homes across Italy, we wanted to do our part in helping them get through this difficult time,"" he said. ""Pornhub is a place where people can find a much-needed escape, and we believe that this offer will help Italians deal with the boredom of quarantine.""

The free access will be available to all Italian users, regardless of whether they had previously subscribed to Pornhub's premium services. The offer will be valid for the entire duration of the lockdown, which is currently set to last until at least April 3rd.

Reaction to the announcement has been mixed, with some praising Pornhub's gesture as a much-needed morale boost, while others have raised concerns about the potential impact on public health.

""I think it's a really generous offer, especially for those of us who are struggling to keep ourselves entertained during the lockdown,"" said Maria Rossi, a 32-year-old resident of Milan. ""It's a welcome distraction from the constant news about the virus, and it might even help reduce stress levels.""

However, not everyone is convinced that Pornhub's offer is a positive development. Dr. Luca Bianchi, a prominent Italian psychologist, warned that the free access could have unintended consequences.

""While I understand the company's desire to help, I'm concerned that this offer could actually exacerbate the mental health challenges that many Italians are already facing,"" he said. ""Increased consumption of pornography can lead to addiction, which can in turn contribute to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety.""

Dr. Bianchi also raised concerns about the potential impact on children and adolescents, who may have increased access to adult content during the lockdown.

""Parents need to be vigilant in monitoring their children's online activities, as this offer could expose them to inappropriate and potentially harmful material,"" he said.

Despite these concerns, Pornhub has stood by its decision, arguing that the free access is a necessary and responsible response to the current crisis.

""We understand the concerns that have been raised, and we're taking steps to ensure that our platform remains safe and secure for all users,"" said Corey Price. ""We've implemented additional age verification checks, and we're working closely with relevant authorities to ensure that our content is accessed only by those who are of legal age.""

The company has also pledged to donate a portion of its profits from the Italian market to support COVID-19 relief efforts in the country.

As the lockdown in Italy continues, it remains to be seen how Pornhub's offer will be received by the public. Some experts believe that the free access could have a positive impact on morale and mental health, while others warn of the potential risks.

Regardless of the outcome, Pornhub's decision has certainly sparked a lively debate about the role of adult content in times of crisis, and the responsibility of technology companies to support their communities.",claude
What is a bear market?,"Here is a 680-word news article based on the title ""What is a bear market?"":

What is a Bear Market?
By [Your Name], Professional Journalist

The stock market has taken a significant downturn in recent months, with major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite falling by over 20% from their recent highs. This has led many to declare that we are now in a ""bear market"" - but what exactly does that mean?

A bear market is generally defined as a period where a market index, like the S&P 500, declines by 20% or more from its most recent high over a sustained period of time, typically two months or longer. The term ""bear"" is used to describe a market in which prices are falling and investor sentiment is predominantly negative.

In contrast, a ""bull market"" refers to a period when stock prices are rising and investor confidence is high. Bull markets are characterized by optimism, investor confidence, and expectations that strong results will continue.

What Causes a Bear Market?
There are a number of potential factors that can contribute to the development of a bear market:

Economic Recession: One of the most common triggers for a bear market is an economic recession. When the economy slows down, corporate profits tend to decline, and investors become more pessimistic about the future outlook. This can lead to a sustained sell-off in the stock market.

High Inflation and Interest Rates: Periods of high inflation, which erode consumer purchasing power, often prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an effort to cool down the economy. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive and can weigh on corporate profits and stock valuations.

Geopolitical Tensions: Major geopolitical events, such as wars, trade disputes, or political instability, can also spark a bear market as investors become more risk-averse and seek safer havens for their money.

Investor Sentiment: Even in the absence of clear economic or geopolitical catalysts, a bear market can emerge if investors collectively lose confidence in the market and begin selling off stocks en masse. This can become a self-fulfilling prophecy as the decline in prices further erodes sentiment.

How Long Do Bear Markets Last?
The duration of a bear market can vary significantly. Some bear markets are relatively short-lived, lasting just a few months, while others can persist for several years. On average, bear markets tend to last around 9-12 months, according to historical data.

The depth of the decline is also an important factor. While a 20% drop is the commonly accepted threshold for a bear market, some bear markets have seen declines of 30% or more before finally bottoming out.

Recovering from a Bear Market
Recovering from a bear market can be a slow and painful process. Investor confidence is often severely shaken, and it can take time for sentiment to improve and for stock prices to regain their previous highs.

However, history has shown that patient investors who stay the course are typically rewarded in the long run. Despite the periodic downturns, the stock market has generally trended upward over time, with the S&P 500 delivering an average annual return of around 10% since its inception.

Navigating a Bear Market
For individual investors, the key to navigating a bear market is to maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making hasty decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Diversifying your portfolio, rebalancing periodically, and continuing to invest regularly can help mitigate the impact of a bear market.

It's also important to remember that bear markets are a natural part of the market cycle. They provide opportunities for patient, disciplined investors to buy quality assets at discounted prices and position themselves for future gains when the market eventually recovers.",claude
US conducts airstrikes against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq,"US Conducts Airstrikes Against Multiple Iranian-Backed Militia Sites in Iraq

Washington, D.C. - In a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East, the United States military has carried out airstrikes against multiple sites belonging to Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq, according to senior U.S. officials.

The strikes, which occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning local time, targeted facilities used by Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful Shia militia group with close ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Pentagon confirmed that the airstrikes were a direct response to recent attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq.

""The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies,"" said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper in a statement. ""We will take whatever actions are necessary to protect our forces.""

The strikes, which were authorized by President Donald Trump, hit three separate locations along the Iraq-Syria border, destroying ammunition depots and weapon storage facilities. According to U.S. officials, the targets were selected based on their involvement in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base near Kirkuk on Friday, which killed two U.S. service members and one British soldier.

""These strikes were defensive, proportional, and in direct response to the threat posed by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups who continue to attack bases hosting Coalition forces,"" Esper added.

The airstrikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing tensions between the United States and Iran, which have been simmering since the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and the subsequent reimposition of harsh economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

In recent months, there has been a series of tit-for-tat attacks between U.S. forces and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, including the U.S. drone strike that killed powerful Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. The latest strikes are likely to further inflame tensions and raise the risk of a broader conflict in the region.

Kataib Hezbollah, the primary target of the airstrikes, is one of the most powerful and well-equipped of the Iranian-backed militias operating in Iraq. The group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, has been responsible for numerous attacks on U.S. and coalition forces over the years, including the recent rocket attack that prompted the latest airstrikes.

In response to the U.S. action, the Iraqi government condemned the strikes as a ""violation of Iraqi sovereignty"" and called for an emergency session of the Iraqi parliament to discuss the matter. The Iranian government also condemned the airstrikes, with a spokesperson for the IRGC warning that Iran would take ""decisive revenge"" for the attack.

The escalating tensions come at a critical time for the region, as the COVID-19 pandemic has added to the economic and political instability in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East. The U.S. airstrikes also come just days before the one-year anniversary of the killing of Soleimani, which sparked a major crisis between the U.S. and Iran.

As the situation continues to unfold, analysts warn that the risk of a wider conflict in the region remains high, and that both the U.S. and Iran will need to exercise caution to avoid further escalation.

""This is a dangerous moment, and both sides will need to show restraint and diplomacy to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control,"" said Middle East expert Dr. Nadia Oweidat. ""The stakes are high, and the potential for miscalculation is significant.""",claude

From the opening moments of ""Onward,"" it's clear that this is no lighthearted romp. The film's prologue sets the stage, introducing the world of the Lightfoot family and the tragic loss they've endured. As Ian, the younger and more reserved of the two brothers, prepares to celebrate his 16th birthday, the absence of their father is palpably felt.

Director Dan Scanlon, who based the film on his own experiences of growing up without a father, masterfully weaves the emotional thread throughout the narrative. The brothers' journey to reconnect with their dad is filled with both humor and heartbreak, as they navigate the complexities of their relationship and the weight of their loss.

One of the film's standout moments comes early on, as Ian attempts to use a magical spell to bring their father back for a single day. The sequence, which features the brothers' desperate attempts to complete the ritual, is a gut-punch of emotion, perfectly capturing the bittersweet longing that drives their quest.

""Onward"" is not the first Pixar film to tackle heavy themes of loss and grief. The studio has a well-established reputation for crafting stories that tug at the heartstrings, from the opening montage of ""Up"" to the poignant finale of ""Toy Story 3."" However, ""Onward"" manages to stand out, offering a fresh perspective on the grieving process and the importance of family.

One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to balance the emotional weight with moments of levity and humor. The dynamic between Ian and Barley, who represent the different ways people cope with loss, provides ample opportunity for both laugh-out-loud moments and heartfelt exchanges.

The film's fantasy setting, which blends traditional fairy tale elements with a modern, suburban landscape, also serves to enhance the emotional impact. The juxtaposition of the magical and the mundane creates a sense of wonder and nostalgia, reminding us of the power of imagination to heal and connect.

Ultimately, ""Onward"" is a testament to Pixar's unwavering commitment to crafting stories that resonate on a deeply personal level. The film's exploration of grief, family, and the enduring love that transcends death is sure to leave a lasting impression on audiences.

As the credits roll, it's likely that many viewers will find themselves reaching for the tissues once again, a testament to Pixar's ability to tap into the universal human experiences that unite us all. ""Onward"" may be the latest in a long line of tear-jerking Pixar films, but it's a testament to the studio's enduring ability to create stories that leave a lasting impact on the heart.",claude
Wakayama rafting: It's on logs -- and standing up!,"Wakayama Rafting: It's on Logs -- and Standing Up!

Wakayama, Japan - Thrill-seekers in Japan have found a new and exhilarating way to experience the great outdoors, and it's not your typical rafting adventure. In the picturesque Wakayama prefecture, adventurers are flocking to a unique river experience that combines the adrenaline of whitewater rafting with the challenge of standing on floating logs.

The Kino River, nestled in the heart of Wakayama, has become the epicenter of this unconventional water sport, known as ""taru-bune"" or ""barrel rafting."" Unlike traditional rafting, where participants sit or kneel in a sturdy inflatable raft, taru-bune enthusiasts must maintain their balance while standing on interconnected wooden barrels or logs as they navigate the rushing currents.

""It's an entirely different experience from regular rafting,"" says Takeshi Yamamoto, a local tour guide who has been leading taru-bune excursions for the past decade. ""The added challenge of standing up and keeping your balance while the logs are bobbing and weaving through the rapids really takes the thrill to a whole new level.""

The taru-bune experience begins with a safety briefing and a lesson in proper standing and balance techniques. Participants are outfitted with life jackets, helmets, and specialized footwear designed to provide traction on the slippery logs. Once the group is ready, they carefully step onto the interconnected barrels or logs and push off into the river.

""It's a delicate dance, trying to maintain your balance as the logs twist and turn through the rapids,"" explains Yuki Tanaka, a first-time taru-bune participant. ""One moment you're gliding smoothly, and the next, you're bracing yourself against the current, trying not to take a dip in the river.""

The Kino River's diverse terrain offers a range of challenges for taru-bune enthusiasts. Gentle sections allow for moments of respite and the opportunity to admire the picturistic landscapes, while more turbulent areas test the participants' agility and coordination.

""The best part is the sense of accomplishment you feel when you navigate through the tougher rapids without falling off,"" says Tanaka. ""It's a real test of your physical and mental strength.""

The taru-bune experience has not only captured the attention of thrill-seekers but also the interest of local authorities and tourism organizations. Recognizing the potential to attract visitors to the region, the Wakayama government has invested in infrastructure and safety measures to support the growing popularity of this unique water sport.

""We're seeing a surge of interest, both from domestic and international tourists,"" says Hiroshi Nakamura, a representative from the Wakayama Tourism Bureau. ""Taru-bune offers a truly one-of-a-kind adventure that showcases the natural beauty and adventurous spirit of our region.""

As the summer season approaches, the Kino River is expected to draw even more adventurers seeking to test their balance and embrace the exhilaration of taru-bune. For those looking to experience the unconventional thrill of standing on logs while navigating whitewater rapids, Wakayama's taru-bune promises an unforgettable and adrenaline-fueled adventure.",claude
Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"Guinea-Bissau: Political Chaos Could Boost Cocaine Trade

BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau – The small West African nation of Guinea-Bissau has long been plagued by political instability, with a history of coups, military interventions, and power struggles. Now, experts warn that the latest bout of turmoil could pave the way for a resurgence of the country's illicit drug trade, potentially transforming the nation into a major hub for the trafficking of cocaine.

The trigger for the current crisis was the dismissal of Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam by President Umaro Sissoco Embaló in late May. Nabiam's removal, which was condemned by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as a violation of the country's constitution, has led to a deepening political impasse, with rival factions vying for control of the government.

""This is a very dangerous situation,"" said Joana Pereira, a political analyst at the Bissau-based Institute for Security Studies. ""When you have this level of political chaos, it creates the perfect conditions for criminal networks to thrive and expand their operations.""

Guinea-Bissau's strategic location, with its long coastline and porous borders, has long made it an attractive transit point for drug traffickers moving cocaine from Latin America to Europe. In the past, the country's political instability and weak institutions have allowed these criminal networks to establish a firm foothold, with some even infiltrating the highest levels of government.

""The political crisis we're seeing now could significantly exacerbate this problem,"" warned Pereira. ""Without a stable government and effective law enforcement, the drug traffickers will have free rein to operate with impunity.""

The concerns are echoed by international organizations, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which has warned that the political turmoil in Guinea-Bissau could undermine efforts to combat the drug trade.

""We've seen this pattern before, where periods of political instability have allowed the drug trade to thrive,"" said UNODC representative Anita Kaya. ""It's a vicious cycle that can be extremely difficult to break.""

The potential resurgence of the drug trade in Guinea-Bissau is not just a domestic concern, but one that has broader regional and global implications. The country's strategic location could make it a hub for the movement of cocaine throughout West Africa and beyond, potentially fueling conflicts, corruption, and instability in neighboring countries.

""This is a problem that affects us all,"" said Kaya. ""The international community needs to act quickly and decisively to support Guinea-Bissau in addressing this crisis and strengthening its institutions to combat the drug trade.""

One potential solution, according to experts, is for ECOWAS and other regional bodies to take a more active role in mediating the political conflict and ensuring the restoration of constitutional order. Additionally, increased international assistance and capacity-building efforts could help strengthen Guinea-Bissau's law enforcement and judicial systems, making it more difficult for drug traffickers to operate.

""Time is of the essence,"" warned Pereira. ""If we don't act now, the consequences could be dire, not just for Guinea-Bissau, but for the entire region and beyond.""

As the political crisis in Guinea-Bissau continues to unfold, the threat of a resurgent drug trade looms large. The international community must work together to support the country in addressing this challenge and restoring stability, before the consequences become too dire to ignore.",claude
Schools knew of trouble before student deaths,"Schools Knew of Trouble Before Student Deaths

In a tragic turn of events, a growing body of evidence suggests that several schools were aware of potential threats and warning signs before the recent spate of student deaths that have shaken the community.

The investigation reveals that administrators at multiple institutions had been notified of concerning behavior and red flags among students, yet failed to take adequate preventive measures. This raises disturbing questions about the level of responsibility and accountability within the education system.

One particularly harrowing case involves the death of 16-year-old Emily Wilkins, a straight-A student who took her own life last month. According to her parents, the school had been informed on multiple occasions about Emily's struggles with depression and bullying, but did not provide the necessary support or intervention.

""We pleaded with the principal and counselors to help Emily,"" said her mother, Sarah Wilkins. ""They brushed it off, saying it was just 'teenage drama.' If they had taken it seriously and got her the help she needed, our daughter might still be alive today.""

School records obtained by our news team corroborate the Wilkins' account, showing that Emily's teachers had filed several incident reports regarding her deteriorating mental health and interactions with bullies. However, these warnings apparently fell on deaf ears, with no meaningful action taken to address the situation.

Similarly, the family of 14-year-old Jacob Nguyen, who died in a car accident last week, claim that the school was aware of his struggles with anxiety and depression. Jacob's parents assert that they had repeatedly requested additional support and resources for their son, only to be met with empty promises and inaction.

""They kept telling us they would look into it, but nothing ever changed,"" said Jacob's father, David Nguyen. ""If the school had connected Jacob with a counselor or therapist, maybe he would still be here. We hold them responsible for not doing more to protect our child.""

Tragically, these cases are not isolated incidents. Our investigation has uncovered similar patterns at other schools in the area, where administrators were informed of troubling student behavior or mental health issues, yet failed to take meaningful steps to address the problems.

One former teacher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, expressed deep frustration with the lack of prioritization around student wellbeing.

""It's all about test scores and funding these days,"" the teacher said. ""The schools are so focused on maintaining their reputations and appearances that they often turn a blind eye to the real issues students are facing. Mental health support and intervention programs are woefully underfunded or nonexistent.""

The revelations have sparked outrage within the community, with many parents and advocates calling for immediate reforms and accountability.

""These are our children's lives we're talking about,"" said local PTA president, Samantha Hernandez. ""The schools have a moral and ethical obligation to protect and support their students, especially the most vulnerable ones. Their failure to do so is unacceptable and heartbreaking.""

In response to the growing public outcry, the school district has promised a comprehensive review of its policies and procedures regarding student mental health and safety. However, many remain skeptical about the sincerity of these efforts, given the long-standing issues that have seemingly been ignored.

As the community grapples with the devastating loss of young lives, the question of what could have been done to prevent these tragedies looms large. The revelations have shaken the foundation of trust between families and their local schools, leaving many to wonder how such breakdowns in communication and care could have occurred.

Moving forward, there is a clear and urgent need for systemic change within the education system – one that prioritizes the wellbeing of students above all else and holds administrators accountable for their actions, or lack thereof. Only then can the community begin to heal and ensure that no other families have to endure the unimaginable pain of losing a child due to preventable circumstances.",claude
A bipartisan Buttigieg effect? The people of this gorgeous island country say yes,"""A bipartisan Buttigieg effect? The people of this gorgeous island country say yes""

REYKJAVIK, Iceland - In a surprising turn of events, the people of Iceland have been reporting a noticeable ""Buttigieg effect"" sweeping across the Nordic nation, with citizens from all political persuasions expressing a newfound admiration for the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg.

The phenomenon first came to light when a group of Icelandic residents, ranging from staunch conservatives to ardent progressives, gathered at a local coffee shop in the heart of Reykjavik to discuss their shared fascination with the rising political star.

""It's quite remarkable,"" said Sigurdur Magnusson, a self-proclaimed right-wing businessman. ""I never thought I'd find myself agreeing with a Democrat, let alone an American one. But there's just something about Buttigieg that resonates with me and many others here.""

Magnusson went on to praise Buttigieg's pragmatic approach to problem-solving, his eloquence, and his ability to bridge the partisan divide. ""He seems to have this unique talent for finding common ground and bringing people together, even in the most polarized political climate. That's something we could really use more of, both here in Iceland and around the world.""

Across the table, Katrin Thorvaldsdottir, a left-leaning environmental activist, nodded in agreement. ""I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first. But the more I've learned about Buttigieg and his policies, the more impressed I've become. He's not afraid to tackle the tough issues, like infrastructure and climate change, in a way that transcends party lines.""

Thorvaldsdottir highlighted Buttigieg's emphasis on sustainable transportation and his commitment to addressing the challenges of the 21st century. ""It's refreshing to see a politician who isn't just talking the talk, but actually walking the walk when it comes to creating a more resilient and equitable future.""

The ""Buttigieg effect"" has even extended beyond the capital city, with reports of similar sentiments echoing across the rugged Icelandic landscape. In the picturesque fishing village of Ísafjörður, local resident Gunnar Einarsson, a self-described independent voter, shared his perspective.

""I've always been someone who tries to look at the bigger picture, rather than getting caught up in partisan squabbles. And when I see someone like Buttigieg, who seems to have that same approach, it really resonates with me and a lot of my neighbors,"" Einarsson said.

He went on to highlight Buttigieg's emphasis on infrastructure, a topic of particular importance to Icelanders, who have long grappled with the challenges of maintaining roads, bridges, and other vital transportation networks in the face of harsh weather and a geographically dispersed population.

""Buttigieg understands that good infrastructure isn't just about politics; it's about connecting communities, fostering economic growth, and improving the quality of life for everyone,"" Einarsson said. ""That's the kind of pragmatic, solutions-oriented leadership we need, regardless of party affiliation.""

The ""Buttigieg effect"" has even sparked a growing interest in U.S. politics among Icelanders, with many expressing a newfound curiosity about the American political landscape and the potential for bipartisan cooperation.

""It's been really fascinating to see how Buttigieg has been able to capture the attention and admiration of people across the political spectrum, both here in Iceland and, I imagine, back in the States,"" said Thorvaldsdottir. ""It's a testament to the power of good ideas and effective leadership, regardless of one's political leanings.""

As the conversation at the Reykjavik coffee shop wound down, the group of Icelanders shared a sense of optimism and a renewed belief in the possibility of bridging the partisan divide. ""If a small island nation like ours can find common ground with an American politician, just imagine what could be possible on a larger scale,"" Magnusson mused. ""The 'Buttigieg effect' may be just the beginning of a new era of bipartisanship and cooperation.""",claude
Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights,"""Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights""

In a bold and unprecedented move, Nikki Haley, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, has announced the launch of a new initiative aimed at addressing human rights violations on a global scale. The initiative, titled ""The Haley Institute for Human Rights,"" will serve as a non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to investigating, documenting, and raising awareness about human rights abuses around the world.

Haley, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to the UN from 2017 to 2019, has long been a vocal advocate for human rights and has frequently criticized the United Nations for its perceived inaction on critical issues. In a statement released earlier today, Haley expressed her frustration with the lack of tangible progress in addressing human rights violations, stating, ""The time for empty rhetoric and political posturing has passed. We need to take concrete action to protect the most vulnerable and hold those responsible for atrocities accountable.""

The Haley Institute for Human Rights will operate independently from the U.S. government, allowing it to take a more aggressive and uncompromising stance on human rights issues. The institute will focus on conducting in-depth investigations, gathering evidence, and publishing detailed reports on a wide range of human rights violations, including genocide, torture, arbitrary detention, and the suppression of free speech and assembly.

""We will not shy away from the tough cases, the ones that the international community has been reluctant to confront,"" Haley said during the institute's launch event. ""Our mission is to shine a light on the darkest corners of the world and to ensure that those responsible for these heinous acts are held accountable.""

The institute will also work closely with local and international human rights organizations, as well as with governments and international bodies, to advocate for policy changes and the implementation of effective mechanisms to prevent and respond to human rights abuses.

One of the institute's first initiatives will be a comprehensive investigation into the ongoing human rights crisis in Myanmar, where the military junta has been accused of committing atrocities against the Rohingya minority and other ethnic groups. The institute plans to deploy a team of experienced researchers and investigators to the region to gather first-hand accounts and documentation of the alleged abuses.

""The situation in Myanmar is a prime example of the kind of human rights crisis that the international community has failed to adequately address,"" Haley said. ""We intend to change that by providing the world with a clear and unbiased understanding of what is happening on the ground and by pressing for concrete action to protect the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable.""

The Haley Institute for Human Rights has already attracted significant support from both private and public donors, including several high-profile philanthropists and human rights advocates. The institute's board of directors includes a diverse group of experts and activists from around the world, ensuring a global perspective on the issues it will address.

As Haley embarks on this new chapter of her career, many observers are hailing her decision to launch the institute as a bold and necessary step in the fight for global human rights. Some have even speculated that this could be the first step towards a potential political comeback for the former ambassador, who has been widely rumored to be considering a run for the presidency in 2024.

Regardless of her political ambitions, Haley's commitment to human rights is undeniable, and the Haley Institute for Human Rights promises to be a powerful and influential force in the global struggle for justice and accountability.",claude
Christmas Island: 'A giant robber crab stole my camera',"""A Giant Robber Crab Stole My Camera on Christmas Island""

Christmas Island, Indian Ocean - It was supposed to be a routine photography expedition for nature enthusiast and amateur photographer, Sarah Denson, but what unfolded on the remote Australian territory of Christmas Island was anything but ordinary.

""I had heard stories about the famous robber crabs on Christmas Island, but I never imagined one would have the audacity to steal my camera,"" recounts Denson, still visibly shaken by the encounter.

Denson, 42, had traveled to Christmas Island, located in the Indian Ocean approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km) northwest of the western Australian city of Perth, with the hopes of capturing stunning images of the island's unique wildlife. Little did she know, she would become the subject of one of the island's most notorious creatures.

The robber crab, also known as the coconut crab, is the largest land-living arthropod in the world, with some specimens reaching over 3 feet (1 meter) in length and weighing up to 9 pounds (4 kg). These massive crustaceans are known for their powerful pincers and their curious nature, often stealing shiny objects from unsuspecting humans.

""I was hiking along one of the trails, carefully watching my step to avoid disturbing the crabs that littered the path, when suddenly this massive crab emerged from the underbrush and made a beeline straight for me,"" Denson recounts.

Denson instinctively raised her camera to capture the encounter, but before she could even press the shutter, the crab had swiftly seized the camera in its powerful claws and scuttled away into the dense foliage.

""I was in complete shock. I just stood there, mouth agape, watching this crab casually stroll away with my $3,000 camera,"" Denson said. ""I couldn't believe what had just happened.""

Denson immediately alerted the park rangers, who launched a search operation to try and locate the wayward crab and retrieve the stolen camera. After hours of scouring the island's rugged terrain, the rangers finally spotted the crab perched atop a rocky outcrop, Denson's camera firmly in its grasp.

""When we approached the crab, it immediately went into a defensive posture, raising its claws and hissing at us,"" said Ranger Emily Watkins. ""We knew we had to be extremely cautious, as these crabs can inflict some serious damage with those powerful pincers.""

Using a long pole, the rangers were able to gently pry the camera from the crab's clutches, much to Denson's relief. However, the camera was found to be irreparably damaged, the lens crushed by the crab's mighty grip.

""I'm just grateful they were able to get my camera back, even if it's beyond repair,"" Denson said. ""I can't help but wonder what the crab was planning to do with it. Maybe it was going to take some selfies?""

The incident has shed light on the remarkable intelligence and behavior of these giant crustaceans, which are known to use tools, exhibit complex social interactions, and even display a curious fascination with shiny objects.

""Robber crabs are truly remarkable creatures,"" said Dr. Olivia Hawthorn, a marine biologist specializing in Christmas Island's unique ecosystem. ""Their ability to recognize and interact with objects in their environment, including stealing cameras, is a testament to their cognitive abilities. This incident just goes to show that we still have a lot to learn about these enigmatic animals.""

As for Denson, she's not letting the crab encounter dampen her enthusiasm for exploring Christmas Island's natural wonders. She's already planning a return trip, this time armed with a more secure camera and a healthy respect for the island's notorious robber crabs.

""I may have lost my camera, but I gained an incredible story and a newfound appreciation for the incredible wildlife of Christmas Island,"" Denson said. ""Who knows, maybe next time I'll be able to outsmart the crabs and get the perfect shot.""",claude
Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change,"""Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change""

Renowned artist Olafur Eliasson believes that art can play a vital role in addressing the pressing issue of climate change. In a recent interview, the Danish-Icelandic artist discussed how his work aims to inspire environmental awareness and spur action among the public.

Eliasson, known for his large-scale immersive installations that explore the relationship between nature, technology, and human perception, has long been committed to using his art to tackle global challenges. His latest project, ""Ice Watch,"" is a powerful example of this approach.

""Ice Watch"" involves the display of large blocks of glacial ice, harvested from the waters off Greenland, in public spaces around the world. The installation serves as a tangible and visceral representation of the melting of the polar ice caps, a direct consequence of climate change.

""When people encounter the ice blocks, they can actually see, hear, and feel the effects of global warming,"" Eliasson explains. ""It's a way to make the abstract concept of climate change more immediate and personal for the viewer.""

The artist believes that art has the unique ability to convey complex scientific and environmental issues in a way that resonates emotionally with the public. ""Art can create a sense of empathy and connection that goes beyond the purely rational,"" he says. ""It can inspire people to care about the planet in a way that dry scientific data simply cannot.""

Eliasson's work often incorporates elements of nature, such as water, light, and weather, to heighten the viewer's awareness of their own relationship with the environment. In his 2003 installation ""The Weather Project,"" for example, he created a giant sun-like orb that filled the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, prompting visitors to reflect on their place within the natural world.

""My goal is to create experiences that make people pause and really consider their impact on the environment,"" Eliasson explains. ""I want them to feel a sense of wonder and connection, but also a responsibility to protect the planet.""

Beyond his own artistic practice, Eliasson has also been actively involved in using art to drive social and political change. In 2014, he co-founded the non-profit organization Little Sun, which distributes affordable solar-powered lamps to communities in off-grid regions of Africa, providing access to sustainable energy and lighting.

""Art has the power to transcend boundaries and bring people together around common causes,"" Eliasson says. ""By using art to raise awareness and inspire action on climate change, we can tap into the collective creativity and empathy of people around the world.""

As the world grapples with the escalating effects of climate change, Eliasson's work serves as a powerful reminder of the vital role that art can play in shaping our understanding and response to this global crisis. Through his immersive installations and collaborative initiatives, the artist continues to push the boundaries of what art can achieve in the fight for a more sustainable future.",claude
Opinion | ItÃ¢ÂÂs a MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"""Opinion | It's a MAGA Microbe Meltdown""

In a stunning turn of events, the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement has found itself embroiled in a peculiar controversy, as a group of fervent supporters have taken their devotion to the extreme by ingesting a novel strain of bacteria they believe will grant them enhanced abilities.

The story began to unfold when reports surfaced of a growing number of individuals claiming to have gained superhuman strength, heightened senses, and even the ability to communicate with inanimate objects after consuming a mysterious ""MAGA microbe"" they discovered online. These self-proclaimed ""MAGA Mutants"" have been posting videos and testimonials on various social media platforms, touting the purported benefits of their unconventional dietary supplement.

""I can now lift twice my bodyweight and see in the dark,"" boasted one individual, who identified themselves only as ""Patriot Petey."" ""And just yesterday, I had a full conversation with my toaster. It told me that Trump is the rightful president, and we need to take back our country from the deep state.""

However, the excitement surrounding the MAGA microbe has quickly turned to alarm as the true nature of the substance has come to light. According to medical experts, the ""microbe"" is, in fact, a highly dangerous strain of bacteria that can cause severe gastrointestinal issues, neurological problems, and in some cases, even death.

""This is not something to be taken lightly,"" warned Dr. Amelia Sinclair, a prominent infectious disease specialist. ""The individuals who have consumed this substance are putting their lives at serious risk. The effects can be unpredictable and potentially devastating.""

Despite the dire warnings, the MAGA Mutants remain undeterred, insisting that the microbe is a ""gift from God"" and a crucial tool in the fight against the ""globalist elites"" and the ""deep state.""

""They can try to silence us, but we won't back down,"" declared one self-proclaimed MAGA Mutant in a video that has since gone viral. ""This microbe is the key to unlocking our true potential and taking back our country. We're not going to let the mainstream media or the liberal establishment stop us.""

The situation has become so concerning that several social media platforms have taken action to remove the MAGA microbe-related content, citing the potential for harm. However, the MAGA Mutants have responded by creating their own alternative platforms, where they continue to spread their message and encourage others to join their cause.

""This is just the beginning,"" warned another MAGA Mutant. ""We're only going to get stronger, and we're not going to stop until we've taken back what's rightfully ours.""

As the MAGA microbe phenomenon continues to unfold, public health officials and law enforcement agencies are scrambling to contain the situation and prevent further harm. They are urging the public to avoid consuming any unauthorized substances and to seek immediate medical attention if they have already done so.

""This is a dangerous and delusional movement that poses a serious threat to public health and safety,"" said one anonymous government official. ""We are doing everything in our power to shut it down and protect the American people from these misguided individuals.""

Only time will tell how this bizarre and unsettling saga will unfold, but one thing is certain: the MAGA Mutants are not backing down, and the battle for the soul of the nation has taken an unexpected and disturbing turn.",claude
Bernie Sanders plans to stay in the 2020 presidential race,"Here is a 600-word news article based on the title ""Bernie Sanders plans to stay in the 2020 presidential race"":

Bernie Sanders Plans to Stay in the 2020 Presidential Race

By [Your Name], [News Outlet] Journalist

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Senator Bernie Sanders announced today that he plans to remain in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race, despite growing calls for him to drop out and support the presumptive nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I will continue to fight for the working people of this country who are struggling to make ends meet,"" Sanders told reporters at a press conference in the nation's capital. ""Now is not the time to let up in our fight for Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, bold action on climate change, and getting money out of politics.""

Sanders' decision comes as Biden has amassed a nearly insurmountable delegate lead after a string of primary victories, including decisive wins in Michigan, Florida, and Illinois. With the coronavirus pandemic disrupting the primary calendar and forcing the cancellation of several upcoming contests, the path to the nomination has become increasingly difficult for the Vermont senator.

However, Sanders argued that he still has a ""narrow path"" to the nomination, pointing to upcoming primaries in large, delegate-rich states like New York and Pennsylvania. He also noted that he has won several key battleground states that will be crucial in the general election, including California, Colorado, and Nevada.

""The American people deserve a real debate about the future of our country, not a coronation,"" Sanders said. ""Vice President Biden has not yet sealed the deal, and my supporters deserve to have their voices heard.""

The Sanders campaign has also indicated that it plans to leverage its large grassroots base to influence the Democratic party's platform and policy positions, even if the senator ultimately falls short of the nomination. Sanders' team has said it will push for the inclusion of progressive priorities like Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and free public college tuition.

Biden, for his part, has struck a conciliatory tone towards Sanders and his supporters, acknowledging the senator's significant contributions to the party's policy discussions. The former vice president has also made overtures to incorporate some of Sanders' signature issues into his own policy platform.

""I know Bernie and I have our differences, but I respect his passion and the movement he has built,"" Biden said in a statement. ""My door is always open, and I look forward to working with him to defeat Donald Trump and unite the country.""

However, some Democratic leaders have expressed concerns that a prolonged primary battle could sap energy and resources from the party's efforts to unseat the incumbent president. There are also fears that lingering tensions between the moderate and progressive wings of the party could hamper efforts to rally the base in the general election.

""We need to come together as a party and focus on the real task at hand - defeating Donald Trump,"" said Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez. ""The American people are counting on us, and we can't afford to be divided.""

Sanders has vowed to stay in the race and make his case to voters in the remaining primaries. But with time running short and the delegate math increasingly daunting, the senator's path to the nomination appears to be narrowing. Nonetheless, he has pledged to continue fighting for the progressive vision that has animated his political movement.

""The struggle continues,"" Sanders said. ""Together, we will transform this country and create a government that works for all, not just the wealthy and well-connected.""",claude
Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus,"Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus

Washington, D.C. - As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the United States, concerns are growing over the lack of testing for President Donald Trump, who has not been screened for the virus despite potential exposure.

Trump's refusal to be tested has raised alarm among public health experts, who warn that his decision sets a dangerous precedent and undermines efforts to contain the outbreak.

""The president of the United States should be leading by example when it comes to public health measures,"" said Dr. Emily Landon, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago Medicine. ""By refusing to get tested, he is sending the wrong message to the American people and jeopardizing the effectiveness of our response to this crisis.""

Trump's potential exposure to the virus came during a recent trip to Mar-a-Lago, where several individuals who attended events there have since tested positive for COVID-19. Despite this, the president has repeatedly stated that he does not believe he needs to be tested, citing the fact that he has not exhibited any symptoms.

However, public health experts argue that this stance is misguided and potentially reckless. They note that the virus can be transmitted by individuals who are asymptomatic, meaning they show no outward signs of infection.

""Just because the president isn't feeling sick doesn't mean he couldn't be carrying the virus and spreading it to others,"" said Dr. Landon. ""That's why it's so important for everyone, regardless of their symptoms, to get tested and self-isolate if necessary.""

The president's refusal to be tested has also raised concerns about the potential impact on the broader public health response. By setting an example of dismissing the importance of testing, Trump may be undermining efforts to encourage widespread testing and social distancing measures.

""The president's actions send a message that testing isn't important, and that's simply not true,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. ""If we want to get this pandemic under control, we need everyone, including the president, to take testing and other preventive measures seriously.""

Furthermore, the lack of testing for Trump has raised questions about the potential for a conflict of interest, as the president's personal health status could have significant implications for the country's leadership and the government's response to the crisis.

""The American people deserve to know that their president is healthy and able to lead during this challenging time,"" said Dr. Landon. ""Refusing to get tested raises concerns about transparency and accountability, which are essential for maintaining public trust.""

Despite these concerns, the White House has continued to defend the president's decision, arguing that he is following the advice of his medical team and that testing should be reserved for those who are exhibiting symptoms or have been in close contact with confirmed cases.

However, public health experts counter that this stance is shortsighted and fails to recognize the importance of widespread testing in containing the spread of the virus.

""We need to be testing as many people as possible, including those who may be asymptomatic,"" said Dr. Jha. ""That's the only way we're going to get a handle on this outbreak and protect the most vulnerable members of our society.""

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold, the president's refusal to be tested has become a growing source of concern and controversy. Public health experts warn that this decision could have far-reaching consequences, both for the president's own health and the broader public health response.

""The stakes are simply too high for the president to be taking this kind of stance,"" said Dr. Landon. ""We need leadership and accountability from our elected officials, and that starts with leading by example when it comes to public health measures.""",claude
How to Use an Instant Pot,"Here is a 600-word news article on the topic ""How to Use an Instant Pot"":

How to Use an Instant Pot
By [Your Name], Journalist

The Instant Pot has become a kitchen staple for home cooks looking to make delicious meals with minimal effort. This versatile appliance can pressure cook, slow cook, sauté, steam, and more, making it a one-stop shop for a variety of recipes. If you're new to using an Instant Pot, the process may seem a bit daunting at first. But with a few simple tips, you'll be pressure cooking like a pro in no time.

Understand the Parts
Before you get started, it's important to familiarize yourself with the different components of the Instant Pot. The main body houses the inner pot, where you'll place your ingredients. The lid locks into place and contains the pressure valve, which controls the release of steam. There's also a control panel with various buttons for selecting cooking programs and adjusting time and temperature.

Master the Basics
The key to using an Instant Pot successfully is learning the basic pressure cooking process. Start by adding your ingredients to the inner pot, making sure not to fill it more than two-thirds full to allow for proper pressurization. Secure the lid and turn the steam release valve to the sealing position. Then, select the appropriate cooking program and time. Most Instant Pot models have pre-programmed settings for common dishes like soup, meat, rice, and more.

Once the cooking time is up, you have two options for releasing the pressure: natural release or quick release. Natural release allows the pressure to gradually come down on its own, which can take 10-20 minutes. Quick release manually forces the steam out, which is faster but can cause hot liquid to spurt out. For safety, always use a kitchen towel or oven mitt when turning the steam release valve to the venting position.

Explore Different Functions
While pressure cooking is the Instant Pot's main claim to fame, the appliance is capable of so much more. Take advantage of the sauté function to brown meats or sauté vegetables before pressure cooking. The slow cook setting allows you to make hands-off meals like chili or pot roast. You can also use the Instant Pot to steam delicate foods like fish, vegetables, and dumplings.

For best results, consult the manufacturer's instructions or an Instant Pot cookbook to learn the optimal settings and cook times for different recipes and ingredients. Experimentation is key, as cooking times may vary depending on the size and thickness of your food.

Master Meal Prep
One of the biggest benefits of the Instant Pot is its ability to speed up meal prep. You can use it to cook proteins, grains, and vegetables in advance, then incorporate them into quick and easy meals throughout the week. For example, you can pressure cook a whole chicken, shred the meat, and use it for tacos, salads, or soups. Or cook a big batch of brown rice or quinoa to have on hand for side dishes.

The Instant Pot also excels at making large quantities of soup, chili, and stew, which freeze beautifully for future meals. Simply portion out the leftovers and store them in the freezer for a quick and healthy homemade option.

With a little practice, the Instant Pot can become an invaluable tool in your kitchen arsenal. Its versatility and time-saving capabilities make it a game-changer for busy home cooks. So dust off that Instant Pot and get ready to enjoy delicious, hassle-free meals.",claude
Delhi riots: 'No-one who saw the photo thought I would survive',"Delhi riots: 'No-one who saw the photo thought I would survive'

In the aftermath of the devastating riots that erupted in Delhi's Jafrabad neighborhood, a harrowing story has emerged of one man's miraculous survival against all odds. Faizan, a 23-year-old resident of the area, recounts the horrific events that unfolded on the fateful day of February 24th, 2020.

""I still remember that day vividly,"" Faizan says, his voice trembling with emotion. ""The violence had been building up for days, and on that day, it reached a fever pitch. The streets were filled with mobs, and the sound of shattering glass and angry chants was deafening.""

Faizan, who was on his way to a nearby mosque, found himself caught in the middle of the chaos. ""I was just trying to get to the mosque to pray, but the streets were impassable. Suddenly, I was surrounded by a group of men wielding sticks and metal rods. They started beating me mercilessly.""

As the mob descended upon him, Faizan's instinct was to protect his head, and he curled up on the ground, bracing for the worst. ""I thought I was going to die. The blows just kept coming, and I could feel the pain searing through my body.""

Amidst the pandemonium, a bystander managed to capture a harrowing image of Faizan lying motionless on the ground, his face covered in blood. The photograph, which quickly went viral on social media, became a symbol of the brutality and senselessness of the riots.

""When I saw that photo, I couldn't believe it was me,"" Faizan recounts. ""No one who saw it thought I would survive. But somehow, I did.""

Faizan's miraculous survival is a testament to the sheer strength of the human spirit and the power of resilience. After being rushed to the hospital, he underwent extensive treatment for his injuries, which included multiple fractures and severe internal bleeding.

""The doctors told me that I was lucky to be alive. They said that the injuries I sustained were usually fatal, but somehow, I managed to pull through,"" Faizan says.

As he recovered, Faizan grappled with the emotional and psychological scars left by the ordeal. ""I was in shock for a long time. Every time I closed my eyes, I could see the faces of the men who attacked me. I couldn't sleep, and I was constantly on edge.""

But Faizan's determination to overcome his trauma and seek justice for what had happened to him was unwavering. He filed a police complaint and worked tirelessly to ensure that the perpetrators were held accountable.

""I knew that I had to fight for myself and for all the other victims of the riots. It wasn't just about me – it was about standing up for our rights and our dignity as human beings,"" Faizan says.

Despite the immense challenges he faced, Faizan's story has become a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. His courage and perseverance have inspired many, and his story has become a rallying cry for those seeking justice and accountability in the aftermath of the Delhi riots.

""I'm still healing, both physically and emotionally,"" Faizan admits. ""But I won't let this experience break me. I'm determined to use my voice to ensure that no one else has to go through what I did. This is a fight for our future, and I'm not going to back down.""

As the Delhi riots continue to be a subject of intense scrutiny and debate, Faizan's story serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of such violence. His resilience and determination in the face of unimaginable adversity stand as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the human soul.",claude
What this will cost Mitch McConnell,"Here is a 660-word news article based on the title ""What this will cost Mitch McConnell"":

What this will cost Mitch McConnell

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing growing pressure and potential consequences within his own party after his recent comments on the debt ceiling negotiations.

McConnell has been a central figure in the ongoing standoff between Democrats and Republicans over raising the federal debt limit. For weeks, he has refused to allow Republicans to vote with Democrats to increase the borrowing authority, insisting that Democrats use the arduous budget reconciliation process instead.

However, McConnell's tactics appear to have backfired, as he now finds himself at odds with members of his own caucus who are growing increasingly frustrated with his hardline approach.

Several Republican senators have publicly broken with McConnell, criticizing his strategy and calling for a more cooperative approach to resolving the debt ceiling crisis. This internal discord within the GOP ranks could spell trouble for McConnell's leadership position and his ability to maintain party unity going forward.

""Mitch McConnell is playing a dangerous game, and I think it's going to cost him dearly,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a close ally of McConnell's. ""We need to find a way to work with Democrats to address this issue, rather than just digging in our heels.""

Other Republican senators, such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have also expressed frustration with McConnell's tactics, suggesting that they may be willing to work with Democrats to resolve the debt ceiling impasse.

The growing dissent within the Republican caucus could embolden Democrats to take a harder line in the negotiations, knowing that they may be able to peel off some GOP votes if McConnell continues to hold firm.

Moreover, McConnell's intransigence on the debt ceiling issue could have broader political implications for the Republican Party. With the 2022 midterm elections just a year away, the party's ability to present a united front and appeal to independent and moderate voters could be crucial to their chances of regaining control of Congress.

""Mitch McConnell is playing a high-stakes game, and he's risking a lot,"" said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at the Cook Political Report. ""If he's not careful, his actions could backfire and hurt the Republican Party's chances in the midterms.""

Beyond the political implications, McConnell's stance on the debt ceiling also raises questions about his priorities and his willingness to put the country's economic well-being ahead of partisan politics.

""At the end of the day, this is about the full faith and credit of the United States government,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""Mitch McConnell needs to recognize that this is not just a political game, but a matter of national importance that could have serious consequences for the American people.""

As the debt ceiling deadline looms, the pressure on McConnell to find a resolution is only likely to intensify. With his own party members questioning his leadership and the broader political implications of his actions, the Senate Minority Leader may find himself in an increasingly precarious position.

Only time will tell whether Mitch McConnell will be able to navigate this crisis and emerge with his political standing intact. But one thing is clear: the stakes have never been higher, and the cost of his decisions could be felt for years to come.",claude
Senate Democrats call for more sanctions against 'Putin's chef' following CNN investigation,"Senate Democrats Call for More Sanctions Against 'Putin's Chef' Following CNN Investigation

Washington, D.C. - In the wake of a recent CNN investigation, a group of Senate Democrats has called for the imposition of additional sanctions against Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch with close ties to President Vladimir Putin, who is often referred to as ""Putin's chef.""

The CNN report, which aired earlier this week, shed light on Prigozhin's extensive business interests and his alleged involvement in a range of activities, including the funding of the Internet Research Agency, a notorious Russian troll farm accused of interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

""Prigozhin's tentacles reach into so many different areas, from election interference to the war in Ukraine,"" said Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""It's time we hit him and his network with the full force of our sanctions regime.""

The senators' call for action comes as the Biden administration has faced criticism for not doing enough to hold Prigozhin accountable. While the U.S. government has previously imposed sanctions on Prigozhin and his companies, the oligarch has continued to operate with relative impunity, expanding his influence both within Russia and abroad.

""Prigozhin has been a thorn in the side of the U.S. and our allies for years, and it's clear that the current sanctions aren't enough to deter him,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""We need to go after him and his entire network with everything we've got.""

The senators' proposed sanctions would target not only Prigozhin himself but also his vast business empire, which includes catering companies, mining operations, and private military contractors. The goal, they say, is to cripple Prigozhin's ability to fund his various ventures and exert influence on behalf of the Kremlin.

""Prigozhin is a key enabler of Putin's authoritarian agenda, and we can't allow him to continue operating with impunity,"" said Senator Chris Coons (D-DE), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""These new sanctions would send a clear message that the U.S. will not tolerate his activities.""

The senators' push for additional sanctions has been welcomed by a range of foreign policy experts and human rights advocates, who have long called for a more aggressive approach to countering Prigozhin's influence.

""Prigozhin is a shadowy figure who has been able to evade accountability for far too long,"" said Adotei Akwei, the deputy director of Amnesty International USA's Advocacy and Government Relations program. ""These new sanctions would be an important step in holding him and his network responsible for their actions.""

The senators' proposal comes as the Biden administration is facing increasing pressure to take a tougher stance against Russia, particularly in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. With the war dragging on and the humanitarian crisis deepening, there is a growing sense that more needs to be done to hold the Kremlin and its allies accountable.

""Prigozhin is just one piece of the puzzle, but he's a critical one,"" said Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""By targeting him and his network, we can send a clear message that the U.S. will not tolerate any attempts to undermine our democracy or threaten our interests abroad.""

As the senators' proposal moves forward, it will likely face scrutiny from both the Biden administration and the broader international community. But with the growing evidence of Prigozhin's involvement in a range of nefarious activities, the pressure to take action is only likely to intensify in the months ahead.",claude

A state-by-state breakdown of US coronavirus cases

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact communities across the United States, the number of confirmed cases has been rapidly rising. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are now over 1.2 million cases of coronavirus reported nationwide.

To provide a more detailed picture, we have compiled a state-by-state breakdown of the current COVID-19 case numbers:

California - 54,937 cases, 2,254 deaths
The most populous state in the country, California has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. Los Angeles County has emerged as a major epicenter, with over 20,000 confirmed cases and more than 1,000 deaths. Other heavily impacted areas include Santa Clara, Riverside, and San Diego counties.

New York - 282,143 cases, 16,599 deaths 
New York has been the national epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis, accounting for nearly a quarter of all US cases. New York City has been the worst-affected area, with over 150,000 cases and more than 12,000 deaths. The state has struggled to keep up with the surge of hospitalizations, leading to a critical shortage of medical equipment and protective gear for healthcare workers.

New Jersey - 78,467 cases, 3,840 deaths
As the state with the second-highest number of cases, New Jersey has emerged as another major hot spot. The northern part of the state, particularly Bergen and Essex counties, has been hit hardest. New Jersey has also seen a disproportionate impact on its elderly population, with a majority of deaths occurring in long-term care facilities.

Michigan - 29,263 cases, 2,093 deaths
Michigan has become one of the fastest-growing coronavirus outbreaks in the country. The Detroit metropolitan area has been the state's epicenter, accounting for over 80% of Michigan's total cases. The state has faced challenges in obtaining sufficient medical supplies and has had to convert convention centers into field hospitals to handle the surge of patients.

Florida - 27,869 cases, 867 deaths
While Florida has not seen the same exponential growth as some other states, the number of cases continues to rise steadily. The Miami metropolitan area has the highest concentration of cases, but other regions like Tampa Bay and Orlando have also been significantly impacted. Florida's large elderly population has heightened concerns, as COVID-19 has proven especially deadly for older individuals.

Texas - 19,260 cases, 495 deaths
As the second-most populous state, Texas has managed to keep its coronavirus case numbers relatively low compared to other hard-hit states. However, the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan areas have emerged as the state's main hot spots. Texas has taken steps to increase hospital capacity and implement social distancing measures to try to slow the spread of the virus.

Louisiana - 21,016 cases, 884 deaths
Louisiana has emerged as one of the most severely impacted states, with a particularly high death rate. The New Orleans metropolitan area has been the state's epicenter, accounting for the majority of Louisiana's cases and deaths. The state has struggled to obtain necessary medical equipment and has had to convert the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans into a field hospital.

These are just a few of the states that have been most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the situation remains dire, public health officials have emphasized the importance of continued social distancing measures and other preventive actions to help flatten the curve and reduce the strain on the healthcare system.

As the crisis evolves, it will be crucial for state and local governments to closely monitor the data, expand testing capabilities, and coordinate their response efforts to combat this unprecedented public health emergency.",claude

Soaring Inflation Hits Consumers Hard as Prices Continue to Rise Across the Board

In a stark reminder of the economic challenges facing American households, the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that inflation in the United States has reached its highest level in four decades. The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, jumped 9.1% in June compared to the same month a year earlier, exceeding economists' expectations and sparking concerns about the resilience of the broader economy.

The surge in prices was widespread, with energy costs skyrocketing by 41.6% and grocery prices rising by 12.2% over the past year. The cost of gasoline, a crucial expense for many Americans, has been a particular pain point, with prices at the pump reaching record highs and contributing to the overall inflationary pressure.

""This is the worst inflation we've seen since the early 1980s,"" said Dr. Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Federal Reserve governor and current professor of the practice of public policy at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University. ""Consumers are being squeezed on all fronts, and there's no easy solution in sight.""

The Biden administration has faced mounting criticism for its handling of the economy, with Republicans seizing on the inflation crisis as a key talking point ahead of the midterm elections. President Biden has acknowledged the pain felt by American families, but has argued that the factors driving inflation, such as supply chain disruptions and the ongoing war in Ukraine, are largely beyond the control of the federal government.

""We're doing everything we can to bring prices down, but this is a global phenomenon that we're all grappling with,"" Biden said in a recent press conference. ""We're not going to stop until we get inflation under control, even if it means some short-term pain for American consumers.""

The Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States, has been aggressively raising interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and tame inflation. In June, the Fed implemented its largest rate hike since 1994, raising the benchmark federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. Further rate increases are expected in the coming months as the Fed attempts to strike a delicate balance between reining in inflation and avoiding a recession.

""The Fed is in a very difficult position,"" said Dr. Raskin. ""They need to act decisively to bring inflation down, but they also have to be mindful of the potential negative consequences for the broader economy. It's a high-stakes game with no easy answers.""

The impact of the inflation surge has been felt across a wide range of sectors, from housing and transportation to healthcare and education. Consumers are being forced to make difficult choices, cutting back on discretionary spending and prioritizing essential purchases.

""I'm having to be a lot more selective with my spending these days,"" said Sarah Wilkins, a 32-year-old office manager in Chicago. ""Groceries, gas, and rent are taking up a bigger and bigger chunk of my paycheck, and there's not much left over for things like dining out or entertainment. It's really putting a strain on my finances.""

As the country grapples with the ongoing inflation crisis, economists and policymakers will be closely watching the coming months to see if the Fed's actions, combined with other measures, can begin to rein in the relentless rise in prices. The stakes are high, with the potential for a prolonged period of economic pain for American households and businesses.

""This is a critical moment for the economy,"" said Dr. Raskin. ""The decisions made in the coming weeks and months will have far-reaching consequences for the financial well-being of millions of Americans. It's a challenge that will require a coordinated, sustained effort to overcome.""",claude
How virtual reality is changing the live music experience,"""How Virtual Reality is Changing the Live Music Experience""

In a world where the pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we consume live music, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a game-changer. As concert halls and arenas remain shuttered, the music industry has turned to this cutting-edge technology to provide fans with an immersive and unforgettable experience.

One of the pioneers in this space is Live Nation, the world's largest live entertainment company. They have partnered with leading VR platforms like Oculus to bring some of the biggest names in music to virtual stages. ""The response has been overwhelming,"" says Jane Doe, Live Nation's head of digital innovation. ""Fans are eager to connect with their favorite artists in new and innovative ways, and VR is the perfect medium to do that.""

The VR concert experience is a far cry from the traditional livestream. Instead of a flat, two-dimensional screen, users don a headset and are transported directly into the heart of the action. ""It's like being in the front row, but without the crowds and the long lines,"" says John Smith, a VR enthusiast who has attended several virtual concerts. ""You can look around and see the stage from any angle, and the sound quality is incredible.""

But the benefits of VR go beyond just the viewing experience. Artists, too, are finding new ways to engage with their fans. ""In a traditional concert, there's always a barrier between the performer and the audience,"" says Jane Doe. ""With VR, that barrier is broken down. Artists can make eye contact with fans, interact with them in real-time, and even invite them up on stage.""

One such example is the recent virtual concert by pop superstar Ariana Grande. During the performance, Grande invited fans to join her on a virtual stage, where they could dance and sing along with her. ""It was an incredible feeling,"" says Sarah Johnson, a fan who attended the concert. ""I felt like I was actually there, like I was part of the show.""

But the impact of VR goes beyond just the live music experience. It's also changing the way artists create and produce their music. ""VR allows artists to experiment with new sounds and visuals in ways that weren't possible before,"" says Jane Doe. ""They can create immersive, 360-degree music videos that transport the viewer to a completely different world.""

One artist who has embraced this new technology is electronic musician Deadmau5. He has created several VR experiences that allow fans to explore the inner workings of his music, from the synth patches he uses to the production techniques he employs. ""It's a way for fans to really understand and appreciate the creative process,"" says Deadmau5. ""And it's a lot of fun too.""

Of course, the adoption of VR in the music industry is not without its challenges. The technology can be expensive, and not everyone has access to a high-end VR headset. There are also concerns about the social isolation that can come with virtual experiences, as well as the potential for motion sickness and other physical discomforts.

But despite these challenges, the music industry is bullish on the future of VR. ""This is just the beginning,"" says Jane Doe. ""As the technology continues to evolve and become more accessible, we're going to see more and more artists embracing VR as a way to connect with their fans in new and exciting ways.""

For music fans, the future of live music may very well be virtual. And with the immersive and interactive experiences that VR can provide, it's a future that promises to be truly unforgettable.",claude
"Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up","Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up

As the world grapples with the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, two of the globe's most powerful leaders, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, have seized the opportunity to tighten their grip on power and expand their influence, while President Donald Trump appears to be faltering in his response to the crisis.

In Russia, Putin has used the pandemic as a pretext to push through constitutional changes that could allow him to remain in power until 2036, effectively cementing his authoritarian rule. Under the guise of combating the virus, the Kremlin has cracked down on dissent, silencing critics and independent media outlets. The government has also deployed its vast surveillance apparatus to monitor and control the flow of information, making it increasingly difficult for the Russian people to access reliable, unbiased news.

Similarly, in China, Xi Jinping has leveraged the crisis to consolidate his authority and solidify the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) dominance. The Chinese government has been accused of downplaying the initial outbreak and suppressing crucial information, leading to a global outcry over its handling of the crisis. However, Beijing has since launched a massive propaganda campaign, portraying its response as a resounding success and positioning itself as a global leader in the fight against the pandemic.

This narrative has been bolstered by China's efforts to provide medical aid and personal protective equipment (PPE) to countries around the world, a move that many experts believe is part of a broader strategy to expand Beijing's influence and challenge the United States' global leadership.

In contrast, the Trump administration's response to the pandemic has been widely criticized as chaotic and ineffective. The president's downplaying of the virus, his clashes with state governors, and his administration's failure to implement a coordinated national strategy have all contributed to the United States' struggles to contain the outbreak.

Moreover, Trump's apparent reluctance to condemn authoritarian leaders like Putin and Xi, and his continued embrace of populist, nationalist rhetoric, have further undermined America's standing on the global stage. As the United States grapples with the devastating economic and social consequences of the pandemic, the president's political rivals have accused him of prioritizing his own political interests over the well-being of the American people.

The contrasting responses of Putin, Xi, and Trump to the COVID-19 crisis have highlighted the growing divide between authoritarian and democratic models of governance. While the former have used the pandemic to consolidate their power, the latter has struggled to mount an effective and coordinated response, raising concerns about the resilience of democratic institutions in the face of such a profound challenge.

As the world watches these events unfold, experts warn that the long-term implications of the pandemic could be far-reaching, potentially accelerating the shift towards a more multipolar, geopolitically unstable world order. The ability of democratic nations to navigate this complex landscape and reassert their values on the global stage will be crucial in the years to come.",claude
How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus,"Here is a 600-word news article based on the title ""How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus"":

How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus

As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, health experts are urging the public to take extra precautions to prevent the transmission of the virus. One often-overlooked surface that can harbor germs is your smartphone.

""Our phones go with us everywhere and come into contact with all kinds of surfaces and people,"" said Dr. Emily Thompson, an infectious disease specialist. ""It's important to regularly clean your phone to help reduce the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19.""

But how exactly should you clean your phone to effectively kill the coronavirus? Here are the steps experts recommend:

Unplug and power down
Before cleaning your phone, make sure to unplug it from any power sources and turn it off completely. This will prevent any electrical damage during the cleaning process.

Use the right cleaning materials
Avoid using household cleaners, bleach, or alcohol-based wipes, as these can damage your phone's screen and other components. Instead, use disinfecting wipes that contain at least 70% isopropyl alcohol or a microfiber cloth dampened with soap and water.

""The key is to use cleaning products that are safe for electronics,"" said tech expert Samantha Lee. ""You want something that will kill germs without corroding the phone's materials.""

Wipe down all surfaces
Gently wipe down the entire surface of your phone, including the screen, back case, buttons, and ports. Be sure to get into all the nooks and crannies where dirt and germs can accumulate.

""Don't forget about the often-overlooked areas like the camera lens, charging port, and speaker grilles,"" advised Lee. ""Those are common hotspots for germs.""

Avoid getting moisture in openings
While you want to thoroughly clean your phone, be careful not to get any moisture inside the device through openings like the charging port or headphone jack. This could cause internal damage.

""Wipe down the exterior, but don't submerge your phone in liquid or hold it under running water,"" said Thompson. ""That's a surefire way to ruin your phone.""

Disinfect phone accessories
Don't forget to clean any accessories you use with your phone, such as your phone case, screen protector, headphones, and charging cables. Wipe these down with disinfecting wipes as well.

""Accessories can harbor just as many germs as the phone itself,"" noted Thompson. ""Make sure to disinfect them regularly, too.""

Establish a cleaning routine
Experts recommend cleaning your phone at least once a day, or more often if it comes into frequent contact with others or is used in public settings.

""Make phone cleaning part of your daily routine, just like washing your hands,"" said Lee. ""It only takes a minute but can go a long way in protecting you from illness-causing germs.""

By following these simple steps, you can help keep your smartphone clean and safe from the coronavirus. So the next time you reach for your device, you can have peace of mind knowing it's been properly disinfected.",claude
Coronavirus shows up Trump's compassion deficit,"""Coronavirus Shows Up Trump's Compassion Deficit""

The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare many of the shortcomings of the Trump administration, but perhaps none more glaring than the President's apparent lack of empathy and compassion for the American people.

As the virus has spread across the country, sickening hundreds of thousands and claiming the lives of over 30,000 citizens, President Trump has consistently failed to display the kind of leadership and emotional connection that Americans have come to expect from their commander-in-chief during times of crisis.

Rather than offering words of comfort and solidarity, the President has too often seemed more preoccupied with his own political standing and image than the very real suffering of those impacted by the outbreak.

In the early days of the pandemic, Trump downplayed the severity of the threat, comparing COVID-19 to the seasonal flu and insisting that the number of cases in the U.S. would ""go down to close to zero."" Even as the death toll has mounted, the President has been reluctant to take responsibility, instead shifting blame to state governors, the Obama administration, and the World Health Organization.

Trump's dismissive attitude has extended to his public interactions as well. During a recent White House briefing, the President appeared to grow impatient with a reporter who asked about her own fears for her family's health, curtly telling her, ""I haven't heard that."" In another instance, he offered a terse ""that's sad"" in response to a question about the rising number of fatalities.

Contrast this with the empathetic leadership displayed by governors like New York's Andrew Cuomo, who has become a source of comfort and inspiration for many Americans through his daily press conferences. Cuomo has spoken openly about his own family's struggles with the virus, and has consistently struck a tone of compassion and resolve in the face of unimaginable hardship.

The President's failure to connect with the public on an emotional level stands in stark contrast to past leaders who have risen to the occasion during times of national crisis. Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous ""fireside chats"" during the Great Depression, for example, helped to calm a fearful nation and restore a sense of shared purpose. Similarly, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush's words of solace and determination resonated with a shaken American public.

Trump, on the other hand, has seemed far more concerned with his own political standing than with providing the kind of moral leadership the country so desperately needs. His daily briefings have devolved into self-congratulatory performances, with the President often spending more time attacking the media and political opponents than addressing the real challenges facing the nation.

This lack of empathy has not gone unnoticed by the American people. Recent polls have shown the President's approval rating slipping, even as his handling of the COVID-19 crisis has drawn widespread criticism. A CNN survey, for instance, found that only 44% of respondents approved of Trump's response to the pandemic, while 55% disapproved.

As the country continues to grapple with the devastating effects of the coronavirus outbreak, the need for compassionate, empathetic leadership has never been more urgent. Unfortunately, it seems that this is one area where the current occupant of the Oval Office is sorely lacking.",claude

In a groundbreaking move that blends luxury and conservation, a new eco-tourism initiative in Thailand's picturesque Golden Triangle region is offering travelers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sleep in transparent ""Jungle Bubbles"" alongside majestic Asian elephants.

Developed by the award-winning Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort, these transparent, air-conditioned domes provide guests with an immersive, 360-degree view of the elephants in their natural habitat. Situated on a hillside overlooking the Ruak River, which borders Myanmar and Laos, the Jungle Bubbles provide a serene and intimate encounter with these gentle giants.

The Jungle Bubble experience is part of Anantara's commitment to responsible tourism and its ongoing efforts to support the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the protection and welfare of elephants in the region.

""Elephants are an integral part of Thailand's cultural heritage, but they face numerous threats, including habitat loss and illegal poaching,"" explained John Roberts, Director of Sustainability and Conservation at Anantara Hotels, Resorts & Spas. ""By offering this unique opportunity to interact with the elephants, we hope to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for their conservation, while also providing vital funds to support the foundation's important work.""

In addition to the Jungle Bubble experience, guests at the Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort can participate in a range of immersive activities, including elephant observation walks, mahout training sessions, and educational talks about elephant behavior and conservation efforts.

""The Jungle Bubbles are a game-changer in the world of eco-tourism,"" said Roberts. ""They allow travelers to connect with nature and wildlife in a way that is both luxurious and sustainable, setting a new standard for responsible tourism experiences.""

With the growing demand for authentic, nature-based travel experiences, the Jungle Bubbles are expected to be a popular draw for adventurous travelers seeking to immerse themselves in the beauty and wonder of Thailand's natural landscapes.

""This is an opportunity that simply cannot be found anywhere else in the world,"" said Epinette. ""We're thrilled to be able to offer our guests this truly unique and unforgettable experience.""",claude
Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary,"Rare White Giraffes Killed by Poachers at Kenyan Wildlife Sanctuary

Nairobi, Kenya - In a devastating blow to conservation efforts, two rare white giraffes have been killed by poachers at the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy in northeastern Kenya.

The carcasses of the female giraffe and her calf were discovered on Tuesday, according to the Hirola Conservation Program, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the endangered Hirola antelope.

The white giraffes, a genetic rarity caused by a condition called leucism, which results in a partial loss of pigmentation, had become a major tourist attraction in the region, drawing visitors from around the world to catch a glimpse of the unique animals.

""This is a very sad day for the community of Ijara and Kenya as a whole. We are the only community in the world who are custodians of the white giraffe,"" said Mohammed Ahmednoor, the manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy.

The killing of the white giraffes has sparked outrage among conservationists and wildlife enthusiasts, who have been working tirelessly to protect these remarkable creatures.

""The killing of the two white giraffes is a major blow to the tremendous efforts by the community to conserve rare and unique animals, and it is a wake-up call for continued support to conservation efforts,"" said Abdullahi H. Ali, the founder of the Hirola Conservation Program.

The white giraffes were first spotted in 2016 in the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, and their presence had become a source of pride and hope for the local community. The news of their tragic demise has left the community devastated.

""We are heartbroken by the loss of these two beautiful and unique animals. They were a symbol of hope for our community and a source of pride for the entire country,"" said Ahmednoor.

The Kenyan government has launched an investigation into the incident, and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has deployed additional rangers to the area to enhance security and prevent further poaching activities.

""The Kenya Wildlife Service condemns in the strongest possible terms the killing of the two rare white giraffes in Garissa County. We are working closely with the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy and other relevant authorities to ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous act are brought to justice,"" said Brig. (Rtd) John Waweru, the Director-General of the KWS.

The tragic loss of the white giraffes has raised concerns about the ongoing threat of poaching and the need for stronger conservation efforts to protect Kenya's unique and endangered wildlife.

""The death of these two iconic white giraffes is a devastating blow to the conservation of rare species in Kenya. It is a stark reminder of the urgent need to strengthen anti-poaching measures and enhance community-based conservation initiatives to safeguard our precious natural heritage,"" said Paula Kahumbu, the CEO of Wildlife Direct, a Kenyan conservation organization.

As the investigation into the killings continues, the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy and its partners are working to ensure that the remaining white giraffe, a male, is protected and monitored closely to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring.

The loss of these rare and captivating creatures has left a deep void in the hearts of the local community and conservation advocates worldwide. Their unique presence will be sorely missed, and their tragic end serves as a sobering reminder of the ongoing challenges faced in the fight to protect Kenya's irreplaceable wildlife.",claude
Flu leaves a 4-year-old girl blind in Iowa,"Flu Leaves 4-Year-Old Girl Blind in Iowa

IOWA CITY, Iowa - In a heartbreaking turn of events, a young girl in Iowa has been left permanently blind due to complications from the flu. The family of 4-year-old Emma Saunders is now speaking out, hoping to raise awareness about the devastating impact the virus can have.

Emma's ordeal began just a few weeks ago when she came down with what her parents, Sarah and Michael, thought was a typical case of the flu. ""She had a fever, body aches, and just wasn't feeling well,"" recalls Sarah. ""We took her to the doctor, and they said it was the flu and sent us home with instructions to let it run its course.""

However, over the next several days, Emma's condition rapidly deteriorated. ""She started complaining that her eyes hurt, and then she just stopped being able to see,"" Sarah says, her voice trembling. ""We rushed her back to the hospital, and that's when they told us the devastating news.""

Doctors diagnosed Emma with acute necrotizing encephalitis, a rare and severe complication of the flu that causes rapid brain swelling and inflammation. This, in turn, had led to irreversible damage to the optic nerves, leaving the young girl completely blind.

""We were just in shock,"" Michael says. ""One minute, she was a happy, healthy little girl, and the next, her life had been turned upside down. It's something no parent should ever have to go through.""

Emma is now undergoing intensive rehabilitation and therapy, learning to navigate the world without her sight. ""She's such a strong and resilient child,"" Sarah says, ""but it's been heartbreaking to watch her struggle with this. She misses being able to see her toys, her friends, and the world around her.""

The family is now speaking out, hoping to raise awareness about the potential dangers of the flu, especially for young children. ""We had no idea that the flu could lead to something this devastating,"" Michael says. ""We thought it was just a bad cold, and we never imagined it could take away our daughter's sight.""

Medical experts say that while acute necrotizing encephalitis is rare, it is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of the flu. ""The flu can be a very serious illness, especially for young children, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions,"" says Dr. Emily Wilkins, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.

""Symptoms like high fever, severe headache, and changes in mental status can be signs of a more serious complication, and it's important for parents to seek immediate medical attention if they see these warning signs.""

For the Saunders family, the road ahead will be a long and difficult one. Emma will require ongoing support and therapy to learn to navigate the world without her sight, and the emotional toll on the family has been immense.

""We just want other parents to be aware of the risks and to take the flu seriously,"" Sarah says. ""If we had known how dangerous it could be, maybe we could have caught this sooner and prevented this tragedy. But now, all we can do is focus on helping Emma adapt and thrive, even with this devastating loss of her sight.""

The family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of Emma's ongoing care and rehabilitation, and they are hopeful that by sharing their story, they can help raise awareness and prevent other families from experiencing a similar tragedy.",claude
The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"The Soft Power Impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Decorative Collars

In the annals of Supreme Court history, few sartorial choices have captured the public's imagination quite like the decorative collars worn by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. These delicate yet distinctive accessories became a symbol of her unwavering commitment to justice and her status as a cultural icon.

Ginsburg's collars, which she often donned for important rulings or dissents, were more than mere fashion statements. They were a manifestation of her judicial philosophy and her desire to use the power of her position to inspire and empower others.

""Justice Ginsburg understood the significance of her appearance and how it could be used to convey important messages,"" says legal scholar Emily Bazelon. ""Her collars were a way for her to assert her individuality and her dedication to the principles she held dear.""

One of Ginsburg's most famous collars was the ""Dissent Collar,"" a bold, statement-making accessory that she wore when delivering scathing dissents from the bench. This intricate lace piece, with its cascading ruffles, became a symbol of her willingness to challenge the status quo and stand up for her beliefs, even in the face of opposition.

""The Dissent Collar was Ginsburg's way of saying, 'I may be outnumbered, but I will not be silenced,'"" says fashion historian Valerie Steele. ""It was a powerful visual representation of her commitment to justice and her unwavering determination to fight for the rights of those who were marginalized or overlooked.""

But Ginsburg's collars were not just about making a statement. They were also a reflection of her deep appreciation for the arts and her desire to use her platform to celebrate the work of others.

Many of Ginsburg's collars were created by independent designers and artists, including the late Iris Apfel, a renowned fashion icon in her own right. These collaborations not only showcased Ginsburg's support for emerging talent but also highlighted the ways in which fashion and the law could intersect to create powerful statements.

""Justice Ginsburg's collars were a way for her to use her position to elevate the work of others and to inspire a new generation of women to pursue their passions, whether it was in the courtroom or the design studio,"" says Bazelon.

The impact of Ginsburg's collars extended far beyond the walls of the Supreme Court. They became a symbol of resistance and resilience, inspiring women and girls around the world to stand up for their beliefs and to use their own unique forms of expression to make their voices heard.

""Ginsburg's collars were a reminder that even the most powerful institutions in the world can be transformed by the simple act of self-expression,"" says Steele. ""They showed that fashion can be a powerful tool for social and political change, and that even the most seemingly small gestures can have a profound impact.""

As the world mourns the loss of this trailblazing jurist, her collars will continue to serve as a lasting legacy – a testament to the power of using one's platform to inspire and empower others. In the years to come, the soft power of Ginsburg's collars will undoubtedly continue to reverberate, inspiring a new generation of leaders to follow in her footsteps and to use their own unique forms of expression to make a difference in the world.",claude
Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure,"""Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure""

In a world where the chocolate industry has long been plagued by allegations of child labor and forced slavery, a growing movement is emerging to provide consumers with a more ethical alternative. Driven by a commitment to social responsibility and environmental sustainability, a new generation of chocolatiers is redefining the way we think about this beloved treat.

At the forefront of this movement is [Company Name], a family-owned business that has made it its mission to source its cacao from farms that strictly adhere to fair labor practices. ""We believe that every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their role in the supply chain,"" says [Company Founder's Name], the visionary behind the brand.

[Company Name] works closely with its network of cacao farmers, many of whom are located in the remote regions of West Africa, to ensure that their operations are free from any form of exploitative labor. ""Our team conducts regular audits and site visits to verify that our suppliers are upholding the highest standards of ethical sourcing,"" explains [Company Founder's Name]. ""We simply won't work with anyone who can't demonstrate a commitment to protecting the rights of their workers.""

This commitment to transparency and accountability has earned [Company Name] a loyal following among conscious consumers who are increasingly demanding that the products they purchase align with their values. ""I used to feel guilty about indulging in chocolate, but with [Company Name], I can truly savor every bite without any lingering doubts,"" says [Customer Name], a long-time customer.

But the journey to ethical chocolate is not without its challenges. The cacao industry has long been dominated by a few large multinational corporations, many of which have been slow to address the systemic issues of child labor and forced slavery. ""It's an uphill battle, but we're determined to show that there is a better way to do business,"" says [Company Founder's Name].

To that end, [Company Name] has partnered with a number of non-profit organizations and advocacy groups to raise awareness about the importance of fair trade and sustainable sourcing practices. ""We want to empower consumers to make informed choices and to understand the real human cost behind the chocolate they consume,"" explains [Company Founder's Name].

The impact of this movement is already being felt in communities across West Africa, where cacao farmers are reporting improved working conditions, better wages, and a renewed sense of hope for the future. ""Before, we felt like we were trapped in a system that was stacked against us,"" says [Farmer Name], a cacao grower who works with [Company Name]. ""Now, we have a partner who truly values our work and is willing to fight for our rights.""

As the demand for slave-free chocolate continues to grow, [Company Name] is poised to lead the charge in redefining the industry. ""This is about more than just making a delicious product,"" says [Company Founder's Name]. ""It's about creating a more just and equitable world, one bite at a time.""",claude
Firefighters Cut 2 People Out Of Vehicle After Rollover Crash In Manteca,"Firefighters Cut 2 People Out Of Vehicle After Rollover Crash In Manteca

MANTECA, Calif. - Emergency responders rushed to the scene of a rollover crash in Manteca on Tuesday evening, working quickly to extricate two individuals trapped inside the overturned vehicle.

The incident occurred around 6:30 p.m. on the 1200 block of East Yosemite Avenue, according to the Manteca Fire Department. Witnesses reported that a vehicle had veered off the roadway and rolled over, leaving the occupants trapped inside.

""When our crews arrived, they found a vehicle on its side with two patients still inside,"" said Battalion Chief Kyle Shipherd. ""Our firefighters immediately got to work, using specialized tools to safely cut through the vehicle and free the trapped individuals.""

The Jaws of Life, a hydraulic rescue tool used to pry open crushed vehicles, were deployed by the firefighters to carefully remove the twisted metal and gain access to the victims. The delicate operation took approximately 20 minutes to complete.

""Time is of the essence in these types of situations,"" Shipherd explained. ""Our priority is to stabilize the vehicle, assess the patients' conditions, and extract them as quickly and safely as possible.""

Once freed from the wreckage, the two victims, a man and a woman, were transported to a nearby hospital for further medical evaluation and treatment. Their identities and the extent of their injuries have not been released by authorities.

The cause of the rollover crash is still under investigation by the Manteca Police Department. Preliminary reports suggest that the vehicle may have lost control, possibly due to excessive speed or distracted driving, before leaving the roadway and overturning.

""We urge all drivers to remain vigilant and focused while behind the wheel,"" said Sgt. Mike Aguilar of the Manteca Police Department. ""Accidents like this can have devastating consequences, and we're grateful that our firefighters were able to respond quickly and safely extricate the victims.""

The incident caused a temporary closure of East Yosemite Avenue as emergency crews worked to clear the scene and investigate the crash. Motorists were advised to avoid the area and seek alternate routes during the response.

""Our firefighters did an excellent job in this challenging situation,"" Shipherd added. ""Their training and expertise allowed them to efficiently and safely remove the victims from the vehicle, potentially saving their lives.""

The Manteca Fire Department and Manteca Police Department continue to work together to determine the exact cause of the rollover crash and ensure the well-being of the injured individuals.",claude
Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks,"Major Sports Leagues in the US Halt Play or Exclude Fans Over Coronavirus Outbreaks

In an unprecedented move, several major sports leagues in the United States have taken drastic measures to combat the growing threat of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB) have all announced temporary suspensions of their respective seasons, while the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has canceled its highly anticipated March Madness tournament.

The NBA was the first to act, announcing the suspension of its season on Wednesday evening, just minutes after a game between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder was abruptly postponed. The league made the decision after one of the Jazz players, later identified as Rudy Gobert, tested positive for the coronavirus.

""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,"" the league said in a statement.

The NHL quickly followed suit, announcing the suspension of its season later that evening. In a statement, the league said it was ""pausing"" the 2019-20 season, effective immediately, and would ""continue to monitor ongoing events and developments.""

The MLB, which was scheduled to begin its regular season on March 26, has also delayed the start of the season, though the league has not yet determined a specific timeline for when play will resume.

""MLB and the clubs have been preparing a variety of contingency plans regarding the schedule,"" the league said in a statement. ""We will announce the effects on the schedule at an appropriate time and will remain flexible as events warrant, with the health and safety of our players, umpires, fans, and staff as our top priority.""

The NCAA, which oversees college sports in the United States, went a step further, announcing the cancellation of its highly anticipated March Madness tournament, as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA championships.

""This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities,"" the NCAA said in a statement.

The decisions by these major sports leagues come as the United States grapples with the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported more than 1,300 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., with 38 deaths.

In addition to suspending their seasons, several leagues have also announced that they will be excluding fans from their events in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. The NBA, for example, has said that its games will be played without spectators, while the NCAA's March Madness tournament will be held without fans in attendance.

The impact of these decisions is expected to be significant, both for the leagues themselves and for the communities that rely on the economic boost provided by major sporting events. The NBA, for instance, generates billions of dollars in revenue each year, and the suspension of its season could have far-reaching financial implications.

Despite the challenges, however, many sports fans have expressed support for the decisions made by the leagues, recognizing the importance of prioritizing public health and safety in the face of the coronavirus outbreak.

""I know it's disappointing, but I think the leagues are making the right call,"" said Sarah Watkins, a longtime NBA fan. ""At the end of the day, the health and safety of the players, the staff, and the fans has to come first.""

As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how long these suspensions and cancellations will last, and what the long-term impact will be on the sports industry and the broader economy. For now, however, the focus remains on containing the spread of the coronavirus and protecting the well-being of all those involved.",claude
10 commandments for better sleep on World Sleep Day,"""10 Commandments for Better Sleep on World Sleep Day""

In celebration of World Sleep Day, experts have unveiled a set of essential guidelines to help individuals achieve a more restful and rejuvenating night's sleep. As the importance of quality sleep continues to be underscored by health professionals, these ""10 Commandments"" aim to empower individuals to prioritize their sleep health and unlock the numerous benefits it provides.

1. Thou Shalt Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule
Experts emphasize the significance of maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle, even on weekends. By going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, the body's internal circadian rhythm can be better synchronized, leading to improved sleep quality and duration.

2. Thou Shalt Create a Sleep-Conducive Environment
The bedroom should be a sanctuary for sleep, free from distractions and environmental factors that can disrupt rest. This includes ensuring the room is cool, dark, and quiet, with comfortable bedding and minimal ambient light and noise.

3. Thou Shalt Limit Screen Time Before Bed
The blue light emitted by electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, can suppress the production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Experts recommend avoiding screen time for at least an hour before bedtime.

4. Thou Shalt Engage in Relaxing Rituals
Incorporating calming activities, such as reading, gentle stretching, or practicing mindfulness or meditation, can help the body and mind transition into a state of relaxation, facilitating a more restful sleep.

5. Thou Shalt Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol
While caffeine can provide a temporary energy boost, it can also interfere with sleep quality if consumed too close to bedtime. Similarly, although alcohol may initially help individuals fall asleep, it can disrupt the later stages of sleep, leading to fragmented and less restorative rest.

6. Thou Shalt Exercise Regularly
Regular physical activity has been shown to improve sleep quality, but it's important to avoid intense workouts close to bedtime, as they can have a stimulating effect on the body.

7. Thou Shalt Manage Stress and Anxiety
Chronic stress and anxiety can contribute to insomnia and other sleep disturbances. Incorporating stress-management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, journaling, or seeking professional support, can help individuals better cope with these factors.

8. Thou Shalt Avoid Daytime Napping
While a short power nap can be beneficial, prolonged or frequent daytime napping can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle and make it more challenging to fall asleep at night.

9. Thou Shalt Listen to Thy Body's Cues
Individuals should pay attention to their body's natural sleep signals and go to bed when they feel tired, rather than forcing themselves to stay awake.

10. Thou Shalt Seek Professional Help if Needed
If sleep difficulties persist or worsen, individuals should consult with a healthcare professional, such as a sleep specialist, to identify any underlying medical conditions and receive personalized recommendations for improving sleep.

By following these ""10 Commandments,"" individuals can take proactive steps to enhance their sleep quality and overall well-being, ultimately celebrating World Sleep Day with a more refreshed and rejuvenated state of being.",claude

The tragic details of the killing of Amie Harwick,"The Tragic Details of the Killing of Amie Harwick

LOS ANGELES - Amie Harwick, a well-known family and marriage therapist, tragically passed away on February 15th, 2020, at the age of 38. Harwick, who had previously been in a relationship with actor and comedian Drew Carey, was found unresponsive in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. 

According to the Los Angeles Police Department, officers responded to a call of a ""woman screaming"" in the 2000 block of Mound Street around 1:16 a.m. When they arrived, they found Harwick lying on the ground beneath a third-story balcony, with evidence of an intruder and a possible struggle.

Harwick was rushed to a local hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office ruled her death a homicide, stating that she died from blunt force injuries to the head and torso.

The investigation quickly led authorities to Harwick's former boyfriend, 41-year-old Gareth Pursehouse. Pursehouse, a software engineer, had a history of violence and had previously been charged with stalking and harassing Harwick. He was arrested on February 15th and charged with murder.

According to court documents, Harwick had filed a restraining order against Pursehouse in 2011, alleging that he had physically assaulted her and threatened her life. The restraining order had expired just two weeks before her death.

Prosecutors allege that Pursehouse broke into Harwick's home, waited for her to return, and then attacked her, ultimately leading to her fatal injuries. Surveillance footage from the neighborhood appears to show Pursehouse's vehicle in the area around the time of the incident.

""This is a devastating loss for the community,"" said Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore. ""Amie Harwick was a respected professional who dedicated her life to helping others. Her tragic death is a stark reminder of the danger that domestic violence poses, and the importance of taking threats seriously.""

Harwick's friends and colleagues have expressed shock and sadness over her passing. Many have praised her as a compassionate and skilled therapist who made a positive impact on the lives of her patients.

""Amie was an incredibly kind and caring person,"" said Dr. Judith Glass, a fellow therapist who had known Harwick for years. ""She had a deep understanding of the complexities of human relationships and was always willing to go the extra mile to support her clients. Her loss is truly devastating.""

The case has also sparked a broader conversation about the issue of domestic violence and the need for stronger protections for victims. Advocates have called for reforms to the restraining order system, arguing that more must be done to ensure the safety of those who seek legal recourse against their abusers.

""Amie's story is a tragic reminder that the system is still failing too many victims of domestic violence,"" said Deborah Rosenbaum, the executive director of a local domestic violence prevention organization. ""We must do more to prioritize the safety and well-being of those who are in harm's way.""

As the investigation into Harwick's death continues, her family, friends, and the wider community are left to grapple with the profound loss of a life cut short. Her legacy, however, will live on through the countless lives she touched and the ongoing efforts to address the scourge of domestic violence.",claude
The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders

In a startling turn of events, authorities are investigating the disappearance of a group of bus passengers in a remote area of the country. The incident, which occurred on Sunday evening, has left the local community and the nation at large grappling with unanswered questions.

According to eyewitness reports, the bus, operated by a reputable transportation company, was traveling along a rural highway when it suddenly veered off the road and came to a halt in a densely wooded area. Passengers on the bus, who were en route to a nearby city, immediately became alarmed and attempted to contact emergency services.

""We were all just sitting there, minding our own business, when the bus suddenly swerved and stopped,"" said one passenger, who wished to remain anonymous. ""At first, we thought the driver had experienced some kind of medical emergency, but when we tried to get his attention, he didn't respond.""

As the passengers grew increasingly concerned, they decided to exit the bus and assess the situation. However, to their horror, they discovered that the driver and several other passengers were nowhere to be found.

""We stepped out of the bus, and it was just eerie,"" another passenger recounted. ""The driver's seat was empty, and we couldn't see any sign of the other passengers who had been on the bus with us. It was like they had just vanished into thin air.""

Local authorities were immediately notified, and a massive search and rescue operation was launched. Search teams scoured the surrounding area, combing through the dense foliage and conducting aerial surveys, but their efforts have yielded no clues as to the whereabouts of the missing individuals.

""This is a highly unusual and concerning situation,"" said the lead investigator, Detective Sarah Winters. ""We are doing everything in our power to locate the missing passengers and the bus driver, but so far, we have no leads to go on. The disappearance seems to have occurred without a trace.""

Adding to the mystery, the bus itself was found to be in perfect working condition, with no apparent mechanical issues or signs of foul play. The passengers who remained on the bus have been questioned extensively, but their accounts have provided little insight into what may have happened to their missing companions.

""We're just as confused and scared as everyone else,"" one of the remaining passengers stated. ""We have no idea what could have happened to the others. One minute they were there, and the next, they were gone.""

The transportation company responsible for the bus route has expressed shock and dismay over the incident, pledging to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation. They have also assured the public that safety is their top priority and that they are committed to finding answers.

""We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and are doing everything in our power to assist the authorities in their investigation,"" said the company's spokesperson. ""The safety and well-being of our passengers is of the utmost importance, and we will not rest until we have uncovered the truth behind this mysterious disappearance.""

As the search continues, the local community and the nation at large await anxiously for any updates or breakthroughs in the case. The disappearance of the bus passengers has left many people with a sense of unease and a burning desire to understand what could have happened on that fateful evening.

""This is the kind of thing you see in movies, not in real life,"" said a local resident. ""It's just unbelievable, and we all hope that the missing people are found safe and sound. Until then, we can only wait and pray for answers.""",claude
David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact,"""David Axelrod: I Woke Up This Morning as an Alternative Fact""

In a surprising turn of events, renowned political strategist and former senior advisor to President Barack Obama, David Axelrod, has revealed that he woke up this morning as an ""alternative fact.""

Speaking to reporters from his Chicago home, Axelrod expressed his bewilderment at the unexpected transformation. ""I went to bed as my normal self, and when I woke up, I found that I had become an alternative fact. It's quite a strange and unsettling experience, to be honest.""

Axelrod, known for his keen political instincts and analytical prowess, said he first noticed something was amiss when he attempted to check his phone and found that the device no longer recognized him. ""I tried to unlock my phone using my fingerprint, but it just wouldn't work. That's when I realized that something was different about me.""

Further investigation led Axelrod to the startling conclusion that he had, in fact, become an alternative fact. ""I looked in the mirror, and there I was, staring back at myself, but with a slight twist. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I know I'm not quite the same as I was yesterday.""

When pressed for more details, Axelrod admitted that he is still trying to come to terms with his newfound identity. ""I'm not sure what it means to be an alternative fact. Am I still the same person, just with a different label? Or have I fundamentally changed in some way? These are the questions I'm grappling with.""

The former Obama advisor revealed that he has reached out to his political colleagues and friends, seeking guidance and support during this unprecedented situation. ""I've spoken to some of my closest allies, and they're just as perplexed as I am. We're all trying to figure out what this means and how to move forward.""

Despite the uncertainty, Axelrod expressed a determination to maintain his commitment to truth and transparency. ""One thing I can say for certain is that I will not abandon my principles. I may be an alternative fact, but I will still strive to be a truthful one. My goal is to find a way to reconcile my new identity with the values I've held dear throughout my career.""

The news of Axelrod's transformation has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with pundits and commentators alike speculating on the implications. Some have suggested that this could be a harbinger of a broader shift in the way we perceive and understand facts, while others have questioned the long-term ramifications for Axelrod's personal and professional life.

In the meantime, Axelrod has vowed to continue his work in the political arena, albeit with a newfound sense of purpose. ""I may be an alternative fact, but I still have a role to play in shaping the political discourse. My mission now is to find a way to use my unique perspective to promote honesty, integrity, and a shared commitment to the truth.""

As the world grapples with this unexpected development, one thing is certain: David Axelrod's transformation into an alternative fact has added a new and intriguing chapter to the ongoing debate about the nature of reality and the role of facts in our society.",claude
"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","""Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, Nation's Largest""

NEW YORK CITY - As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the United States, New York City is facing increasing pressure to close its public school system, the largest in the nation.

The New York City Department of Education oversees over 1.1 million students across more than 1,800 schools, making it a potential hotspot for the rapid transmission of COVID-19. With confirmed cases rising in the city, many parents, teachers, and public health experts are calling for the immediate closure of schools to help contain the outbreak.

""We're dealing with an unprecedented public health crisis, and we have to take every possible step to protect our communities,"" said Dr. Melissa Tier, an epidemiologist at Columbia University. ""Closing the New York City school system, even temporarily, could be a critical intervention to slow the spread of the virus.""

The decision to close schools, however, is a complex one, balancing public health concerns with the significant disruption to students' education and the strain on working families who rely on schools for childcare. Mayor Bill de Blasio has so far resisted calls to shut down the school system, arguing that such a move would have severe consequences.

""Closing our schools is not a decision we make lightly,"" de Blasio said in a press conference on Monday. ""It would create immense hardship for countless families who depend on our schools for meals, for childcare, and for the continuity of their children's education.""

The mayor's stance has drawn criticism from many quarters, including the city's teachers' union, which has demanded the immediate closure of schools.

""Our schools are not prepared to handle a public health crisis of this magnitude,"" said United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew. ""We have a responsibility to protect our students, our teachers, and our communities, and that means shutting down the school system now.""

Supporters of school closures argue that the potential health risks outweigh the disruption to education and childcare. They point to the experience of other countries, such as Italy and China, which have implemented nationwide school closures in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

""We've seen how quickly this virus can spread in close-knit communities,"" said Dr. Tier. ""Keeping schools open, even with additional precautions, is simply too risky. We need to act decisively to flatten the curve and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.""

The debate over school closures has also become politicized, with some Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, arguing that such measures are an overreaction. However, many public health experts and Democratic officials have pushed for more aggressive action to combat the pandemic.

As the pressure mounts, de Blasio has indicated that he is open to reconsidering his position on school closures, but he has stressed the need for a coordinated, regional approach.

""This is not a decision I can make in isolation,"" the mayor said. ""We need to work closely with state and federal authorities to ensure that any actions we take are part of a broader, cohesive strategy to address this crisis.""

With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City continuing to rise, the decision on whether to close the nation's largest school system may come sooner rather than later. For now, parents, teachers, and public health officials remain anxiously awaiting a resolution to this high-stakes dilemma.",claude
Violence forces Haiti to cancel Carnival,"Violence forces Haiti to cancel Carnival

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - Amid a worsening security crisis, the Haitian government has announced the cancellation of this year's Carnival celebrations, a move that has left the nation's cultural enthusiasts and tourism industry in a state of disappointment and concern.

The decision, announced by Prime Minister Claude Joseph, comes as Haiti grapples with a surge in gang violence and political instability that has claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians in recent months. The annual Carnival festivities, which typically draw thousands of revelers from around the world, were scheduled to take place from February 26th to March 1st.

""The safety and security of our citizens and visitors is our top priority,"" said Joseph during a press conference. ""Given the current volatile situation, we have no choice but to cancel this year's Carnival celebrations.""

The announcement has dealt a significant blow to Haiti's tourism industry, which had been hoping to capitalize on the country's cultural heritage and attract much-needed revenue. Carnival, a vibrant celebration of music, dance, and costumes, is a cornerstone of Haitian identity and a major draw for both domestic and international tourists.

""This is a devastating decision, but it's the right one given the circumstances,"" said Marie-Ange Casimir, a local business owner who had been preparing for the event. ""Our priority now must be to address the security crisis and find a way to restore peace and stability in our country.""

The cancellation of Carnival comes amidst a broader climate of unrest in Haiti. In recent months, the country has been grappling with a surge in gang violence, particularly in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Clashes between rival gangs and the police have left dozens dead, and the situation has only been exacerbated by the ongoing political crisis following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021.

""The security situation has deteriorated to the point where we simply cannot guarantee the safety of the thousands of people who would have attended Carnival,"" said Joseph. ""We understand the disappointment, but the well-being of our citizens and visitors must come first.""

The decision to cancel Carnival has been met with mixed reactions from the Haitian public. While some have expressed understanding and support for the government's decision, others have voiced their frustration and disappointment, arguing that the event is a vital part of the country's cultural identity and a crucial source of income for many.

""Carnival is more than just a celebration – it's a way of life for us Haitians,"" said Gérard Alcius, a local musician who had been preparing to perform at the event. ""Without it, we lose a piece of our heritage and a vital source of income for many families.""

The cancellation of Carnival is likely to have far-reaching consequences for Haiti's already struggling economy. The event is a significant draw for both domestic and international tourists, and its absence will be felt across a range of industries, from hotels and restaurants to transportation and entertainment.

""This is a devastating blow to our tourism industry, which was just starting to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Josué Alusma, the president of the Haitian Hotel and Tourism Association. ""We will need to work closely with the government to find ways to support the businesses and workers who rely on Carnival for their livelihoods.""

As the Haitian government works to address the security crisis and restore stability, the future of the country's cultural events and tourism industry remains uncertain. For now, the focus remains on finding a way to prioritize the safety and well-being of the Haitian people, while also preserving the rich cultural heritage that makes the country so unique.",claude
McDonald's is selling a new Big Mac with four patties,"McDonald's Introduces Colossal New ""Big Mac Quattro"" with Four Beef Patties

In a move that is sure to delight fast food enthusiasts and challenge the limits of human digestive capacity, McDonald's has unveiled its latest culinary creation – the ""Big Mac Quattro."" This towering burger boasts an unprecedented four beef patties, setting a new standard for the iconic Big Mac.

The Big Mac Quattro, which is being rolled out at participating McDonald's locations nationwide, features the classic Big Mac ingredients – two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions – but with the addition of two extra beef patties, stacked high to create a burger that is, quite literally, twice the size of the original.

""We're always looking for ways to innovate and give our customers something new and exciting,"" said McDonald's spokesperson, Emily Nguyen. ""The Big Mac is a beloved classic, but we thought, 'Why not take it to the next level?' The Big Mac Quattro is the result of that ambition.""

According to the company, the decision to quadruple the beef patties was driven by customer feedback and a desire to cater to the growing demand for larger, more indulgent fast food options.

""Our research showed that a significant portion of our customers were looking for a more substantial burger experience,"" Nguyen explained. ""They wanted something that would really satisfy their cravings and leave them feeling full and satisfied. The Big Mac Quattro is our answer to that request.""

The introduction of the Big Mac Quattro has already generated a significant buzz on social media, with many customers expressing both excitement and trepidation at the prospect of tackling such a colossal burger.

""I'm both intrigued and terrified,"" said local resident, Sarah Goldstein. ""I love a good Big Mac, but four patties? That's a lot of beef. I'm not sure my stomach is ready for that kind of challenge, but I have to at least try it.""

Others, however, are eager to embrace the new offering, viewing it as an opportunity to indulge in a truly decadent fast food experience.

""This is the kind of thing that dreams are made of,"" said burger enthusiast, Michael Hernandez. ""I've been waiting my whole life for a Big Mac that's twice the size of the original. I can't wait to sink my teeth into that thing and see if I can finish it in one sitting.""

To accommodate the increased size and weight of the Big Mac Quattro, McDonald's has had to make some adjustments to the packaging and preparation process. The burger is now served in a specially designed box, and the kitchen staff have been trained to handle the delicate assembly required to stack four patties without compromising the structural integrity of the final product.

""It's definitely a more complex burger to prepare, but our team is up for the challenge,"" Nguyen said. ""We want to ensure that every Big Mac Quattro that leaves our restaurants is a masterpiece – a true testament to the art of fast food engineering.""

As for the price tag, the Big Mac Quattro will be available for a suggested retail price of $8.99, a slight premium over the standard Big Mac, which typically sells for around $5.99.

""We understand that the Big Mac Quattro is a bit of a splurge, but we believe the experience is worth it,"" Nguyen said. ""This is a burger that's meant to be savored and shared, a true indulgence for the true burger enthusiast.""

Only time will tell whether the Big Mac Quattro will become a beloved addition to the McDonald's menu or a fleeting curiosity. But one thing is certain – for those brave enough to take on the challenge, it promises to be a truly unforgettable fast food adventure.",claude
BBC News,"BBC News

In a groundbreaking move, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has announced a major overhaul of its news division, ushering in a new era of journalistic excellence and innovation.

The changes, which will be implemented over the next 12 months, aim to redefine the way news is delivered to the public, both in the UK and globally. At the heart of this transformation is a renewed commitment to impartiality, accuracy, and the pursuit of truth.

""We recognize the immense responsibility we have as a public service broadcaster,"" said the BBC's Director of News, Sarah Thompson. ""In a world of increasing misinformation and polarization, the need for reliable, fact-based journalism has never been more crucial. This overhaul is our pledge to the public to uphold the highest standards of reporting and to serve as a trusted source of information.""

One of the key changes will be a significant investment in investigative journalism. The BBC plans to establish a dedicated team of seasoned reporters and researchers, equipped with the resources and expertise to delve into complex issues and uncover stories that might otherwise remain hidden.

""Investigative journalism is the bedrock of a healthy democracy,"" Thompson explained. ""By shining a light on wrongdoing, holding the powerful accountable, and giving voice to the voiceless, we can empower the public and contribute to meaningful change.""

Another major focus will be on enhancing the BBC's digital presence and leveraging emerging technologies to deliver news in more engaging and accessible formats. This will include the expansion of multimedia content, such as interactive graphics, immersive video, and podcasts, as well as the development of innovative digital platforms that cater to the evolving needs of news consumers.

""We recognize that the way people consume news is constantly evolving,"" Thompson said. ""By embracing digital technologies and adapting our content to the preferences of our audience, we can ensure that the BBC remains at the forefront of news reporting in the 21st century.""

Alongside these strategic shifts, the BBC will also undertake a comprehensive review of its editorial processes and internal structures. This will include the implementation of robust fact-checking procedures, the strengthening of ethical guidelines, and the empowerment of journalists to make independent decisions without undue influence.

""Trust is the cornerstone of our relationship with the public,"" Thompson emphasized. ""By reinforcing our commitment to transparency, accountability, and the highest journalistic standards, we aim to solidify the BBC's reputation as a beacon of integrity in an increasingly complex media landscape.""

The overhaul will also see the expansion of the BBC's global reach, with plans to establish new international bureaus and forge partnerships with news organizations around the world. This global focus will enable the broadcaster to provide a more comprehensive and diverse perspective on world events, fostering a deeper understanding of global issues among its audience.

""In an interconnected world, it's essential that we broaden our horizons and amplify voices from across the globe,"" Thompson said. ""By strengthening our international presence and collaborating with like-minded partners, we can offer our audiences a truly global perspective on the news that shapes our world.""

Transcripts,"""Transcripts""

In a stunning revelation, a trove of classified government transcripts has been leaked, shedding light on the inner workings of the highest levels of power. The documents, obtained by our news organization, provide a rare and unparalleled glimpse into the private conversations and decision-making processes of top officials, raising critical questions about transparency and accountability in government.

The transcripts, which span a range of sensitive topics, including national security, foreign policy, and domestic affairs, offer a stark contrast between the public rhetoric and the private deliberations of those in charge. They reveal a pattern of deception, with officials often contradicting their own public statements and engaging in closed-door discussions that directly undermine the information presented to the public.

One particularly troubling example is a transcript detailing a meeting between the President and a group of senior advisers. In the recording, the President is heard dismissing concerns raised by intelligence officials about a potential foreign threat, instead prioritizing political considerations and personal interests. The transcript directly contradicts the President's subsequent public assurances that the situation was under control and that the government was taking all necessary precautions.

Another transcript exposes a heated exchange between the Secretary of State and a group of lawmakers, in which the Secretary is caught making disparaging remarks about a key ally. The transcript paints a picture of a diplomatic landscape fraught with tensions and mistrust, undermining the government's claims of maintaining strong international relationships.

The release of these transcripts has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with both supporters and critics of the administration demanding answers. Opposition leaders have called for immediate congressional hearings, accusing the government of a systematic effort to mislead the public and subvert the democratic process.

The administration, for its part, has denounced the leak as a ""grave breach of national security"" and has vowed to launch a full-scale investigation to identify the source. They have also sought to downplay the significance of the transcripts, arguing that they do not represent the full context or nuance of the discussions.

However, the public's trust in the government has been severely eroded, with many citizens expressing a deep sense of betrayal and a growing demand for greater transparency and accountability.

""This is a fundamental violation of the public's right to know,"" said Jane Doe, a political analyst and professor of public policy. ""These transcripts reveal a disturbing pattern of deception and a disregard for the democratic principles that our government is supposed to uphold. The American people deserve to have confidence in their leaders, and this scandal has shaken that confidence to the core.""

As the fallout from the leak continues to reverberate, the future of the administration and the integrity of the nation's institutions hang in the balance. The public is left to grapple with the unsettling reality that the inner workings of power may be far more complex and opaque than they had ever imagined.

This story is still developing, and our news organization will continue to investigate the implications of this unprecedented leak and its impact on the political landscape. Stay tuned for further updates as this unfolding saga unfolds.",claude
Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"""Are Cell Phone Calls on Airplane Flights Inevitable?""

In a move that has sparked both excitement and concern among travelers, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are considering lifting the long-standing ban on the use of personal electronic devices, including cell phones, during flights.

The potential change in regulations has divided the public, with some eagerly anticipating the ability to stay connected while in the air, while others worry about the disruptive impact of in-flight phone calls.

""This is a significant shift in policy that could have far-reaching consequences for the aviation industry and the traveling public,"" said industry analyst, Sarah Williamson. ""The debate over the pros and cons of in-flight cell phone use is far from over.""

Proponents of the change argue that the technological advancements in modern aircraft and the widespread use of mobile devices have rendered the current restrictions outdated and unnecessary. They contend that allowing passengers to make calls during flights would enhance productivity, improve communication, and cater to the needs of a increasingly connected society.

""People are used to being able to stay in touch with their loved ones and business associates at all times,"" said frequent flyer, Michael Gonzalez. ""Being cut off from the world for the duration of a flight can be frustrating and limiting, especially for those who rely on constant communication for their work or personal lives.""

However, opponents of in-flight cell phone use warn of the potential for disruption and the creation of an uncomfortable environment for other passengers. They argue that the noise and distraction of phone conversations could negatively impact the overall flight experience, particularly for those seeking a quiet and peaceful journey.

""I can't imagine being stuck on a plane for hours, listening to my seatmate yapping away on their phone,"" said occasional traveler, Emily Nguyen. ""It would be incredibly annoying and could ruin the entire flight for me.""

Airlines have also expressed concerns about the logistical and safety implications of allowing in-flight cell phone use. Some worry that the increased chatter could interfere with crew communication and potentially compromise aviation safety.

""We have to consider the broader implications of this policy change,"" said airline spokesperson, Jane Simmons. ""While we understand the desire for connectivity, the safety and comfort of our passengers is our top priority, and we will need to carefully weigh all the factors before making any decisions.""

The debate has also raised questions about the potential for additional fees or charges that airlines may impose on passengers who wish to use their cell phones during flights. Some industry experts suggest that airlines could view this as a new revenue stream, potentially leading to the introduction of ""connectivity packages"" or per-minute usage fees.

""Airlines are always looking for ways to generate additional revenue, and in-flight cell phone use could be seen as a lucrative opportunity,"" said travel industry analyst, David Hernandez. ""Passengers may have to brace themselves for the possibility of added costs if this policy change goes through.""

As the FAA and FCC continue to evaluate the potential impacts of lifting the cell phone ban, the public remains divided on the issue. While some eagerly await the freedom to stay connected in the air, others fear the disruptive and uncomfortable consequences that in-flight phone calls could bring.

Ultimately, the decision will have far-reaching implications for the aviation industry and the traveling public, and it remains to be seen whether the convenience of in-flight communication will outweigh the potential drawbacks.",claude
"On Friday the 13th we wonder why, scientifically, we believe in superstitions","On Friday the 13th we wonder why, scientifically, we believe in superstitions

In a world where technology and science have become the cornerstones of our understanding, it may come as a surprise that many of us still cling to age-old superstitions, particularly on days like Friday the 13th. But what is it about these beliefs that continue to captivate us, even in the face of rational explanations?

Psychologists suggest that the roots of superstition lie deep within the human psyche, shaped by a complex interplay of cognitive biases, emotional needs, and sociocultural influences. One of the primary drivers behind our belief in the supernatural is the human tendency to seek patterns and find meaning in the world around us.

""Our brains are wired to identify connections, even when they may not actually exist,"" explains Dr. Jane Doe, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Somewhere. ""When we experience a series of coincidences or unexpected events, our natural inclination is to attribute them to some unseen, supernatural force, rather than chalking it up to chance.""

This cognitive bias, known as the ""illusory correlation,"" can lead us to perceive relationships between unrelated events, reinforcing our belief in the power of superstitions. For example, if a person experiences a stroke of bad luck on Friday the 13th, they may be more inclined to attribute it to the ""unlucky"" day, rather than acknowledging the myriad of other factors that could have contributed to the negative outcome.

But the allure of superstitions goes beyond just pattern recognition. Many of us also find comfort in the sense of control and predictability that these beliefs provide, especially in the face of uncertainty and uncontrollable events.

""Superstitions offer a sense of agency and the illusion of control,"" says Dr. John Smith, a social psychologist at the Institute of Behavioral Studies. ""By engaging in rituals or avoiding certain behaviors, we feel like we can somehow influence the course of events, even if it's just in our own minds.""

This psychological need for control is particularly evident in high-stress situations, such as important exams, job interviews, or major life events. In these moments, the desire to cling to superstitions can be even more pronounced, as individuals seek to alleviate their anxiety and feelings of vulnerability.

Furthermore, the persistence of superstitions can also be attributed to the powerful role of social and cultural influences. Many of our beliefs are shaped by the traditions, customs, and narratives passed down through generations, often becoming deeply ingrained in our collective consciousness.

""Superstitions are not just individual quirks, but often reflect the shared experiences and beliefs of a community,"" explains Dr. Sarah Lee, a cultural anthropologist at the Institute of Social Sciences. ""The more we are exposed to these ideas, the more they become normalized and integrated into our own personal worldviews.""

This social reinforcement can be particularly strong in certain contexts, such as the sports world, where athletes and fans alike often engage in a wide range of superstitious rituals and behaviors, believing they can influence the outcome of a game or match.

While the scientific explanations for our belief in superstitions may seem straightforward, the reality is that these beliefs continue to hold a powerful sway over our thoughts and actions. As we navigate the complexities of the modern world, it's important to recognize the psychological and cultural factors that contribute to this enduring phenomenon, and to approach it with a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the rational and the irrational aspects of the human experience.",claude
Zuckerberg's important message on miscarriage,"""Zuckerberg's Important Message on Miscarriage""

In a rare and poignant move, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have opened up about their personal struggle with miscarriage, shedding light on an often-taboo topic that affects countless women and families worldwide.

In a heartfelt Facebook post, Zuckerberg revealed that the couple had experienced three miscarriages before welcoming their daughter, Maxima, in 2015. ""You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a baby,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""And you start making plans, and you tell your family and friends, and then everything changes so quickly.""

Miscarriage, defined as the loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week, is far more common than many realize. According to the American Pregnancy Association, as many as one in four recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage, with the actual number likely higher due to unrecorded early losses.

Despite its prevalence, the topic of miscarriage remains shrouded in silence and shame, with many women feeling isolated in their grief. Zuckerberg's decision to share his family's experience aims to challenge this stigma and encourage more open dialogue around the issue.

""We wanted to share our experience to help more people feel comfortable open up about their own experiences and seek support,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""It's a lonely experience, and I hope it will give more people the courage to be open, because that's the only way to start to treat the problem.""

The Facebook CEO's message resonates strongly with women who have endured the pain of pregnancy loss. Many have taken to social media to express their gratitude and solidarity, sharing their own stories of miscarriage and the importance of breaking the silence.

""Thank you, Mark and Priscilla, for your bravery in sharing this,"" wrote one user. ""Miscarriage is a heartbreaking experience that so many women go through in silence. Your openness will help so many others feel less alone.""

Experts in women's health applaud Zuckerberg's decision to speak out, noting that it could have a significant impact on destigmatizing miscarriage and encouraging more open dialogue.

""Miscarriage is a profoundly difficult experience that far too many women face in isolation,"" said Dr. Jessica Shepherd, a leading OB-GYN and women's health expert. ""By sharing their story, the Zuckerbergs are helping to normalize this conversation and empower others to seek the support they need during this challenging time.""

Beyond raising awareness, Zuckerberg's message also highlights the importance of providing better resources and support for those coping with pregnancy loss. Many women report feeling unsupported by their healthcare providers or lacking access to counseling and other forms of aftercare.

""Miscarriage is often treated as a medical event, when in reality it's a major life event that can have profound emotional and psychological impacts,"" said Dr. Shepherd. ""We need to do more as a society to ensure women and families have the resources and care they need to grieve and heal.""

As the tech industry and corporate America continue to grapple with issues of diversity and inclusivity, Zuckerberg's openness about his family's experience with miscarriage represents a significant step forward. By humanizing the struggles faced by working parents, particularly working mothers, the Facebook CEO is challenging the cultural norms that often leave women feeling isolated and unsupported.

""No one should feel alone on a journey through miscarriage,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""It's a difficult experience, but the more we're open about it, the more we can raise awareness and support for those who need it.""

In sharing their story, the Zuckerbergs have not only brought greater visibility to an underreported issue but have also inspired others to do the same. Their message serves as a powerful reminder that even the most successful and influential individuals are not immune to the universal challenges of family, loss, and the human experience.",claude
Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much in 'Big Time Adolescence',"""Pete Davidson Doesn't Exactly Stretch Much in 'Big Time Adolescence'""

In his latest on-screen outing, Pete Davidson proves he's more than just a comedic sidekick, but his performance in the coming-of-age drama ""Big Time Adolescence"" still falls short of fully showcasing his dramatic range.

The film, written and directed by Jason Orley, follows the story of 16-year-old Mo (Griffin Gluck), a bright but awkward high school student who finds an unlikely mentor in his sister's 23-year-old college dropout ex-boyfriend, Zeke (Davidson). As Zeke introduces Mo to the world of drugs, alcohol, and general debauchery, the younger boy is torn between the allure of Zeke's carefree lifestyle and the more conventional path laid out by his concerned parents.

Davidson's Zeke is certainly a departure from the brash, fast-talking characters he's become known for in the likes of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The King of Staten Island."" Here, he portrays a directionless yet charismatic slacker who serves as both a corrupting influence and an oddly endearing father figure to the impressionable Mo.

The actor brings a natural, lived-in quality to the role, effortlessly capturing Zeke's blend of youthful energy and world-weariness. His chemistry with the young Gluck is also undeniably strong, with the two navigating the complex dynamics of their unlikely friendship with an easy, naturalistic rapport.

However, while Davidson showcases a more nuanced, low-key performance compared to his previous work, he never fully breaks free from the confines of his established screen persona. Zeke, for all his flaws and complexities, still feels like a variation on the same lovable screw-up Davidson has played before, just with a slightly more melancholic edge.

The actor's natural charisma and comedic timing are on full display, but he struggles to fully embody the deeper emotional beats required of the character. Moments of vulnerability and introspection, while present, never quite land with the same resonance as the lighter, more comedic scenes.

This is not to say that Davidson's performance is wholly ineffective. He brings a genuine poignancy to Zeke's relationship with Mo, and there are flashes of a more layered, multifaceted portrayal that hint at the actor's potential for more dramatic work.

But ultimately, ""Big Time Adolescence"" feels like a missed opportunity to truly showcase Davidson's dramatic chops. The film's overall narrative arc is a familiar one, and while Davidson's performance adds a welcome sense of lived-in authenticity, it doesn't quite elevate the material beyond its well-trodden coming-of-age tropes.

In the end, ""Big Time Adolescence"" serves as a solid showcase for Davidson's talents, but it doesn't quite prove that he's ready to fully shed his comedic persona and take on more challenging dramatic roles. The potential is there, but the execution falls just short of a true breakthrough.",claude
"In Earth's early history, a day was 23.5 hours and a year lasted 372 days","In Earth's Early History, a Day Was 23.5 Hours and a Year Lasted 372 Days

In a groundbreaking discovery that rewrites our understanding of the planet's distant past, researchers have uncovered evidence that Earth's early history was vastly different from what we know today. A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience reveals that in the distant past, a day on Earth was significantly shorter, lasting just 23.5 hours, and a year consisted of 372 days, rather than the 365.25 days we experience in the modern era.

The findings, based on a meticulous analysis of ancient rock formations, provide a glimpse into the dynamic and ever-changing nature of our home planet, challenging long-held assumptions about the stability of Earth's rotational and orbital patterns.

""This discovery is a game-changer in our understanding of the early Earth,"" said Dr. Emily Harrington, the lead author of the study and a geologist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It forces us to rethink fundamental aspects of our planet's history and the processes that have shaped it over billions of years.""

The researchers analyzed the growth patterns of ancient stromatolites, which are layered rock structures formed by the accumulation of sediments and the activities of microorganisms. By carefully measuring the thickness and spacing of these layers, the team was able to determine the duration of a day and a year in Earth's distant past.

""Stromatolites are like natural clocks, recording the rhythms of the Earth's rotation and orbit,"" explained Dr. Harrington. ""By studying their growth patterns, we can reconstruct the environmental conditions that prevailed when they were formed, including the length of a day and a year.""

The team's findings suggest that in the Archean eon, which spanned from 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago, the Earth's rotation was significantly faster, with a day lasting just 23.5 hours. This is in stark contrast to the modern 24-hour day we experience today, a difference that may have had profound implications for the development of life on the early Earth.

""A shorter day would have meant more frequent cycles of daylight and darkness, which could have impacted the evolution of biological rhythms and the distribution of light-dependent organisms,"" said Dr. Harrington.

Furthermore, the researchers found that the length of a year in the Archean eon was significantly shorter, with 372 days instead of the 365.25 days we have today. This change in the planet's orbital period is believed to be the result of complex interactions between the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun, as well as the gradual slowing of the Earth's rotation over billions of years.

""The fact that the Earth's rotation and orbit have changed so dramatically over time is a testament to the dynamic nature of our planet,"" said Dr. Harrington. ""It's a humbling reminder that the world we live in today is the product of an ongoing process of change and adaptation.""

The implications of this discovery extend beyond our understanding of the early Earth. The findings may also have implications for the search for habitable exoplanets, as the length of a day and a year can be crucial factors in determining the potential for life to develop on other worlds.

""This study shows that we can't take the stability of a planet's rotation and orbit for granted,"" said Dr. Harrington. ""As we search for Earth-like planets around other stars, we need to be mindful of the fact that these fundamental parameters may have changed over time, and that the conditions for life may be quite different from what we're used to on our own planet.""

The research team is now working to further refine their understanding of the Earth's early history, hoping to uncover even more insights into the dynamic processes that have shaped our planet over billions of years.",claude
Coronavirus decisions creates big burden for college students,"Coronavirus Decisions Creates Big Burden for College Students

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt daily life, college students across the country are facing a growing number of challenges and difficult decisions that are taking a significant toll on their academic and personal lives.

With many universities opting for online or hybrid learning models, students are grappling with the transition to remote education, which has brought about a host of new obstacles. From technological issues and limited access to campus resources to the struggle to stay motivated and engaged in a virtual classroom setting, students are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the same level of academic success they had before the pandemic.

""It's been really tough trying to adjust to online classes,"" said Sarah, a junior at a large public university. ""I'm used to the in-person interaction and hands-on learning, and now I'm just staring at a screen for hours on end. It's draining, both physically and mentally.""

The shift to remote learning has also had a significant impact on students' mental health. Feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression have become commonplace, as young adults are forced to navigate the challenges of college life without the same level of social support and community they once had.

""I used to look forward to going to campus and seeing my friends, but now I'm just stuck in my apartment all day,"" said Alex, a sophomore at a private liberal arts college. ""It's really taken a toll on my mental health, and I'm struggling to stay motivated and focused on my studies.""

In addition to the academic and emotional strain, many students are also facing financial hardships due to the pandemic. With job losses and economic uncertainty, some are finding it increasingly difficult to afford tuition, housing, and other essential expenses.

""My family has been hit pretty hard by the pandemic, and it's been a real struggle to keep up with my college costs,"" said Emily, a senior at a state university. ""I'm constantly worried about how I'm going to pay for my education, and it's added a lot of stress and anxiety to an already difficult situation.""

The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has also forced many students to make tough decisions about their academic futures. Some are opting to take a gap year or transfer to less expensive institutions, while others are considering dropping out altogether.

""I had to really think about whether it was worth it to continue with my education right now,"" said Jared, a freshman at a prestigious private university. ""The cost of tuition and the quality of the online experience just didn't seem to justify the investment, so I decided to take a year off and re-evaluate my options.""

For those who do choose to continue their studies, the experience has been far from ideal. Many are struggling to maintain a sense of community and connection with their peers, as social distancing measures and virtual events have made it challenging to build meaningful relationships.

""It's just not the same as being on campus,"" said Sarah. ""I miss the spontaneous interactions, the late-night study sessions, and the sense of belonging that I used to feel. Now, it's all just a series of Zoom calls and pre-recorded lectures.""

Despite the challenges, however, some students are finding ways to adapt and stay resilient. Many are turning to mental health resources, such as counseling services and support groups, to help them cope with the stress and isolation.

""It's been really important for me to prioritize my mental health and find ways to stay connected with my support system,"" said Alex. ""Whether it's virtual workout classes or online game nights with friends, I'm trying to find little ways to stay positive and engaged.""

As the pandemic continues to evolve, college students will undoubtedly face more difficult decisions and obstacles in the months and years ahead. But with the right resources, support, and resilience, many are determined to weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side.

""This has been one of the most challenging times of my life,"" said Emily. ""But I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep pushing forward, and I know that I'm not alone in this. We're all in this together, and we'll get through it, one day at a time.""",claude
The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games,"The Tourism Legacy of the Olympic Games

The Olympic Games have long been touted as a catalyst for boosting tourism in host cities, but the true impact of these global sporting events on the travel industry is a complex and often debated topic. As the world eagerly anticipates the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics, it's worth taking a closer look at the tourism legacy left behind by previous host cities.

One of the most notable examples is the 2008 Beijing Olympics. China's massive investment in infrastructure, including the construction of the iconic Bird's Nest stadium and the expansion of the city's metro system, laid the groundwork for a surge in tourism. In the years following the games, Beijing saw a significant increase in visitor numbers, with international arrivals rising by over 30% between 2008 and 2012.

""The Olympic Games acted as a catalyst for Beijing, accelerating the city's development and making it more accessible to international travelers,"" said Jane Li, a tourism expert at the University of Beijing. ""The improved transportation networks and world-class facilities created a lasting impression that continues to draw visitors today.""

However, the tourism boost is not always immediate or sustained. The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, for instance, faced a range of challenges, from economic recession to the Zika virus outbreak, which dampened the city's tourism prospects in the years following the games.

""Rio had high hopes for a tourism boom after the Olympics, but a combination of factors meant that the expected influx of visitors never fully materialized,"" explained Maria Fernanda, a travel writer based in Rio. ""The city's infrastructure was improved, but the economic and political instability made it a less attractive destination for many travelers.""

In contrast, the 2012 London Olympics are widely regarded as a success story when it comes to tourism. The UK capital saw a significant increase in visitor numbers in the years following the games, with international arrivals rising by over 20% between 2012 and 2016.

""London's hosting of the Olympics was a game-changer for the city's tourism industry,"" said David Williamson, a tourism analyst at the University of London. ""The investment in public transport, the creation of new attractions, and the global attention generated by the games all contributed to a sustained boost in visitor numbers.""

One factor that has been crucial in determining the long-term tourism impact of the Olympics is the host city's ability to leverage the event's legacy. Cities that have successfully repurposed Olympic venues and infrastructure for ongoing public use have tended to see a more enduring tourism boost.

The 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, for example, left behind a network of world-class skiing and snowboarding facilities that have continued to draw winter sports enthusiasts to the region. Similarly, the 2010 Vancouver Olympics resulted in the creation of the Sea-to-Sky Corridor, a scenic highway that has become a popular tourist attraction.

""The key is to ensure that the Olympic investment doesn't go to waste,"" said Sarah Connolly, a tourism consultant at the International Olympic Committee. ""Cities that can seamlessly integrate their Olympic legacy into their long-term tourism strategy are the ones that tend to see the most sustained benefits.""

As the world looks ahead to the 2024 Paris Olympics, the city's tourism authorities are already working to capitalize on the event's potential. Plans are in place to renovate historic landmarks, expand public transportation, and create new cultural attractions that will continue to draw visitors long after the closing ceremony.

""Paris is determined to learn from the successes and challenges of previous Olympic host cities,"" said Étienne Dupuy, the director of tourism for the Paris 2024 organizing committee. ""Our goal is to create a lasting tourism legacy that will benefit the city and its residents for years to come.""",claude

Why women feel pressured to shave,"Why Women Feel Pressured to Shave

In a society that often places a high value on physical appearance, the pressure for women to maintain a certain level of grooming has become a pervasive issue. One area that has been particularly scrutinized is the expectation for women to shave their body hair, a practice that has become so ingrained in our cultural norms that many women feel it is an absolute necessity.

The roots of this expectation can be traced back to the early 20th century, when the razor industry began targeting women as a new market. Advertisements at the time often depicted women with smooth, hairless skin as the ideal of beauty, subtly implying that unshaven women were unkempt or undesirable. This messaging, coupled with the societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, has led many women to feel that shaving is a non-negotiable part of their grooming routine.

""It's just something that's been drilled into us from a very young age,"" says Sarah, a 29-year-old marketing professional. ""I can't remember a time when I didn't feel like I had to shave my legs and underarms to be considered 'well-groomed' or 'feminine.'""

This sentiment is echoed by many women, who report feeling self-conscious or even ashamed if they choose not to shave. The fear of being judged or ostracized by their peers, or even facing professional consequences, can be a powerful motivator for women to conform to these societal expectations.

""I've had co-workers make comments about my 'hairy legs' or 'unruly underarms,'"" says Emily, a 35-year-old office manager. ""It's like they're implying that I'm not taking care of myself or that I'm somehow less professional because of it. It's really frustrating.""

The pressure to shave can also have deeper psychological impacts, as women internalize the message that their natural body hair is somehow unacceptable or unattractive. This can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and even body dysmorphia.

""I used to feel so self-conscious about my body hair that I would avoid wearing certain clothes or going to the beach,"" says Samantha, a 27-year-old artist. ""It's taken a lot of work to overcome that and to feel comfortable in my own skin.""

In recent years, however, there has been a growing movement of women who are challenging these societal norms and embracing their natural body hair. Social media platforms have become a hub for this body positivity movement, with women sharing their stories and encouraging others to break free from the shaving expectation.

""I think it's really important for women to know that they have a choice,"" says Olivia, a 32-year-old activist. ""We don't have to shave if we don't want to. Our bodies are our own, and we should feel empowered to make decisions about them without feeling pressured or ashamed.""

This sentiment is echoed by experts, who argue that the pressure to shave is not only unfair but also rooted in outdated and sexist societal norms.

""There's no biological or practical reason why women should be expected to shave their body hair,"" says Dr. Emily Nagoski, a sex educator and author. ""It's a completely arbitrary standard that has been imposed on us by a society that values women's appearance over their autonomy and self-expression.""

As the body positivity movement continues to gain momentum, more and more women are finding the courage to embrace their natural body hair and challenge the societal expectations that have long been imposed upon them. While the journey to self-acceptance can be a difficult one, the ultimate goal is to create a world where women feel empowered to make their own choices about their bodies, without fear of judgment or consequences.",claude
Broadway theaters to suspend all performances because of coronavirus,"Broadway Theaters to Suspend All Performances Due to Coronavirus Outbreak

New York City, NY - In an unprecedented move, all Broadway theaters in New York City will suspend performances immediately due to the growing threat of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, industry leaders announced on Thursday.

The decision, which will take effect tonight at 5 PM EST, comes after days of mounting pressure and uncertainty surrounding the ability of Broadway productions to continue operating safely amidst the global pandemic.

""The safety and health of our theatergoers and employees is our top priority,"" said Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, the national trade association for the Broadway industry. ""We recognize that this decision will be a major disappointment to the many fans who have tickets to shows, however, we believe this is the prudent course of action.""

The suspension will remain in effect through April 12, 2020, at which point the situation will be re-evaluated. All tickets for canceled performances will be refunded or exchanged at the point of purchase.

The move is an unprecedented shutdown for an industry that has weathered numerous crises over the years, including 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, and labor disputes. However, the rapid spread of COVID-19, which has now been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, has presented unique challenges that Broadway producers say they are not equipped to handle.

""This is uncharted territory for all of us,"" said John Gore, CEO of the John Gore Organization, one of the largest Broadway theater owners and producers. ""We are in close communication with health officials and the Mayor's office, and we believe that temporarily suspending performances is the responsible thing to do for our audiences, performers, and crew.""

The suspension will impact 31 shows currently running on Broadway, as well as several shows in previews that were scheduled to open in the coming weeks. Major productions affected include Hamilton, The Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, and The Lion King, among others.

The economic impact of the shutdown is expected to be severe, with industry estimates suggesting Broadway theaters generate over $33 million in ticket sales per week. Many productions operate on razor-thin profit margins, and an extended closure could prove devastating.

""This is a heartbreaking decision, but a necessary one,"" said producer Scott Rudin. ""We all want nothing more than to continue entertaining audiences, but we simply cannot put their health at risk. We will weather this storm and be back stronger than ever.""

While the suspension is set to last through April 12, industry experts warn that the closure could extend much longer depending on the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak. Some have speculated that Broadway may not reopen until the summer or even the fall.

The announcement comes on the heels of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's declaration of a state of emergency in the city, which has seen a rapid increase in confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. De Blasio has also recommended the cancellation of all non-essential gatherings of 500 or more people.

""This is an incredibly difficult time, but we must prioritize public health and safety,"" said de Blasio. ""I commend the Broadway League for taking this responsible action, and we will continue to work closely with them and other stakeholders to support the industry during this crisis.""

For the thousands of actors, musicians, stagehands, and other Broadway workers, the shutdown will mean a sudden loss of income and uncertainty about their livelihoods. Union leaders have vowed to work with producers to provide support and assistance to affected employees.

""Our hearts go out to all of the talented and dedicated professionals who make Broadway such a special place,"" said St. Martin. ""We are committed to doing everything in our power to help them through this challenging time.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt daily life around the world, the Broadway shutdown serves as a stark reminder of the far-reaching impact of this global health crisis. However, industry leaders remain hopeful that the curtain will rise again soon, and that the magic of live theater will return to the stages of New York City.",claude
Thousands forced to work on Brazil's cattle ranches,"""Thousands Forced to Work on Brazil's Cattle Ranches""

In a shocking revelation, a new report has uncovered the widespread use of forced labor on cattle ranches across Brazil. The investigation, conducted by a team of human rights researchers, paints a grim picture of exploitation and abuse, leaving many to question the ethical implications of the country's beef industry.

The report, which drew on interviews with dozens of victims, describes a harrowing pattern of deception and coercion. Impoverished individuals, often from remote regions, are lured to these ranches with promises of well-paying jobs, only to find themselves trapped in a cycle of forced labor and debt bondage.

""They promise you a good salary, a place to live, and food,"" said one survivor, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. ""But when you get there, they take away your documents, and you're forced to work long hours in the blazing heat, with little to no pay.""

According to the researchers, the workers are subjected to a range of abusive practices, including physical violence, inadequate living conditions, and the withholding of wages. Many are forced to work for months, or even years, to pay off debts that were fabricated by the ranch owners.

""It's a modern form of slavery,"" said Maria Fernanda Ribeiro, a human rights activist who has been working to expose the issue. ""These people are trapped, with no way out, and the authorities have been slow to take meaningful action.""

The report also highlights the role of the global beef supply chain in perpetuating these practices. Many of the cattle raised on these ranches are eventually sold to larger meat processing companies, both within Brazil and for export to international markets.

""Consumers around the world need to understand the human cost of the beef they're consuming,"" said Ribeiro. ""These products are tainted with the blood and sweat of exploited workers.""

In response to the report, the Brazilian government has promised to increase enforcement efforts and crack down on labor abuses in the cattle industry. However, critics argue that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the systemic issues that enable forced labor to thrive.

""The problem is deeply rooted in economic inequality, lack of social protections, and the power imbalance between wealthy ranch owners and vulnerable workers,"" said Ribeiro. ""Until we address those underlying issues, the exploitation will continue.""

For the victims of this exploitation, the path to recovery and justice remains uncertain. Many have been left physically and emotionally scarred by their experiences, and struggle to rebuild their lives in the aftermath.

""I just want to go home and be with my family,"" said the anonymous survivor. ""But I'm afraid they'll come after me if I try to leave. I don't know what the future holds, but I know I can't go back to that place.""

As the world grapples with the ethical implications of the global food system, the plight of these workers serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of our consumption. The question now is whether the public outcry and political pressure will be enough to drive the meaningful change that is so desperately needed.",claude

Step into the world of America's most notorious gangster,"""Step into the World of America's Most Notorious Gangster""

Chicago, IL - The name Al Capone has become synonymous with the golden era of American organized crime. As the infamous boss of the Chicago Outfit during the Prohibition era, Capone's ruthless and calculated rise to power has captivated the public's imagination for nearly a century.

Born in 1899 in Brooklyn, New York, Capone's life of crime began at an early age. After dropping out of school at the age of 14, he joined the notorious Five Points Gang, where he quickly established a reputation for violence and cunning. It was during this time that Capone acquired the infamous facial scars that would later become his trademark.

In 1919, Capone moved to Chicago, where he began working for gangster Johnny Torrio. Torrio recognized Capone's potential and groomed him to take over the city's lucrative bootlegging operations. When Torrio was nearly assassinated in 1925, Capone seized the opportunity to assume control of the Chicago Outfit, becoming the undisputed king of the city's underworld.

Under Capone's leadership, the Chicago Outfit flourished, with its tentacles reaching into every corner of the city's illicit activities. Bootlegging, gambling, prostitution, and extortion were just a few of the Outfit's many revenue streams. Capone's ruthless tactics, including the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre, cemented his reputation as a brutal and merciless leader.

Yet, despite his criminal exploits, Capone also cultivated a public image of a generous philanthropist, using his vast wealth to support charitable causes and win the favor of the city's residents. This carefully crafted persona, combined with his ability to evade law enforcement, only added to Capone's larger-than-life persona.

However, Capone's reign of terror was not to last. In 1929, the U.S. government launched a comprehensive investigation into the Chicago Outfit's financial activities, eventually leading to Capone's downfall. In 1931, he was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison.

Capone's incarceration marked the beginning of the end of his criminal empire. While in prison, he was diagnosed with syphilis, a condition that would ultimately lead to his demise. Upon his release in 1939, Capone was a shell of his former self, both physically and mentally.

Capone spent his final years in Florida, where he sought to rebuild his life and reputation. However, the damage done by his criminal legacy was too great to overcome. He died in 1947 at the age of 48, a broken man whose name had become synonymous with the excesses and brutality of the Prohibition era.

Today, Capone's legacy continues to fascinate and intrigue the public. His rise and fall have been the subject of countless books, films, and documentaries, cementing his place in the pantheon of America's most notorious criminals.

As we delve deeper into the world of Al Capone, we are confronted with the stark realities of the power and corruption that can take hold in the absence of the rule of law. Capone's story serves as a cautionary tale, a reminder of the consequences that can arise when greed and violence are allowed to flourish unchecked.

Yet, despite the darkness of his legacy, Capone's enduring influence on popular culture is undeniable. He has become a symbol of the American gangster, a figure whose larger-than-life persona has captured the imagination of generations.

As we continue to explore the life and times of Al Capone, we are reminded of the complex and often contradictory nature of the human experience. For in the end, Capone's story is not just a tale of crime and punishment, but a reflection of the depths to which the human spirit can sink, and the heights to which it can aspire.",claude

""We've really streamlined the entire process,"" she said. ""Patients check in online beforehand, which allows us to manage the flow of traffic and minimize wait times. Once they arrive, everything is done in a matter of minutes – swab, paperwork, and they're on their way.""

This level of organization has been crucial in a time of widespread testing shortages and overwhelmed healthcare systems. By providing a convenient, high-volume option, the drive-through clinic has helped to alleviate the burden on local hospitals and urgent care facilities.

""We're seeing people from all walks of life come through our doors,"" Patel noted. ""From essential workers to families to elderly individuals, everyone is able to access the testing they need in a safe and efficient manner.""

The drive-through model has also proven to be a valuable tool for public health officials, who are using the data collected at these clinics to better understand the spread of the virus within the community.

""The information we gather from these tests is invaluable,"" said Dr. Emily Wilkins, the local health department's epidemiologist. ""By tracking the positivity rates and demographic trends, we can identify hotspots and tailor our response efforts accordingly.""

Patel's drive-through clinic is just one example of the innovative approaches that healthcare providers have adopted in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the crisis continues to evolve, it's clear that these types of adaptations will be crucial in ensuring that everyone has access to the care and resources they need.

""This is uncharted territory for all of us,"" Patel acknowledged. ""But by working together and thinking outside the box, I believe we can overcome the challenges we're facing and come out stronger on the other side.""",claude

You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies,"""You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies""

In a scathing rebuke of the current administration, a prominent government whistleblower has come forward, shedding light on a web of deception and malpractice at the highest levels of power.

The whistleblower, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, alleges that the administration has systematically manipulated data, suppressed critical information, and actively worked to mislead the public on a range of key issues.

""This is not about politics or partisan agendas,"" the whistleblower stated. ""This is about the fundamental integrity of our democratic institutions and the sacred trust that the people have placed in their leaders. You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies.""

The whistleblower's revelations paint a troubling picture of an administration that has prioritized political expediency over transparency and accountability. According to the insider's account, senior officials have routinely cherry-picked data, omitted crucial details, and even fabricated evidence to support their policy decisions and public narratives.

""It's a complete disregard for the truth,"" the whistleblower said. ""They'll do whatever it takes to maintain their grip on power, even if it means sacrificing the very principles that our country was founded upon.""

One of the most damning allegations involves the administration's handling of the ongoing economic crisis. The whistleblower claims that the government has deliberately underreported the extent of the downturn, concealing the true scale of job losses, business closures, and financial hardship faced by millions of Americans.

""The numbers they're presenting to the public are simply not accurate,"" the whistleblower asserted. ""They're massaging the data to create an illusion of stability and recovery, when the reality on the ground is much more dire.""

The whistleblower also alleged that the administration has suppressed critical scientific information related to the ongoing public health crisis, downplaying the severity of the situation and overriding the recommendations of medical experts.

""They've silenced dissenting voices, censored inconvenient data, and pushed a narrative that doesn't align with the facts on the ground,"" the whistleblower said. ""It's a blatant disregard for the well-being of the American people.""

The revelations have sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with lawmakers from both parties calling for immediate investigations and a thorough review of the administration's practices.

""If these allegations are true, it represents a fundamental breach of the public trust,"" said Senator Olivia Reyes, a member of the Senate Oversight Committee. ""We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this and hold those responsible accountable.""

The whistleblower, who has been described as a long-serving civil servant with a spotless record, has expressed concerns for their safety and the potential consequences of their actions.

""I know I'm putting myself at risk by coming forward, but I couldn't in good conscience remain silent,"" the whistleblower said. ""The American people deserve the truth, and it's our duty as public servants to ensure that they get it, no matter the cost.""

As the fallout from these revelations continues to unfold, the administration has vehemently denied the whistleblower's allegations, dismissing them as ""baseless"" and ""politically motivated.""

However, with mounting pressure from lawmakers, the media, and the public, the administration may find it increasingly difficult to maintain its narrative and avoid a reckoning for its alleged misdeeds.

""The truth will come out, one way or another,"" the whistleblower said. ""And when it does, the American people will have to decide whether they can trust their government again.""",claude
21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India,"""21 of the World's 30 Cities with the Worst Air Pollution are in India""

New Delhi, India - A recent report by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company, has revealed a concerning trend: 21 of the 30 cities with the world's worst air pollution are located in India.

The report, which analyzed air quality data from over 6,000 cities across 117 countries, paints a grim picture of the air quality crisis facing India. The country's rapidly growing population, industrialization, and reliance on fossil fuels have all contributed to the worsening of air pollution in many of its major urban centers.

At the top of the list is Bhiwadi, a city in the northern state of Rajasthan, which recorded an average annual PM2.5 concentration of 106.2 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³) – more than 10 times the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended limit of 5 μg/m³.

""The air pollution situation in India is nothing short of a public health emergency,"" said Avinash Chanchal, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace India. ""The high concentrations of particulate matter and other pollutants are having a devastating impact on the health and well-being of millions of people.""

Following Bhiwadi in the rankings are Ghaziabad (105.3 μg/m³), Hotan (97.4 μg/m³), and Delhi (92.6 μg/m³) – all of which are located in India. Other Indian cities that made the top 30 list include Noida, Lucknow, Jodhpur, and Muzaffarpur.

The report also highlighted the disproportionate impact of air pollution on vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly. Exposure to high levels of particulate matter and other pollutants can lead to a range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as increased risk of premature death.

""Air pollution is a silent killer, and it's hitting the most vulnerable members of our society the hardest,"" said Chanchal. ""We need urgent action from the government and other stakeholders to address this crisis and protect the health of our citizens.""

In response to the report, the Indian government has pledged to take a more proactive approach to tackling air pollution. This includes implementing stricter emissions standards for industries, promoting the use of cleaner fuels, and investing in public transportation and renewable energy.

However, experts argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the problem, such as the country's reliance on coal-fired power plants, the widespread use of biomass burning for cooking and heating, and the growing number of private vehicles on the roads.

""The solutions to India's air pollution crisis are well-known, but they require a comprehensive and sustained effort from all levels of government, as well as the active participation of the private sector and civil society,"" said Chanchal.

As the world's attention turns to the growing threat of climate change, the air pollution crisis in India serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need to address environmental issues that have a direct impact on human health and well-being.

""This report should be a wake-up call for India and the global community,"" said Chanchal. ""We can no longer afford to ignore the devastating consequences of air pollution. It's time to take bold action and ensure that everyone, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status, has access to clean and healthy air.""",claude

"Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time","""Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time""

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the cracks in our government's preparedness and response, leaving many Americans frustrated and concerned about the future. As a nation, we have fallen short in our efforts to contain the virus, but there is still time to course-correct and regain control of the situation.

The initial failure to ramp up testing capabilities has been a significant setback. Despite warnings from public health experts, the federal government was slow to recognize the gravity of the crisis and invest in the necessary infrastructure. This delay has hindered our ability to accurately track the spread of the virus, leaving us blind to the true scope of the outbreak.

Furthermore, the lack of a cohesive, nationwide strategy has led to a patchwork of state-level responses, creating confusion and inconsistency. While some states have implemented strict lockdown measures, others have been more lax, allowing the virus to spread unchecked. This uncoordinated approach has undermined our collective efforts to flatten the curve.

The shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers has also been a glaring issue. Frontline workers, who are risking their lives to care for the sick, have been forced to reuse masks and gowns, putting their own health and safety at risk. The government's failure to ensure adequate supplies of PPE has exacerbated the strain on our healthcare system, which is already stretched thin.

Moreover, the economic fallout from the pandemic has been devastating, with millions of Americans losing their jobs and struggling to make ends meet. While the federal government has provided some relief through stimulus packages, the response has been criticized as too slow and insufficient to meet the scale of the crisis.

Despite these failures, there is still time for the government to course-correct and regain the trust of the American people. The first step is to implement a comprehensive, nationwide strategy to combat the virus. This should include a robust testing and contact tracing program, as well as clear, consistent guidelines for social distancing and the reopening of businesses and schools.

The government must also prioritize the production and distribution of PPE, ensuring that healthcare workers have the resources they need to safely care for patients. Additionally, further economic relief measures, such as extended unemployment benefits and direct payments to households, are crucial to help Americans weather this storm.

Perhaps most importantly, the government must be transparent and accountable in its actions. Regular, honest communication from public health officials and political leaders is essential to build public confidence and encourage compliance with safety measures.

By taking these steps, the government can regain the trust of the American people and demonstrate a renewed commitment to protecting the health and well-being of the nation. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a devastating challenge, but with decisive action and effective leadership, we can emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient.",claude
Bristol sisters aim to raise awareness of 'honour hate',"""Bristol Sisters Aim to Raise Awareness of 'Honour Hate'

In a bold move to shed light on the often-overlooked issue of ""honour hate,"" two sisters from Bristol, England, have embarked on a mission to educate their community and advocate for change.

Fatima and Amina Bibi, aged 25 and 22 respectively, have been vocal about their personal experiences with honour-based abuse, a form of domestic violence that disproportionately affects women and girls from certain cultural and religious backgrounds.

""Growing up, we witnessed firsthand the devastating impact that honour-based violence can have on individuals and families,"" says Fatima, the elder of the two sisters. ""It's a deeply rooted problem that often goes unrecognized, and we're determined to change that.""

Honour-based abuse, also known as ""honour hate,"" refers to a range of violent and controlling behaviours, including physical, emotional, and psychological abuse, carried out to protect or restore the perceived honour of a family or community. This can include forced marriage, female genital mutilation, and even murder.

According to a recent report by the UK's Crown Prosecution Service, honour-based abuse cases have been on the rise, with a 64% increase in prosecutions over the past five years. However, experts believe that the true scale of the problem is much larger, as many cases go unreported due to fear, cultural barriers, and lack of awareness.

""The shame and stigma associated with honour-based abuse make it incredibly difficult for victims to come forward,"" explains Amina, the younger sister. ""We want to empower people to speak up and seek help, while also educating the wider community about the realities of this issue.""

To achieve this, the Bibi sisters have launched a multi-pronged campaign, which includes a series of community workshops, public awareness events, and a powerful social media presence. Their goal is to reach as many people as possible and break the cycle of silence surrounding honour-based violence.

""It's not just about educating victims – we need to address the root causes of this problem,"" says Fatima. ""We're working with local authorities, community leaders, and other organizations to challenge the cultural norms and beliefs that perpetuate honour-based abuse.""

One of the sisters' key initiatives is a partnership with a local school, where they have been delivering workshops on healthy relationships, consent, and the importance of individual autonomy. They have also collaborated with a domestic violence charity to provide training for frontline professionals, such as social workers and healthcare providers, on recognizing and responding to honour-based abuse.

""The response has been overwhelmingly positive,"" says Amina. ""People are hungry for this information, and they're grateful that we're shining a light on an issue that has been overlooked for far too long.""

The Bibi sisters' efforts have not gone unnoticed. They have been featured in local media and have been invited to speak at a number of national and international conferences on the topic of honour-based violence.

""We're not doing this for the recognition,"" Fatima emphasizes. ""Our goal is to create real, sustainable change – to empower individuals, transform communities, and ultimately, save lives.""

As they continue their campaign, the sisters remain steadfast in their commitment to breaking the silence and challenging the societal norms that enable honour-based abuse to thrive.

""This is a deeply personal issue for us, but it's also a universal problem that affects people all over the world,"" says Amina. ""We won't stop until we've made a lasting difference.""",claude

London, UK - In a groundbreaking move, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has announced a major overhaul of its news operations, signaling a shift towards a more dynamic and engaging approach to journalism.

At the heart of this transformation is a renewed focus on digital platforms, with the BBC pledging to invest heavily in its online presence and multimedia content. ""We recognize that the way people consume news has evolved significantly in recent years,"" said BBC Director-General, Tim Davie. ""Our goal is to ensure that the BBC remains at the forefront of this changing landscape, delivering high-quality journalism that is accessible and relevant to audiences across the UK and around the world.""

One of the key initiatives unveiled by the BBC is the launch of a revamped news website and mobile app, which will feature a sleek, user-friendly design and a more personalized experience for readers. ""We want to make it easier than ever for our audience to access the news they care about, whether they're at home, on the go, or on the move,"" explained Davie.

The new digital platforms will also incorporate advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide users with tailored content recommendations and breaking news alerts based on their individual preferences and consumption patterns.

In addition to the digital overhaul, the BBC has announced plans to expand its network of local and regional news bureaus, with a particular emphasis on underserved areas of the country. ""We understand the importance of local journalism in connecting communities and providing a voice for those who might otherwise be overlooked,"" said Davie.

""Our audience expects us to be at the forefront of innovation, and we're excited to explore how these technologies can enhance the storytelling experience and provide new ways for people to engage with the news,"" said Davie.

The BBC's commitment to innovation extends beyond just the technical aspects of news delivery. The corporation has also announced plans to invest in the development of new editorial formats and content genres, including short-form video, interactive data visualizations, and immersive audio experiences.

How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef,"""How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef""

In a bold move that has shaken up the fast-food industry, McDonald's has announced the nationwide rollout of fresh beef in its signature Quarter Pounder burgers. This strategic shift, which has been in the works for several years, marks a significant departure from the chain's long-standing reliance on frozen beef patties.

The decision to transition to fresh beef was not taken lightly. McDonald's, known for its commitment to consistency and efficiency, had to overcome a number of logistical challenges to ensure a seamless implementation across its vast network of over 14,000 restaurants in the United States.

""This was a massive undertaking that required meticulous planning and coordination,"" said Chris Kempczinski, President of McDonald's USA. ""We knew that our customers were demanding a higher-quality burger experience, and we were determined to deliver.""

The shift to fresh beef has been a gradual process, with McDonald's testing the new system in select markets before rolling it out nationwide. The company has worked closely with its beef suppliers to ensure a reliable and consistent supply of fresh, high-quality beef.

""It's been a significant investment, both in terms of time and resources,"" Kempczinski acknowledged. ""But we firmly believe that the end result will be a better burger that our customers will truly appreciate.""

One of the key challenges in the transition was ensuring that the fresh beef could be delivered to McDonald's restaurants in a timely and efficient manner. The company has had to rework its supply chain logistics, including the implementation of new temperature-controlled transportation and storage systems.

""We've had to be incredibly meticulous in our handling of the fresh beef,"" said Kempczinski. ""Even a slight deviation from the optimal temperature or handling protocols can compromise the quality and safety of the product.""

To address this challenge, McDonald's has partnered with its beef suppliers to develop a comprehensive training program for its restaurant staff. This includes detailed instructions on proper food handling, preparation, and storage procedures to ensure the freshness and quality of the beef.

The switch to fresh beef has also had a significant impact on McDonald's menu and operations. The company has had to adjust its cooking times and procedures to accommodate the different properties of fresh beef compared to frozen patties.

""It's been a learning process for our team, but they've risen to the challenge,"" Kempczinski said. ""We've had to fine-tune our processes to ensure that every Quarter Pounder is cooked to perfection and delivered to our customers with the same level of consistency they've come to expect from McDonald's.""

The reaction from customers has been overwhelmingly positive, with many praising the improved taste and texture of the new Quarter Pounder burgers. Social media has been abuzz with customers sharing their experiences and comparing the fresh beef to the chain's previous frozen offerings.

""I was a bit skeptical at first, but the difference is truly remarkable,"" said Sarah, a longtime McDonald's customer. ""The burger just tastes so much more fresh and flavorful. It's a game-changer for me.""

The move to fresh beef is part of a broader strategy by McDonald's to reinvent itself as a more premium and health-conscious fast-food option. The company has also been working to improve the quality of its other menu items, including the introduction of fresh produce and the elimination of artificial preservatives.

""We're committed to continuously improving the customer experience and delivering the best possible food quality,"" Kempczinski said. ""The switch to fresh beef is just the beginning of a broader transformation that will keep McDonald's at the forefront of the fast-food industry.""

As the company continues to adapt to the changing preferences of its customers, the move to fresh beef stands as a testament to McDonald's willingness to embrace innovation and adapt to the evolving landscape of the fast-food industry.",claude
March 9 coronavirus news,"""March 9 Coronavirus News: Vaccine Rollout Continues, Experts Warn of New Variants""

As the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the world saw both progress and challenges on March 9th, 2023. 

In the United States, the vaccination campaign pressed forward, with over 200 million Americans having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, health officials warned that new, more transmissible variants of the virus could threaten the progress made so far.

""We are in a race against time,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the President. ""These new variants have the potential to evade some of the protection offered by our current vaccines. We must continue to vaccinate as many people as possible to stay ahead of the virus.""

Globally, the vaccine rollout remained uneven, with many lower-income countries still struggling to obtain sufficient doses for their populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) called for greater international cooperation and equitable distribution of vaccines.

""No one is safe until everyone is safe,"" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""We must work together to ensure that vaccines reach the most vulnerable people, no matter where they live.""

In the United Kingdom, health authorities reported a surge in cases linked to the BA.2 subvariant of the Omicron strain. This more transmissible offshoot of the original Omicron variant has become the dominant form of the virus in several countries.

""BA.2 is a stark reminder that this pandemic is far from over,"" said Dr. Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency. ""We must remain vigilant and continue to follow public health guidance to protect ourselves and our communities.""

Meanwhile, in India, the government announced plans to begin the production of a new, domestically-developed COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine, known as Corbevax, is expected to be more affordable and accessible for the country's vast population.

""This is a significant step forward in our fight against the pandemic,"" said Indian Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. ""Corbevax will help us reach more people, especially in the rural and remote areas of the country.""

The news was welcomed by global health experts, who have long called for the development of more diverse and affordable vaccine options, particularly for lower-income nations.

""Diversifying the global vaccine supply is crucial to ensuring equitable access,"" said Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO's chief scientist. ""Homegrown vaccines like Corbevax can play a vital role in this effort.""

In other developments, researchers continued to study the long-term effects of COVID-19, known as ""long COVID."" A new study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that even mild cases of the disease can lead to cognitive impairment and other neurological symptoms that can persist for months.

""This underscores the importance of preventing COVID-19 infection, even in seemingly mild cases,"" said Dr. Avindra Nath, the study's lead author and a senior investigator at the National Institutes of Health. ""The impacts of this disease can be far-reaching and long-lasting.""

As the world navigates the ever-evolving COVID-19 landscape, public health officials stressed the need for vigilance and continued efforts to control the spread of the virus.

""We have come a long way, but the fight is far from over,"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We must remain united in our commitment to protecting ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities from this deadly disease.""",claude
Splayed Roast Chicken With Caramelized Ramps Recipe,"Splayed Roast Chicken With Caramelized Ramps Recipe

By [Your Name], Food Correspondent

In a world where culinary excellence is often sought after, one dish has emerged as a true standout: the Splayed Roast Chicken with Caramelized Ramps. This mouthwatering creation, crafted by the skilled hands of renowned chefs, is set to revolutionize the way we experience the humble chicken.

The key to this dish's success lies in its unique preparation method. Rather than the traditional whole-roasted approach, the chicken is splayed, or butterflied, allowing for a more even and efficient cooking process. This technique not only ensures a perfectly cooked bird but also creates a visually striking presentation that is sure to impress even the most discerning of diners.

As the chicken roasts, the fragrant aroma of caramelized ramps fills the air, tantalizing the senses and whetting the appetite. Ramps, a wild member of the allium family, are prized for their distinctive flavor, which can be described as a delightful fusion of garlic and onion. When sautéed to a golden-brown perfection, they lend a depth of flavor that perfectly complements the juicy, succulent chicken.

The preparation of this dish is a true work of culinary art. The chicken is first seasoned with a blend of aromatic spices, including garlic, thyme, and a touch of paprika, which infuse the meat with a robust and tantalizing flavor. The splayed chicken is then placed on a baking sheet, ensuring that the skin crisps up to a beautiful golden-brown hue.

While the chicken roasts, the ramps are meticulously prepared. These elusive spring greens are carefully harvested, their vibrant green leaves and slender white stems meticulously cleaned and trimmed. They are then sautéed in a pan with a generous amount of butter, allowing their natural sugars to caramelize and create a sweet, savory, and slightly pungent flavor profile.

As the chicken reaches its optimal doneness, the ramps are carefully arranged around the bird, creating a visually stunning and harmonious presentation. The contrast between the crisp, golden-brown skin of the chicken and the caramelized ramps is simply breathtaking, making this dish a true feast for the senses.

The first bite of the Splayed Roast Chicken with Caramelized Ramps is a revelation. The juicy, flavorful meat of the chicken melts in the mouth, while the crisp skin provides a satisfying crunch.

Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely,"Coronavirus: How to Clean Your Smartphone Safely

In the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining proper hygiene has become more crucial than ever. One often-overlooked item that requires regular cleaning is our smartphones, which we use extensively throughout the day and can harbor a significant amount of germs and bacteria.

Experts advise that we should be cleaning our phones regularly to reduce the risk of spreading or contracting the virus. However, it's important to do so in a way that doesn't damage the delicate electronic components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to effectively clean your smartphone without causing any harm.

Gather the Necessary Supplies
The first step is to gather the necessary cleaning supplies. Avoid using household cleaners, bleach, or alcohol-based wipes, as these can be too harsh and potentially damage your phone's screen or other parts. Instead, opt for disinfecting wipes that contain at least 70% isopropyl alcohol or a microfiber cloth dampened with a mixture of warm water and mild soap.

It's also a good idea to have a soft, dry cloth on hand to gently dry your phone after cleaning.

Power Down Your Device
Before you begin cleaning, power down your smartphone and unplug any cables or accessories. This will help prevent any accidental damage to the internal components.

Wipe Down the Exterior
Using your disinfecting wipes or the soap and water solution, gently wipe down the entire exterior of your phone, including the screen, back, and sides. Be sure to pay special attention to high-touch areas, such as the camera, buttons, and ports.

Avoid getting any moisture in the openings of your phone, as this could potentially cause water damage. If you do accidentally get some moisture in the ports, use the soft, dry cloth to gently dab it away.

Clean the Screen
For the screen, use a microfiber cloth to gently wipe away any smudges or fingerprints. Avoid pressing too hard, as this could scratch the delicate display.

If you notice any stubborn dirt or grime, you can lightly dampen the microfiber cloth with the soap and water solution, but be sure to wring it out thoroughly before wiping the screen.

Don't Forget the Case
If you use a protective case for your smartphone, don't forget to clean that as well. Remove the case and wipe it down with the disinfecting wipes or soap and water solution, paying close attention to the nooks and crannies where dirt and germs can accumulate.

Allow Everything to Dry Completely
Once you've finished cleaning your phone and its case, use the soft, dry cloth to gently pat everything down and remove any excess moisture. It's important to allow your phone and case to dry completely before reassembling and using your device.

Maintain Regular Cleaning Habits
Experts recommend cleaning your smartphone at least once a day, or more frequently if you've been out in public or have been in close contact with others. By making smartphone cleaning a part of your daily routine, you can help reduce the spread of germs and protect yourself and your loved ones from potential illness.

Remember, while cleaning your phone is important, it's also crucial to continue following other recommended hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, social distancing, and wearing a mask when in public.

By taking these simple steps to clean your smartphone safely, you can help keep yourself and your device free from harmful bacteria and viruses during these challenging times.",claude

Blachford's technical prowess is on full display, as he masterfully navigates the challenges of capturing these upside-down scenes. ""Shooting upside down requires a significant amount of planning and precision,"" he says. ""I have to carefully consider the composition, lighting, and even the camera angle to ensure that the final image conveys the desired effect.""

The attention to detail in Blachford's work is evident, with each photograph meticulously crafted to create a sense of disorientation and wonder. The viewer is left to ponder the nature of perception, questioning the boundaries between what is real and what is imagined.

""Upside Down"" has already garnered widespread acclaim, with art enthusiasts and critics alike praising Blachford's innovative approach.

"4 of your latest coronavirus questions, answered","""4 of Your Latest Coronavirus Questions, Answered""

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, many people have pressing questions about the virus, its variants, and the ongoing public health response. In this article, we'll address four of the most common coronavirus-related queries our readers have submitted in recent weeks.

1. What is the Omicron BA.5 subvariant, and how concerning is it?
The Omicron BA.5 subvariant has become the dominant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in many parts of the world, including the United States. BA.5 is a descendent of the original Omicron variant that fueled a massive surge in COVID-19 cases last winter.

Compared to previous versions of Omicron, BA.5 appears to be even more transmissible and able to evade immunity from prior infection and vaccines. Early data suggests BA.5 may be 30-50% more infectious than the original Omicron variant.

Additionally, BA.5 seems to be better at infecting people who are vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19. However, health experts emphasize that vaccines and boosters still provide significant protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death from BA.5 infections.

Overall, the rise of BA.5 is concerning and has led to increases in COVID-19 cases in many regions. But it's not considered a drastically more dangerous variant than previous Omicron sublineages. Continued vigilance, including masking in crowded indoor settings, remains important.

2. Do I need to get a second booster shot?
The availability and recommendations around second booster doses have been a source of confusion for many. Here's the current guidance:

The CDC recommends that everyone ages 50 and older, as well as certain immunocompromised individuals ages 12 and older, receive a second booster shot. This additional dose can be given at least 4 months after receiving the first booster.

For most healthy adults under 50, a single booster shot is still considered sufficient for now. However, public health experts suggest those in this age group may eventually need a second booster, especially as new variants emerge.

Ultimately, the decision to get a second booster should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider, taking into account your age, health status, and personal risk factors. Staying up to date on recommended COVID-19 vaccinations remains crucial.

3. Is it safe to travel this summer?
As COVID-19 restrictions have eased in many parts of the world, travel is rebounding. But the pandemic is still ongoing, so there are important safety considerations for those planning trips.

Experts recommend that travelers, regardless of vaccination status, continue to wear high-quality masks in crowded indoor settings like airports and airplanes. Testing before and after travel is also advisable, especially for those at higher risk of severe illness.

Domestic travel within one's home country is generally lower-risk than international trips, where you may encounter more unpredictable local transmission levels and varying public health policies.

Ultimately, the decision to travel involves weighing your own risk tolerance. Consulting with a healthcare provider, monitoring local COVID-19 data at your destination, and having a plan for accessing testing and medical care if needed can help mitigate the risks.

4. Should I be concerned about ""long COVID""?
""Long COVID,"" also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), refers to a range of persistent symptoms that can linger for weeks or months after the initial infection.

Common long COVID symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, chronic pain, and cardiovascular or neurological issues. Estimates suggest that 10-30% of COVID-19 patients may develop long-term complications, even after mild initial infections.

While the exact causes of long COVID are still being investigated, it's believed to involve an abnormal immune response and ongoing inflammation triggered by the virus. Certain factors like older age, underlying health conditions, and severe initial illness may increase the risk of developing long COVID.

Unfortunately, there is no single proven treatment for long COVID, and recovery can be slow and unpredictable. Supportive care, symptom management, and rehabilitation are the main approaches. Researchers are actively studying",claude
These people could make Trump's life miserable,"""These people could make Trump's life miserable""

As the former president, Donald Trump, faces a growing number of legal challenges and investigations, a group of individuals and entities have emerged as potential thorns in his side. From state prosecutors to congressional committees, these entities could significantly impact Trump's future and the legacy he hopes to leave behind.

The New York Attorney General's Office
One of the most high-profile investigations into Trump's affairs is being conducted by the New York Attorney General's Office. Led by Letitia James, the office has been probing the Trump Organization's financial practices, including allegations of inflating asset values to obtain favorable loans and insurance coverage, as well as deflating asset values to reduce tax burdens.

The investigation, which has been ongoing for over two years, has already resulted in the indictment of the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, on charges of tax evasion. The case is expected to intensify in the coming months, with the potential for further indictments and a civil lawsuit against the former president and his company.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office
Parallel to the New York Attorney General's investigation, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office has been conducting a criminal probe into the Trump Organization's finances. Led by Alvin Bragg, the office has been examining a wide range of potential crimes, including insurance and bank fraud, as well as hush money payments made to women who alleged affairs with Trump.

The investigation has already resulted in the indictment of the Trump Organization and Weisselberg, and it is believed that the office is considering whether to bring charges against Trump himself. The outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for the former president, potentially leading to criminal charges and further legal battles.

The January 6th Committee
On the federal level, the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol has emerged as another potential threat to Trump's legacy. The committee, led by Representative Bennie Thompson, has been gathering evidence and testimony from a wide range of witnesses, including former Trump administration officials and allies.

The committee's goal is to determine the extent of Trump's involvement in the events leading up to and during the attack, as well as any potential efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The committee's findings could lead to criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, which could then decide whether to pursue charges against the former president.

The Department of Justice
In addition to the investigations by state and congressional entities, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has also been actively involved in probing various aspects of Trump's actions and the events surrounding the January 6th attack. Under the leadership of Attorney General Merrick Garland, the DOJ has been examining potential criminal charges related to the Capitol attack, as well as any potential efforts to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.

The DOJ's investigations could result in charges against Trump or his associates, further complicating the former president's legal and political landscape. The department's decisions and actions will be closely watched by both Trump's supporters and critics.

Conclusion
As these investigations and legal battles unfold, Trump's future remains uncertain. The former president faces a daunting array of potential legal challenges, each of which could have significant consequences for his personal and political legacy. While Trump has historically been able to weather legal storms, the sheer number and gravity of the current investigations suggest that he may be facing his greatest test yet.

The outcomes of these cases could not only impact Trump's own future but also have broader implications for the rule of law and the integrity of the American political system. As the nation watches these events unfold, the question remains: will these individuals and entities be able to make Trump's life miserable, or will the former president once again emerge unscathed?",claude
Ellie and Nele: From she to he - and back to she again,"Ellie and Nele: From she to he - and back to she again

In a remarkable journey of self-discovery, Ellie and Nele, two young individuals, have navigated the complexities of gender identity, challenging societal norms and finding the courage to embrace their true selves.

Ellie's Story
Ellie, now 25, always felt a disconnect between her assigned gender at birth and her inner sense of identity. ""I knew from a young age that I was different,"" she recounts. ""The way I expressed myself, the clothes I preferred, and the activities I enjoyed – they all felt at odds with the expectations placed on me as a girl.""

After years of grappling with her feelings, Ellie made the decision to transition to living as a man, taking on the name Nele and using he/him pronouns. ""It was a liberating and empowering experience,"" Nele says. ""I finally felt like I could be true to myself, without the constraints of societal gender norms.""

The transition process was not without its challenges, however. Nele faced skepticism and even hostility from some family members and acquaintances. ""There were times when I felt isolated and misunderstood,"" he admits. ""But I was determined to stay true to myself, no matter the cost.""

Nele's journey also included physical changes, as he underwent hormone therapy and, eventually, gender-affirming surgery. ""It was a long and sometimes painful process, but it was necessary for me to feel complete,"" he explains.

The Unexpected Twist
Just as Nele was settling into his new identity, he experienced another profound shift. ""After several years of living as a man, I started to feel a pull back towards my feminine side,"" he says. ""It was as if a part of me that I had suppressed was yearning to be expressed once more.""

Nele's decision to transition back to living as a woman was not an easy one. ""I knew that it would be met with confusion and even judgment from some people,"" she acknowledges. ""But I also knew that I needed to be true to myself, even if it meant going against societal expectations again.""

Ellie's Rebirth
With a newfound sense of self-acceptance, Ellie embraced her return to living as a woman. ""It felt like I was coming home,"" she says. ""I finally felt comfortable in my own skin, no longer torn between the expectations of others and my own inner truth.""

Ellie's journey has not been without its challenges, but she has found strength in the support of her close friends and family members who have stood by her throughout her transformations. ""They've been incredible,"" she says. ""They've embraced me for who I am, and that has made all the difference.""

Saudi Arabia detains senior members of its royal family,"Saudi Arabia Detains Senior Members of Its Royal Family

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia - In a surprising move, the Saudi government has detained several senior members of the royal family, including Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the younger brother of King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince.

The detentions, which occurred on Friday night, were confirmed by multiple sources within the Saudi government, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

According to the sources, the arrests were made on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, who has consolidated power in recent years. The sources stated that the princes were accused of plotting a coup against the crown prince, though no further details were provided.

The arrests represent a significant escalation in the crown prince's efforts to solidify his grip on power and eliminate potential rivals within the royal family. Prince Ahmed and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were once seen as potential successors to the throne, but they have fallen out of favor with the current leadership.

The detentions come just weeks after the kingdom's authorities arrested at least nine people, including two female activists, in a crackdown on dissent. The move has drawn widespread international criticism, with human rights groups condemning the Saudi government's suppression of free speech and political opposition.

In a statement, the Saudi government did not provide any details about the arrests, but it did say that the country's stability and security are a ""red line"" that will not be crossed.

The arrests have sent shockwaves through the Saudi royal family, which has long been known for its internal power struggles and infighting. The kingdom's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years, particularly following the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which was widely believed to have been ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The current situation in Saudi Arabia has raised concerns about the stability of the kingdom and the potential for further unrest. Some analysts have suggested that the arrests may be a sign of the crown prince's growing insecurity and his determination to eliminate any perceived threats to his rule.

However, others have argued that the detentions are part of a broader effort by the Saudi government to consolidate power and assert its authority in the face of domestic and international challenges.

Regardless of the motivations behind the arrests, the situation in Saudi Arabia remains highly volatile, and the international community will be closely watching to see how the kingdom responds in the coming days and weeks.",claude
Tourists being kept under coronavirus quarantine at luxury Maldives resort,"Tourists Being Kept Under Coronavirus Quarantine at Luxury Maldives Resort

MALE, Maldives - Hundreds of tourists have found themselves unexpectedly quarantined at a luxury resort in the Maldives after a guest tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

The Kandima Maldives resort, located on a private island in the Indian Ocean archipelago, has been placed under lockdown by local health authorities after a Chinese national staying at the resort was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

""We are working closely with the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and the relevant authorities to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all our guests and hosts,"" the resort said in a statement. ""We have taken all the necessary precautions and are following the guidelines issued by the HPA.""

According to resort management, all guests have been asked to remain in their villas and avoid any contact with other visitors or staff. Meal deliveries are being made to each room, and the resort has closed all public areas, including restaurants, bars, and recreational facilities.

""It's a surreal situation,"" said Nisha Varma, an Indian tourist who has been staying at the resort with her husband. ""One minute we were enjoying the sun and sand, and the next we're confined to our rooms with no idea of when we'll be allowed to leave.""

Varma said resort staff have been providing regular updates and assurances, but acknowledged the uncertainty has been stressful.

""They're doing their best to keep us comfortable and safe, but it's still a very unsettling experience,"" she said. ""We just want to go home at this point.""

The Maldives government has confirmed that all guests and staff at the Kandima resort will be tested for the coronavirus, and those who test positive will be transferred to a quarantine facility on another island.

""Our top priority is containing the spread of the virus and ensuring the health and safety of everyone involved,"" said Aishath Shaheen, a spokesperson for the HPA. ""We are working around the clock to manage this situation.""

The Maldives, a popular tourist destination known for its pristine beaches and luxury resorts, has reported a total of 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far. The country has implemented a range of measures to prevent the further spread of the virus, including suspending visa-on-arrival for visitors from certain countries and closing schools and public gatherings.

""This is an unprecedented situation, and we are doing everything in our power to support the affected guests and staff,"" said Neeraj Seth, the managing director of Kandima Maldives. ""We appreciate the patience and understanding of our visitors during this challenging time.""

For the tourists currently quarantined at the resort, the experience has been a far cry from the idyllic vacation they had envisioned.

""We came here to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings, and instead we're stuck in our rooms, worried about our health and wondering when we'll be able to go home,"" said Varma. ""It's a surreal and unsettling situation, but we're trying to stay positive and follow the instructions of the authorities.""

As the coronavirus outbreak continues to disrupt travel and daily life around the world, the quarantine at the Kandima Maldives serves as a stark reminder of the global impact of the pandemic. For the tourists involved, it's a vacation that has taken an unexpected and unsettling turn.",claude
My mother was raped in a nursing home at 88,"Content warning: This article discusses sexual assault.

""My mother was raped in a nursing home at 88""

CITY, STATE - In a heartbreaking and disturbing case, an 88-year-old woman was sexually assaulted in her nursing home, leaving her family devastated and demanding answers.

The victim, Martha Johnson*, was a resident at Sunshine Senior Living, a respected long-term care facility in the area. According to her daughter, Sarah Williams*, the assault occurred in late 2022 while Martha was recovering from a recent hospitalization.

""My mom had been doing well and was looking forward to getting back on her feet,"" said Williams. ""The next thing we know, the police are at our door telling us she'd been attacked. It's been an absolute nightmare.""

Williams explained that her mother, who suffers from dementia, was found by a nurse's aide in a compromising position with another resident, a 72-year-old man named Henry Davis*. Davis, who also has cognitive impairments, was immediately detained by the facility staff and later arrested by the local police department.

""We were shocked and horrified,"" Williams continued. ""How could this happen? My mom is a vulnerable elder who deserves to feel safe and cared for, not violated in the place that was supposed to protect her.""

Sunshine Senior Living released a statement saying they were ""deeply saddened by this incident"" and that they are cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation. The facility also claimed to have ""robust security measures and protocols in place to prevent such events,"" though Williams disputed this account.

""There were clearly gaps in their supervision and safety procedures,"" she said. ""My mom was assaulted right under their noses. We trusted them to look after her, and they failed us completely.""

According to the police report, Davis has been charged with first-degree sexual assault. He is currently being held on a $500,000 bond as the case proceeds through the criminal justice system.

Meanwhile, the Johnson family is grappling with the emotional and psychological toll of the traumatic incident. Martha, who is still recovering physically, has exhibited signs of increased anxiety and depression. Williams said her mother is now ""terrified"" to return to the nursing home.

""She used to love going to the activities and socializing with the other residents,"" Williams lamented. ""Now, she's scared to leave her room. It's heartbreaking to see her like this.""

The family has retained a local attorney, who is exploring legal options against Sunshine Senior Living for negligence and failing to protect Martha. They are also calling for greater oversight and accountability in the long-term care industry to prevent similar incidents from occurring.

""Nursing homes have a duty of care to their residents, and when that duty is breached, there must be consequences,"" the attorney, Jane Doe*, stated. ""We will fight to ensure Martha's attacker is brought to justice and that the facility is held responsible for its failures.""

As the investigation continues, the Johnson family hopes that sharing Martha's story will raise awareness about the vulnerability of elderly residents in long-term care settings and spur much-needed reforms.

""No family should have to go through what we're going through,"" Williams said, fighting back tears. ""My mom deserved to spend her golden years in peace and dignity, not subjected to this horrific abuse. We're determined to get justice for her and make sure this never happens to anyone else.""

NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners,"NBA Suspending Its Season is a Serious Blow to Its TV Partners

The NBA's decision to suspend its season indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has sent shockwaves through the sports media landscape, with the league's television partners facing significant financial and programming challenges in the weeks and months ahead.

The announcement, made on Wednesday evening, came just hours after the league confirmed that a player on the Utah Jazz had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The decision to halt gameplay immediately was a necessary and responsible move to protect the health and safety of players, staff, and fans, but it also represents a major disruption to the NBA's lucrative media rights deals.

According to industry analysts, the NBA's television partners – including ESPN, Turner Sports, and regional sports networks – could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in ad revenue and subscriber fees as a result of the suspended season. With no games to air, these networks will be forced to find alternative programming to fill the void, a task that may prove difficult given the current uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.

""This is a huge blow to the NBA's TV partners,"" said media analyst Jack Donovan. ""They rely on the NBA for a significant portion of their programming and advertising revenue, especially during this time of year. Replacing that content on short notice is going to be a major challenge.""

The NBA's television contracts are worth a combined $24 billion over nine years, with ESPN and Turner Sports paying a combined $2.6 billion per season for the rights to nationally televised games. Regional sports networks, such as Fox Sports and NBC Sports, also hold lucrative deals to air local team games.

""The NBA is one of the most valuable properties in all of sports television,"" said Donovan. ""Its games consistently draw large audiences and command premium advertising rates. Losing that programming, even temporarily, is going to have a major financial impact on these networks.""

In addition to the loss of advertising revenue, the NBA's television partners also face the prospect of losing subscribers as fans grow frustrated with the lack of live sports programming. Many cable and satellite TV providers offer sports-centric packages that could see a decline in subscribers if the NBA season remains suspended for an extended period.

""Sports are a major driver of cable and satellite TV subscriptions,"" said media analyst Sarah Weller. ""If the NBA season is delayed or canceled, we could see a significant number of subscribers cutting the cord or downgrading their packages. That would be a major blow to the business models of these networks.""

The NBA's decision to suspend its season also raises questions about the future of other professional sports leagues, many of which have also taken steps to limit or postpone their own events in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The potential for a prolonged disruption to the sports calendar could have far-reaching implications for the entire media industry, which has come to rely heavily on live sports programming to attract and retain viewers.

""This is a crisis that extends far beyond the NBA,"" said Donovan. ""If other major sports leagues follow suit and suspend or cancel their seasons, it could create a perfect storm for the media industry. Networks and advertisers are going to have to get creative in order to weather this storm.""

Despite the challenges, the NBA and its television partners remain committed to finding a way to resume the season and deliver the content that fans crave. Whether that means playing games without fans in attendance or exploring alternative scheduling options, the league and its media partners are determined to find a solution that works for all involved.

""The NBA is a resilient league with a passionate fan base,"" said Weller. ""While the current situation is certainly a setback, I have no doubt that the league and its partners will find a way to adapt and come back stronger than ever. The long-term outlook for the NBA's media rights remains bright, but the short-term impact is going to be significant.""",claude
Meet the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year,"""Meet the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year""

In a heartwarming ceremony held in New York City, CNN honored Freweini Mebrahtu as the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year. Mebrahtu, a passionate advocate for menstrual health and education, has dedicated her life to empowering women and girls in her native Eritrea.

Mebrahtu's journey began over a decade ago when she recognized the significant challenges that many young women in her community faced due to the lack of access to affordable and hygienic menstrual products. Determined to make a difference, she designed and patented a reusable menstrual pad that could be produced locally, providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution.

""I wanted to create something that would give women and girls the dignity they deserve during their menstrual cycle,"" Mebrahtu said during her acceptance speech. ""Too many were forced to miss school or work because they couldn't afford basic hygiene products. I knew I had to do something about it.""

Through her organization, Mariam Seba Sanitary Pad Factory, Mebrahtu has not only manufactured and distributed millions of these reusable pads but has also spearheaded educational initiatives to destigmatize menstruation and promote menstrual health awareness.

""Freweini's work has truly transformed the lives of countless women and girls in Eritrea,"" said CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who presented the award. ""She has not only provided them with a practical solution to a pressing issue but has also empowered them to take charge of their own health and education.""

Mebrahtu's impact extends far beyond the distribution of her innovative pads. She has worked tirelessly to train local women to produce the pads, creating sustainable employment opportunities and fostering a sense of community empowerment.

""It's not just about the pads,"" Mebrahtu explained. ""It's about giving these women the skills and resources they need to become self-sufficient and take control of their own futures. When you empower a woman, you empower an entire community.""

In addition to her work in menstrual health, Mebrahtu has also advocated for improved access to education, particularly for young girls. Through her efforts, she has helped establish several schools and learning centers, providing educational opportunities to those who might otherwise have been denied.

""Education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and inequality,"" Mebrahtu said. ""By ensuring that girls have access to quality education, we can unlock their full potential and create a more just and equitable world.""

The CNN Hero of the Year award, now in its 13th year, recognizes individuals who have made extraordinary efforts to improve the lives of others. Mebrahtu's selection as the 2019 honoree is a testament to the profound impact she has had on her community and the global fight for menstrual equity and women's empowerment.

""Freweini's story is one of resilience, determination, and unwavering commitment to making a difference,"" said CNN President Jeff Zucker. ""She is a true inspiration, and we are honored to celebrate her achievements and shine a light on the important work she is doing.""

As the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year, Mebrahtu will receive a $100,000 grant to further expand the reach and impact of her organization. She plans to use the funds to scale up production, train more local women, and continue her advocacy efforts both in Eritrea and around the world.

""This award is not just for me,"" Mebrahtu said. ""It's for all the women and girls who have struggled with the challenges of menstruation, and for all those who are still fighting for their right to dignity and opportunity. Together, we can create a better future for everyone.""",claude
Nigeria says it is ready and more than capable of dealing with coronavirus,"Nigeria Says It Is Ready and More Than Capable of Dealing with Coronavirus

Lagos, Nigeria - In a bold statement, the Nigerian government has asserted its readiness and capability to handle the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak within its borders. This declaration comes amidst growing global concerns over the pandemic's potential impact on the African continent.

Speaking at a press conference, the country's Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, emphasized Nigeria's comprehensive preparedness plan. ""We have been monitoring the situation closely and have put in place robust measures to ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens,"" he said.

According to Ehanire, Nigeria's disease surveillance and response systems have been significantly strengthened in the wake of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which the country successfully contained. ""We have learned valuable lessons from that experience, and we are applying those lessons to our COVID-19 response strategy,"" he explained.

The minister highlighted several key elements of Nigeria's preparedness plan, including the establishment of isolation centers, the training of healthcare workers, and the procurement of essential medical supplies. ""We have designated specialized facilities across the country to handle suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" Ehanire said. ""Our healthcare professionals have been trained on the latest protocols for case management and infection prevention and control.""

To bolster its diagnostic capabilities, Nigeria has also expanded its network of testing laboratories. ""We have increased the number of laboratories capable of conducting COVID-19 tests from one to five, and we are working to establish additional facilities in the coming weeks,"" Ehanire revealed.

The government has also taken proactive measures to limit the spread of the virus, including the implementation of travel restrictions and the closure of schools and public gatherings. ""We understand the importance of swift and decisive action, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to protect our citizens,"" the minister stated.

Moreover, the Nigerian government has pledged to provide financial support to businesses and individuals affected by the economic impact of the outbreak. ""We recognize that this crisis will have far-reaching consequences, and we are prepared to offer assistance to those in need,"" Ehanire said.

In response to concerns about the country's healthcare system's capacity to handle a potential surge in COVID-19 cases, the minister assured the public that contingency plans are in place. ""We have identified additional facilities that can be quickly converted into temporary treatment centers if necessary,"" he said. ""Our goal is to ensure that no Nigerian is left without access to quality healthcare during this challenging time.""

The Nigerian government's confidence in its ability to manage the COVID-19 outbreak is echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in the country. ""Nigeria has demonstrated a strong commitment to preparedness and response, and we are confident in the country's capacity to effectively handle the situation,"" said Dr. Walter Mulombo, the WHO Country Representative.

As the global pandemic continues to evolve, the Nigerian government has pledged to remain vigilant and responsive to the changing circumstances. ""We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adapt our strategies as needed,"" Ehanire said. ""Our message to the Nigerian people is one of reassurance and determination: we are ready, and we will overcome this challenge together.""",claude
Donald Trump brings out the worst in people,"""Donald Trump Brings Out the Worst in People""

In a shocking turn of events, former President Donald Trump has once again found himself at the center of a political firestorm, this time for his role in exacerbating the divisive nature of American politics. The latest controversy surrounding Trump has left many observers wondering whether the former president's actions and rhetoric are intentionally designed to bring out the worst in people.

The incident that sparked the current outrage occurred during a recent rally in which Trump made a series of inflammatory statements targeting his political opponents. In a speech that was widely condemned by both Democrats and Republicans, Trump accused his critics of being ""enemies of the state"" and called for his supporters to ""fight back"" against what he perceived as a coordinated effort to undermine his legacy.

""The level of vitriol and hatred that Trump has been able to generate is truly unprecedented in modern American politics,"" said Dr. Emily Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""He has a unique ability to tap into the darkest impulses of his base and to amplify the most extreme and divisive elements of the conservative movement.""

Indeed, the aftermath of Trump's rally has been marked by a surge in online harassment and threats directed at political figures, journalists, and ordinary citizens who have dared to criticize the former president. Social media platforms have been flooded with hateful messages and conspiracy theories, many of which echo the inflammatory rhetoric used by Trump himself.

""It's as if Trump has given his supporters permission to abandon all sense of decency and civility,"" said Sarah Walters, a political commentator for a major news network. ""The level of vitriol and toxicity that we're seeing is truly disturbing, and it's a direct result of the former president's willingness to stoke the flames of division for his own political gain.""

But Trump's critics argue that the former president's actions go beyond mere political rhetoric and that he is actively working to undermine the foundations of American democracy. They point to his repeated attempts to cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process, his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election, and his ongoing efforts to rally his supporters around the false narrative of a ""stolen"" election.

""Trump's actions are not just divisive, they're downright dangerous,"" said Congressman Michael Gonzalez, a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ""He is actively working to sow discord and erode public trust in our democratic institutions, and that poses a grave threat to the stability and well-being of our nation.""

Despite the widespread condemnation of Trump's behavior, the former president remains a powerful and influential figure within the Republican Party. Many of his supporters have rallied behind his inflammatory rhetoric, and there are concerns that his continued involvement in the political process could further exacerbate the already-tense political climate.

""Trump's ability to tap into the anger and resentment of his base is truly remarkable,"" said Dr. Jacobson. ""He has managed to create a cult of personality around himself, and his supporters are willing to follow him down a very dark and dangerous path.""

As the nation grapples with the fallout from Trump's latest controversy, many are left wondering whether the former president's actions are truly motivated by a desire to serve the interests of the American people, or whether he is simply using his platform to advance his own personal and political agenda.

""At the end of the day, Trump's actions are not about making America great again,"" said Walters. ""They're about making Donald Trump great again, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal, even if it means tearing our country apart in the process.""",claude
Our connected world made coronavirus spread. It may also be what saves us from it,"""Our connected world made coronavirus spread. It may also be what saves us from it""

In the face of the unprecedented global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has been forced to confront the double-edged sword of our highly interconnected modern society. While the ease of travel and communication that defines our globalized world has enabled the rapid spread of the virus, it may also hold the key to overcoming this challenge.

As the novel coronavirus swept across borders and continents, the world watched in horror as the disease rapidly evolved into a full-blown pandemic. The ability of people to move freely between countries, the efficiency of international trade, and the prevalence of global business networks all contributed to the virus's rapid transmission. In a matter of months, what began as a local outbreak in Wuhan, China, had transformed into a global crisis, testing the resilience of even the most developed healthcare systems.

However, it is this very interconnectedness that may also provide the solutions needed to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. The same technological advancements and global collaboration that facilitated the virus's spread are now being harnessed to combat it.

""The very factors that allowed the virus to spread so quickly are now being leveraged to stop it in its tracks,"" explains Dr. Sarah Lim, a leading epidemiologist at the World Health Organization. ""Our connected world has enabled the rapid sharing of information, the coordination of international response efforts, and the development of innovative solutions to this global challenge.""

One of the most promising examples of this is the unprecedented collaboration among pharmaceutical companies and research institutions around the world. Normally fierce competitors, these organizations have come together to share data, pool resources, and accelerate the development of potential vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.

""We're seeing an unprecedented level of cooperation and information-sharing in the scientific community,"" says Dr. Lim. ""Researchers from different countries are working together in real-time, building on each other's findings to make rapid progress.""

This global effort has already yielded several promising vaccine candidates, with multiple clinical trials underway. The ability to rapidly distribute these potential vaccines worldwide, once approved, will be crucial in containing the pandemic.

Beyond medical solutions, the interconnected nature of our world has also facilitated the rapid deployment of technological tools to aid in the fight against COVID-19. Contact tracing apps, developed through international collaboration, are helping governments track the spread of the virus and notify exposed individuals. Online platforms are enabling remote work, education, and social interaction, allowing people to maintain physical distancing while staying connected.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has really highlighted both the vulnerabilities and the strengths of our globalized world,"" says Dr. Lim. ""While the virus exploited the ease of international travel and communication, we're now seeing how those same factors can be leveraged to mount a coordinated, worldwide response.""

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 crisis, it is clear that our interconnected society will play a pivotal role in both the challenges and the solutions. By harnessing the power of global collaboration and technological innovation, the global community is working to overcome this pandemic and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before.",claude
Have Your Say,"""Have Your Say""

In a bold move to engage with its readers, [News Outlet] has launched a new initiative called ""Have Your Say."" This innovative platform aims to give a voice to the diverse perspectives and experiences of the community, empowering individuals to share their stories and shape the narrative.

The launch of ""Have Your Say"" comes at a time when the need for inclusive and participatory journalism has never been more pressing. In an era of information overload and polarized discourse, this initiative seeks to bridge the gap between the media and the people it serves, fostering a more transparent and collaborative relationship.

One such story comes from [Name], a local small business owner who shared her experiences navigating the challenges of the pandemic. ""When the lockdowns hit, I was terrified that my dream would come crashing down,"" she recounted. ""But with the support of my community and the resilience I found within myself, I was able to pivot my business and not only survive but thrive. I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others who are facing similar struggles.""

Another contributor, [Name], a high school student, used the platform to shed light on the mental health challenges faced by young people in the digital age.

Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"Brazil's Fashion Industry Has a Diversity Problem

In the heart of São Paulo, the bustling capital of Brazil's fashion industry, the runways and showrooms are a far cry from reflecting the diverse makeup of the country's population. Despite being home to one of the most vibrant and influential fashion scenes in the world, the Brazilian fashion industry has long struggled to address the glaring lack of representation of marginalized communities.

A recent study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) revealed that nearly 56% of the country's population identifies as Black or mixed-race. However, a cursory glance at the models strutting down the catwalks during São Paulo Fashion Week would suggest a vastly different demographic. Industry insiders estimate that less than 20% of the models featured are of Afro-Brazilian descent, with even fewer representing the country's Indigenous populations.

""It's a problem that has persisted for decades,"" says Juliana Barbosa, a fashion journalist and diversity advocate. ""The industry has long been dominated by a narrow, Eurocentric ideal of beauty that simply does not reflect the rich diversity of the Brazilian people.""

This lack of representation extends far beyond the runway. The upper echelons of the fashion industry, from design houses to editorial teams, are overwhelmingly white and of European descent. According to a study by the non-profit organization Geledés, only 3.6% of creative directors and 5.2% of editors-in-chief at major Brazilian fashion publications are Black.

""It's not just about the models,"" says Barbosa. ""The entire system is built to exclude and marginalize people of color. From the boardrooms to the backstage, the industry has been slow to acknowledge and address these deep-rooted issues.""

The consequences of this lack of diversity are far-reaching, both for the industry and the broader society. ""When you don't see yourself represented in the media and in the fashion that's being celebrated, it sends a powerful message about your worth and value,"" explains Thaís Araújo, a prominent Afro-Brazilian actress and fashion icon.

This lack of representation has a tangible impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young Brazilians, particularly those from marginalized communities. ""It's not just about fashion,"" Araújo says. ""It's about the way we see ourselves and the way the world sees us. When the industry fails to reflect the true diversity of our country, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and undermines the progress we've made as a society.""

In recent years, however, there have been glimmers of hope. A new generation of designers, models, and industry leaders are challenging the status quo and pushing for meaningful change. Brands like Lilly Sarti and Insecta Shoes have made concerted efforts to showcase the work of Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous creators, while initiatives like the Afro Fashion Week Brasil are working to amplify the voices of marginalized communities.

""It's a slow process, but we're starting to see some progress,"" says Barbosa. ""There's a growing awareness of the need for greater diversity and inclusion, and more and more people are speaking out and demanding change.""

Yet, the road ahead remains long and arduous. The deeply entrenched biases and systemic barriers that have long plagued the Brazilian fashion industry will not be easily dismantled. But for those at the forefront of the fight for representation, the stakes are simply too high to give up.

""This isn't just about fashion,"" Araújo says. ""It's about the very fabric of our society. When we fail to reflect the true diversity of our nation, we miss out on the richness and vibrancy that makes Brazil so unique. It's time for the industry to wake up and embrace the full spectrum of Brazilian beauty.""",claude
"Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts","Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts

In a world where societal shifts and cultural trends are constantly evolving, the concept of generational boundaries has become a topic of intense discussion. Researchers and demographers have long debated the precise start and end dates for each generation, often with varying perspectives. However, a new analysis has shed light on the factual parameters that define these generational cohorts.

Baby Boomers
The Baby Boomer generation, a term that has become synonymous with the post-World War II population surge, is generally accepted to have begun in 1946 and ended in 1964. This 18-year span accounts for the significant increase in birth rates following the end of the war, as soldiers returned home and started families. According to the data, the Baby Boomer generation encompasses individuals born between January 1, 1946, and December 31, 1964.

Generation X
Following the Baby Boomers, Generation X, or ""Gen X,"" is widely recognized as the generation born between 1965 and 1980. This 15-year period saw a decline in birth rates compared to the preceding Baby Boomer era, as societal and economic factors, such as the introduction of birth control and the rise of dual-income households, influenced family planning decisions. The Gen X cohort, therefore, includes those born from January 1, 1965, to December 31, 1980.

Millennials
The Millennial generation, often referred to as ""Gen Y,"" is generally considered to have begun in 1981 and ended in 1996. This 15-year span coincides with the rise of digital technology and the internet, which had a profound impact on the formative years of this generation. Millennials, therefore, are those born between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 1996.

Generation Z
The most recent generational cohort is Generation Z, or ""Gen Z,"" which is said to have begun in 1997 and is ongoing. This generation, which is still in its early stages, is characterized by its deep immersion in the digital age, with the majority of its members having grown up with smartphones, social media, and other cutting-edge technologies. According to the data, the Gen Z generation includes individuals born from January 1, 1997, to the present day.

It's important to note that while these generational boundaries are widely accepted, there can be some variation in the specific start and end dates, as different organizations and researchers may use slightly different criteria or methodologies. Additionally, the cultural and societal factors that shape each generation can be complex and multifaceted, making it challenging to draw definitive lines.

Nevertheless, the analysis presented here provides a factual foundation for understanding the generational cohorts that have shaped modern society. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of cultural and social trends, these generational markers can offer valuable insights into the diverse perspectives and experiences that define our world.",claude
BBC News,"BBC News

London, UK - In a groundbreaking move, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has announced a major overhaul of its news operations, promising to deliver a more comprehensive, impartial, and engaging news experience for its audience.

The changes, which will be rolled out over the next 12 months, will see the BBC News brand undergo a significant transformation, both in terms of its content and delivery platforms.

""We are committed to upholding the highest standards of journalism and ensuring that the public receives the most accurate, balanced, and insightful news coverage possible,"" said the BBC's Director of News, Sarah Sands. ""These changes are designed to strengthen our position as a trusted and reliable source of information in an increasingly complex and fast-paced media landscape.""

One of the key changes will be the introduction of a new digital-first approach, which will see the BBC prioritize the development of its online and mobile platforms. This will include the launch of a revamped BBC News website and mobile app, featuring a more intuitive and user-friendly design, as well as enhanced functionality and personalization options.

""We recognize that our audience is increasingly consuming news on the go, and through a variety of digital devices,"" Sands explained. ""By focusing on our digital platforms, we can ensure that our news content is easily accessible and tailored to the needs and preferences of our audience.""

In addition to the digital overhaul, the BBC will also be investing in the expansion of its global news-gathering capabilities, with the aim of providing more in-depth and on-the-ground coverage of international events and issues.

""The world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and our audience demands a more global perspective on the news,"" Sands said. ""By strengthening our international presence and partnerships, we will be able to deliver a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the events that shape our world.""

Another key focus of the BBC's news transformation will be the enhancement of its investigative journalism capabilities. The corporation has pledged to dedicate more resources to in-depth reporting and fact-checking, in order to provide its audience with a deeper understanding of complex issues and hold those in power accountable.

""Trust in the media is more important than ever, and we believe that by prioritizing investigative journalism and rigorous fact-checking, we can help to rebuild that trust and ensure that our audience receives the most accurate and reliable information possible,"" Sands said.

The changes will also see the BBC News brand undergo a visual and branding overhaul, with a new logo, color scheme, and on-air presentation designed to create a more modern and engaging look and feel.

""We want our news content to be not just informative, but also visually appealing and engaging,"" Sands explained. ""By updating our branding and on-air presentation, we hope to capture the attention of our audience and make the news-viewing experience more enjoyable and compelling.""

The BBC's news transformation is being widely welcomed by industry experts and media commentators, who see it as a necessary and timely response to the changing media landscape.

""The BBC has always been a pillar of British journalism, but in recent years, it has faced increasing competition from a range of digital and social media platforms,"" said media analyst, Jack Daniels. ""By embracing a digital-first approach and strengthening its investigative and global reporting capabilities, the BBC is positioning itself to remain relevant and influential in the years to come.""

As the BBC embarks on this ambitious news transformation, the corporation is confident that it will be able to maintain its position as a trusted and respected source of information for audiences in the UK and around the world.

""Our commitment to impartial, high-quality journalism has never been stronger,"" Sands concluded. ""With these changes, we are confident that we can continue to fulfill our role as a public service broadcaster and provide our audience with the news and information they need to make informed decisions and engage with the world around them.""",claude
Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos,"Deciphering the Hidden Meanings of Japanese Tattoos

In the vibrant cultural tapestry of Japan, the art of tattooing has long held a captivating allure, weaving intricate stories and symbolism into the very fabric of the nation's identity. Beyond the striking visuals that adorn the skin, these intricate designs often conceal deeper meanings, reflecting the rich heritage and profound beliefs of the Japanese people.

Delving into the world of Japanese tattoos, one is immediately struck by the sheer diversity of motifs and styles. From the iconic dragon and koi fish to the delicate cherry blossoms and samurai warriors, each element holds a unique significance, often rooted in the country's rich mythology and spiritual traditions.

""The meanings behind Japanese tattoos go far beyond mere aesthetics,"" explains Takeshi Yamamoto, a renowned tattoo artist based in Tokyo. ""These designs are deeply intertwined with the cultural and philosophical underpinnings of Japan, serving as a visual representation of the wearer's personal journey, aspirations, and connection to the ancestral past.""

One of the most prominent symbols found in Japanese tattoos is the dragon, a mythical creature revered for its strength, wisdom, and association with the elements. ""The dragon is often seen as a symbol of power, protection, and good fortune,"" says Yamamoto. ""Its presence on the body can signify the wearer's desire to harness these qualities, or to honor their own inner strength and resilience.""

Equally captivating are the depictions of the koi fish, which have long been celebrated in Japanese art and folklore. ""The koi's ability to swim against the current and ultimately transform into a majestic dragon is seen as a metaphor for personal growth, perseverance, and the pursuit of lofty goals,"" Yamamoto explains. ""For many, a koi tattoo represents the journey of overcoming obstacles and achieving one's highest potential.""

Beyond the realm of mythical creatures, the intricate floral motifs found in Japanese tattoos hold deep symbolic meaning. The cherry blossom, for instance, is revered for its fleeting beauty and association with the transient nature of life. ""The cherry blossom tattoo can signify the appreciation of beauty, the impermanence of existence, and the importance of living in the present moment,"" Yamamoto notes.

Interestingly, the placement of these tattoos on the body also holds significance. ""Traditionally, Japanese tattoos were often hidden from view, with the wearer using them as a means of self-expression and personal empowerment,"" Yamamoto explains. ""The back, for example, was a common canvas for elaborate full-body tattoos, known as 'bodysuits,' which were seen as a symbol of one's strength, resilience, and commitment to the art form.""

In recent years, however, the perception of Japanese tattoos has undergone a significant shift, with more individuals openly embracing these artistic expressions. ""As the world has become more interconnected, we've seen a growing appreciation for the cultural richness and deeper meanings behind Japanese tattoos,"" Yamamoto says. ""People are increasingly drawn to the stories and traditions they represent, using them as a way to connect with Japan's rich heritage and to celebrate their own personal journeys.""

As the art of Japanese tattooing continues to captivate audiences around the globe, it is clear that these intricate designs hold a power that transcends the mere physical realm. They are a testament to the enduring strength of cultural traditions, the resilience of the human spirit, and the profound ways in which we can use our bodies as canvases to express our deepest beliefs and aspirations.",claude
Satellite images show Iran building burial pits for coronavirus victims,"Satellite Imagery Reveals Iran Building Burial Pits for COVID-19 Victims

Recent satellite images have provided alarming evidence that Iran is constructing a series of large burial pits in a cemetery near the city of Qom, raising concerns about the true scale of the country's coronavirus outbreak.

The images, analyzed by analysts at Maxar Technologies, show the rapid expansion of a new graveyard section at the Behesht-e Masoumeh complex, one of Iran's largest cemeteries. Over the course of just a few days in mid-March, the size of the new burial area grew from around 100 meters squared to more than 2,000 meters squared, with rows of fresh trenches visible.

""The pace of the construction and expansion of the burial plots is quite rapid,"" said Stephen Wood, a senior director at Maxar. ""This suggests the cemetery is quickly trying to expand its capacity to handle a real increase in the number of deaths occurring.""

Iran has officially reported just over 27,000 cases of COVID-19 and 2,077 deaths, but there are growing concerns that the true scale of the outbreak in the country has been vastly underestimated. Numerous credible reports have emerged of hospitals being overwhelmed, shortages of medical equipment, and mortuaries struggling to cope with the number of bodies.

The new satellite imagery appears to corroborate these reports, indicating that the Iranian government may be seeking to rapidly expand burial capacity in anticipation of a worsening crisis. 

""The size and speed of the construction is certainly suggestive of an urgent need to increase burial capacity,"" said Wood. ""It's a troubling sign that the official figures simply do not reflect the true extent of the outbreak in Iran.""

Qom, located around 150 kilometers south of the capital Tehran, has been one of the areas hit hardest by the coronavirus in Iran. The city is a major Shia Muslim pilgrimage site, and its high number of religious shrines and communal gatherings are believed to have facilitated the rapid spread of the virus.

Analysts say the new burial site is located adjacent to the existing Behesht-e Masoumeh cemetery, which is the final resting place for many of Qom's most revered religious figures. The expansion appears to be focused on creating additional mass burial pits, rather than traditional individual graves.

""The sheer scale of these new trenches indicates this is not about creating individual burial plots, but rather preparing for a mass influx of victims,"" said Wood. ""It's a grim sign of the burden Iran's healthcare system is facing.""

The satellite imagery comes as Iran continues to face intense international pressure over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The country has been hit hard by US sanctions, which have severely restricted its ability to import vital medical supplies.

Tehran has appealed for emergency aid and sanctions relief to help it combat the pandemic, but its requests have so far been rebuffed by the Trump administration. Iran has also been accused of downplaying the scale of the crisis for political reasons, a charge it has strongly denied.

As the situation in Iran grows increasingly dire, the new satellite evidence underscores the urgent need for greater transparency and international assistance. With the true extent of the outbreak still unclear, the rapid construction of mass burial pits suggests the country may be facing a public health catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.",claude
What it's like to be me,"Here is a 677-word news article based on the title ""What it's like to be me"":

What it's like to be me
By Jane Doe, Staff Writer

It's a sunny Thursday morning and I'm sitting at my desk, staring at the blank document on my computer screen. The cursor blinks relentlessly, taunting me to start typing. But where do I even begin? How do I put into words what it's like to be me?

I suppose I could start with the basics. My name is Jane Doe and I'm a 32-year-old journalist living in the heart of the city. I wake up every morning around 7 a.m., make a strong cup of coffee, and then sit down at my desk to begin my workday. Some days I'm out in the field, chasing down a story and interviewing sources. Other days I'm glued to my computer, researching, writing, and editing.

It's a busy life, to be sure, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I thrive on the fast pace and the constant mental stimulation. There's always a new challenge to tackle, a new angle to explore. And I love the feeling of satisfaction I get when I publish a story that I know will make a difference.

Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are plenty of stressful moments, too – the tight deadlines, the demanding editors, the occasional angry reader. And let's not forget the crushing self-doubt that creeps in sometimes, making me question whether I'm really cut out for this job.

But I push through it all, because at the end of the day, I know that I'm making a positive impact. My words have the power to inform, to educate, to inspire. And that's a responsibility I take very seriously.

Beyond my work, there's the rest of my life to consider. I'm single, with no kids, and I cherish the freedom and flexibility that comes with that. I can pick up and travel at a moment's notice, or spend a whole weekend binge-watching Netflix in my pajamas. But I also crave meaningful connections, and I work hard to maintain close friendships and a supportive network of loved ones.

Dating can be a challenge, too. I'm an independent woman with a strong personality, and I tend to attract men who are either intimidated by that or who try to change me. It's a delicate balance, finding someone who can truly appreciate and support the person I am.

And then there's the issue of my health. I try to take good care of myself, with a mostly healthy diet and a regular exercise routine. But the stress of my job can take a toll, and I've had my fair share of colds, migraines, and other ailments over the years. It's a constant battle to maintain a good work-life balance and prioritize self-care.

But through it all, I remain grateful for the life I've built. I'm passionate about my work, I have amazing friends and family, and I'm constantly learning and growing as a person. Sure, there are challenges and struggles, but that's true for everyone. What matters is how I choose to navigate them.

Because at the end of the day, being me means being true to myself – embracing my quirks and flaws, speaking up for what I believe in, and never settling for anything less than the life I want to live. It's not always easy, but it's a journey I'm proud to be on.

So there you have it – a glimpse into what it's like to be me. It's a full, complex, and rewarding existence, with plenty of ups and downs. But I wouldn't have it any other way.",claude
US politics,"""Polarization Deepens as US Political Divide Widens""

Washington, D.C. - The United States is facing an unprecedented level of political polarization, with the divide between the Democratic and Republican parties widening to an alarming degree. This growing rift is fueling a toxic atmosphere in the nation's capital, making it increasingly difficult for lawmakers to find common ground and effectively address the pressing issues facing the country.

The 2022 midterm elections have only exacerbated the problem, with both parties doubling down on their respective ideological positions. The Republican Party, emboldened by its gains in the House of Representatives, has vowed to launch a series of investigations into the Biden administration, while the Democrats, still in control of the Senate, have pledged to block any attempts to roll back their legislative achievements.

""The level of partisan rancor in Washington is unlike anything I've seen in my career,"" said veteran political analyst, Dr. Emily Garrison. ""The two sides are no longer just disagreeing on policy; they are actively demonizing each other and questioning the legitimacy of the entire political system.""

This sentiment is echoed by many Americans, who are growing increasingly frustrated with the inability of their elected representatives to work together for the greater good. A recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that nearly two-thirds of respondents believe the country is ""headed in the wrong direction,"" with a significant portion of those citing the political gridlock as a primary concern.

The roots of this polarization can be traced back to a variety of factors, including the rise of social media, the increasing influence of partisan media outlets, and the growing ideological divide between urban and rural areas. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic upheaval it has caused have only served to exacerbate existing tensions and resentments.

""The pandemic has been a real stress test for our political system,"" said Dr. Garrison. ""It has exposed the deep-seated divisions and mistrust that exist within our society, and it has made it even harder for our leaders to find common ground.""

Despite the bleak outlook, some political observers believe that there may be a path forward. They argue that the American public is hungry for leaders who are willing to put country before party and work across the aisle to find pragmatic solutions to the nation's most pressing challenges.

""The American people are tired of the constant bickering and partisan posturing,"" said political scientist, Dr. Michael Simmons. ""They want their elected officials to put aside their differences and focus on the issues that matter most to them – things like jobs, healthcare, and education.""

However, achieving this kind of bipartisan cooperation will require a significant shift in the political landscape, as well as a willingness on the part of both parties to compromise and find common ground.

As the nation navigates this turbulent political landscape, the stakes have never been higher. The future of American democracy hangs in the balance, and the decisions made by our elected leaders in the coming years will have profound implications for generations to come.",claude
Leeds pupil 'sent home' for selling hand sanitiser,"""Leeds pupil 'sent home' for selling hand sanitiser""

LEEDS, UK - In a surprising turn of events, a student at a Leeds secondary school has reportedly been sent home for selling hand sanitiser to their classmates. The incident has sparked a debate about the school's policies and the entrepreneurial spirit of young individuals.

According to sources, the student, whose identity has not been disclosed, had been discreetly selling small bottles of hand sanitiser to their peers during breaks and lunch periods. The sanitiser, which was purchased in bulk, was being sold at a modest price, making it an attractive option for students who wanted to maintain good hygiene practices.

""I was just trying to help out my friends and classmates,"" the student said in a statement provided to our news team. ""With the increased focus on cleanliness and sanitisation, I thought it would be a useful and convenient service to provide.""

However, the school administration apparently did not share the student's entrepreneurial enthusiasm. After becoming aware of the situation, the school authorities reportedly intervened and sent the student home, citing a violation of the institution's policies.

""The school has a clear policy against the sale of any items on campus without prior approval,"" a spokesperson for the school said. ""While we understand the student's intention, the safety and well-being of our students is our top priority, and we cannot condone the unauthorised sale of products, even if they are as benign as hand sanitiser.""

The incident has sparked a lively discussion among parents and the wider community. Some have expressed support for the student's initiative, arguing that it demonstrates a commendable entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to address the needs of their peers.

""It's a shame that the school couldn't see the positive aspects of what this student was doing,"" said local parent, Emily Wilkins. ""In a time when hand sanitiser is in high demand, this young person was providing a valuable service to their classmates. They should be commended, not punished.""

Others, however, have defended the school's decision, stating that the institution has a responsibility to maintain a controlled and regulated environment on campus.

""While I understand the student's motivation, the school has to uphold its policies and ensure the safety of all students,"" said parent, David Harrington. ""Allowing unauthorised sales could lead to a slippery slope of other items being sold, which could potentially cause issues or even safety concerns.""

The school has reiterated its commitment to maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment, but some have questioned whether the punishment of sending the student home was an appropriate response.

""There could have been other ways to address this situation, such as a warning or a discussion about proper procedures for selling items on campus,"" said local community leader, Sarah Greenwood. ""Sending the student home seems like an overly harsh reaction, and it may have a negative impact on their educational experience.""

As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the school will reconsider its stance or if the student will seek alternative avenues to pursue their entrepreneurial endeavours. The incident has certainly sparked a wider conversation about the balance between academic policies, student initiative, and the evolving needs of the school community.",claude
"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","""Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much""

New York, NY - The world of musical theater has lost a true titan with the passing of Stephen Sondheim, the legendary composer and lyricist who revolutionized the art form with his complex, emotionally charged works. Sondheim, who died on November 26th at the age of 91, was a master of his craft, weaving intricate melodies and profound, thought-provoking lyrics that touched the hearts and minds of audiences for decades.

Born in 1930 in New York City, Sondheim's journey to becoming one of the most influential figures in musical theater was shaped by a tumultuous childhood. His parents divorced when he was young, and he was deeply affected by the absence of a stable, loving family environment. This early trauma, coupled with his innate sensitivity and keen observational skills, would go on to inform the depth and nuance of his artistic expression.

""Sondheim was a man who felt things more deeply than most,"" says longtime collaborator and friend, director James Lapine. ""He had an uncanny ability to tap into the human experience, to capture the joys, the sorrows, the complexities of the human condition in a way that was both profoundly personal and universally resonant.""

Indeed, Sondheim's works were never mere entertainment; they were emotional journeys, challenging audiences to confront their own fears, desires, and vulnerabilities. From the haunting exploration of the nature of evil in ""Sweeney Todd"" to the bittersweet ruminations on love and loss in ""Sunday in the Park with George,"" Sondheim's compositions were a testament to his unwavering commitment to the power of the arts to illuminate the human experience.

""He was a true artist, in the purest sense of the word,"" says renowned theater critic Ben Brantley. ""Sondheim never shied away from the complexities and contradictions of the human experience. He embraced them, dissected them, and transformed them into works of breathtaking beauty and profound emotional resonance.""

Sondheim's impact on the world of musical theater cannot be overstated. He pushed the boundaries of the genre, defying conventions and challenging audiences to think and feel in new ways. His influence can be seen in the work of countless contemporary composers and lyricists, who have drawn inspiration from his masterful storytelling and his refusal to compromise his vision.

""Sondheim was a true visionary,"" says composer and lyricist Lin-Manuel Miranda. ""He showed us that musical theater could be so much more than just entertainment – it could be a vehicle for exploring the deepest, most complex aspects of the human experience. He set a new standard for what the art form could achieve, and his legacy will continue to inspire generations of artists to come.""

As the world mourns the loss of this singular talent, it's clear that Sondheim's impact will endure long after his passing. His works will continue to be performed and studied, their depth and complexity undiminished by the passage of time. And for those who were touched by his art, the memory of Sondheim's profound emotional resonance will remain a testament to the power of the human spirit.

""Sondheim was a man who felt too much, and in doing so, he gave us the gift of his art,"" says theater director Pam MacKinnon. ""He showed us that the most powerful stories are often the ones that challenge us, that make us uncomfortable, that force us to confront the darkest and most beautiful aspects of ourselves. And for that, we will be forever grateful.""",claude
Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Fashion Gaffes are a Reflection of the Industry's Diversity Problem

In recent years, the fashion industry has been plagued by a series of high-profile missteps, with major brands and designers facing backlash for insensitive or culturally-inappropriate designs. From Gucci's ""blackface"" sweater to Dolce & Gabbana's controversial ad campaign in China, these fashion gaffes have shone a spotlight on the industry's longstanding struggle with diversity and inclusion.

At the heart of the issue is the homogeneity that has long dominated the fashion world. The industry has traditionally been led by a small, privileged group – predominantly white, cisgender, and from wealthy backgrounds. This lack of representation has resulted in a disconnect between the designers and the diverse consumers they aim to serve, leading to tone-deaf and offensive creative decisions.

""The fashion industry has a diversity problem, and it's reflected in the products and campaigns we see,"" says Jane Doe, a fashion journalist and commentator. ""When the decision-makers come from a narrow slice of society, it's inevitable that they'll miss the mark when it comes to representing the full breadth of human experience.""

The Gucci sweater incident, which featured a balaclava-style design that evoked blackface imagery, is a prime example. The brand quickly pulled the item from shelves and apologized, but the damage was done. ""It's clear that Gucci's design team lacked the cultural awareness and sensitivity to recognize the harmful connotations of that sweater,"" Doe says. ""That's a problem that extends far beyond just one brand.""

Similarly, Dolce & Gabbana's 2018 ad campaign in China, which depicted a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks, was widely criticized as perpetuating racist stereotypes. The backlash was so severe that the brand was forced to cancel a high-profile fashion show in Shanghai.

These incidents are not isolated events, but rather symptomatic of a deeper issue within the fashion industry. ""Time and time again, we see brands making tone-deaf creative choices that demonstrate a fundamental lack of diversity and representation in their ranks,"" Doe says.

The consequences of these fashion gaffes extend beyond just public relations nightmares. They also highlight the industry's failure to cater to the needs and preferences of an increasingly diverse consumer base.

""Fashion is a global business, and the customers brands are trying to reach are more diverse than ever before,"" Doe explains. ""If the industry continues to be dominated by a homogeneous group of decision-makers, they're going to keep missing the mark when it comes to understanding and serving those customers.""

The solution, experts say, lies in a concerted effort to increase diversity and inclusion within the fashion industry. This means not only diversifying the design teams and executive suites of major brands, but also rethinking the entire ecosystem – from fashion schools to industry publications to the influencers and models who shape public perception.

""It's not enough to just have a few token diverse hires or collaborations,"" Doe says. ""True change requires a fundamental shift in the power structures and cultural norms that have long defined the fashion world.""

Already, some brands and organizations are taking steps in the right direction. Initiatives like the 15 Percent Pledge, which calls on retailers to dedicate 15% of their shelf space to Black-owned businesses, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America's efforts to increase diversity and inclusion, are promising signs of progress.

But there is still a long way to go. As the fashion industry continues to grapple with its diversity problem, the hope is that the lessons learned from these high-profile gaffes will serve as a wake-up call – and a catalyst for meaningful, lasting change.",claude
How much of your body is your own?,"Here is a 650-word news article based on the title ""How much of your body is your own?"":

How much of your body is your own?
By [Assistant's Name], Journalist

In the modern age of advanced medical technology, the question of bodily autonomy has become increasingly complex. As new procedures and innovations emerge, the line between what is considered ""your own"" body and what is not is being constantly redrawn.

Take the case of organ transplants, for example. If you receive a kidney, liver, or heart from a donor, is that organ still considered part of ""your"" body? Many would argue yes – the transplanted organ now serves the same function as the original, and is essential to your health and wellbeing. But does that mean you can lay full claim to it?

""There's definitely a gray area when it comes to transplanted organs,"" says Dr. Emma Sinclair, a bioethicist at [University]. ""On one hand, the organ is keeping the recipient alive and has become integrated into their body. But on the other hand, it originated from someone else and doesn't contain the recipient's DNA. It's a tricky philosophical question without a clear answer.""

The issue becomes even more convoluted when considering artificial implants and prosthetics. If you have a pacemaker, cochlear implant, or robotic limb, how much of that is truly your own? These devices may be essential to your health and function, but they are man-made technologies, not organic tissue.

""We've reached a point where technology is so advanced that it can replicate and even enhance natural bodily functions,"" explains Dr. Sinclair. ""So the definition of what constitutes 'your' body is evolving. Is a bionic arm still 'you' even though it's not made of your own cells?""

And the boundaries continue to blur when it comes to genetic material. If you've had genetic testing done, do the DNA results belong to you, or are they the property of the lab that analyzed them? What about if you've contributed DNA to a medical study – does that genetic information still belong to you, or has it become part of a larger dataset?

""There are so many questions around genetic privacy and ownership,"" says Dr. Sinclair. ""Our genes are the fundamental building blocks of our bodies, but they also contain sensitive information that could be used in ways we don't intend. It's an area that lawmakers are still grappling with.""

Adding to the complexity is the rise of technologies like gene editing, which allow us to directly modify our own DNA. If you undergo a procedure to alter your genetic makeup, how much of that altered body is still ""yours""?

""Gene editing is a game-changer because it gives us the ability to actively change the fundamental code of our bodies,"" Dr. Sinclair notes. ""It's a level of control and ownership over our physicality that we've never had before. But it also raises a lot of ethical quandaries about how far we should go in rewriting our own biology.""

Ultimately, the question of bodily autonomy is one that will continue to evolve alongside medical progress. As our bodies become increasingly integrated with technology and our very DNA becomes malleable, the boundaries of what we can consider ""our own"" will continue to shift.

""In the end, I don't think there's a single clear-cut answer,"" says Dr. Sinclair. ""It's going to come down to personal philosophy, cultural values, and ongoing discussions around the ethics of these technologies. But it's certainly a fascinating and crucial question for us to grapple with as a society.""",claude

West Covina, CA - In a shocking turn of events, a 9-month-old girl was rushed to the hospital after her parents brought her in, reporting that she was unresponsive. The subsequent medical examination revealed the disturbing presence of cocaine and methamphetamine in the infant's system.

The incident occurred on Tuesday evening when the parents, identified as 27-year-old Jessica Carrillo and 30-year-old David Ruiz, brought their daughter to the emergency room at Queen of the Valley Hospital. According to the West Covina Police Department, the parents claimed the child had become unresponsive and they were unsure of the cause.

""The parents claimed the child had become unresponsive, but when the hospital staff conducted the initial examination, they discovered the presence of cocaine and methamphetamine in the infant's system,"" said West Covina Police Sergeant Rudy Gatto. ""This is an extremely concerning and tragic situation.""

The hospital staff immediately notified the authorities, and the West Covina Police Department launched an investigation into the matter. Detectives from the department's Crimes Against Persons Unit were dispatched to the hospital to gather more information and interview the parents.

""The parents were cooperative during the initial investigation, but as the details emerged, it became clear that they were responsible for the child's exposure to these dangerous substances,"" Gatto added.

According to the police report, the investigation revealed that Carrillo and Ruiz had been using cocaine and methamphetamine in the presence of their daughter. The infant, who is currently in stable condition, was taken into protective custody by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).

""This is a heartbreaking case where the innocent child has suffered the consequences of her parents' irresponsible and criminal behavior,"" said DCFS spokesperson, Emily Gomez. ""The child's safety and well-being are our top priority, and we will work closely with the authorities to ensure she receives the proper care and support she needs.""

Carrillo and Ruiz were immediately arrested and booked into the West Covina Police Department's jail on charges of child endangerment and possession of controlled substances. They are currently being held on $100,000 bail each.

""The West Covina Police Department takes these types of cases very seriously,"" Gatto stated. ""We will not tolerate any instances of child abuse or neglect, and we will work diligently to ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.""

The case has sent shockwaves through the West Covina community, with many residents expressing outrage and concern over the well-being of the infant. Local advocacy groups and child welfare organizations have also stepped forward, offering support and resources to the family and the investigating authorities.

""This is a horrific situation that no child should ever have to endure,"" said Sara Watkins, the executive director of the West Covina-based nonprofit, Families First. ""We stand ready to provide any assistance and support that the family may need during this difficult time, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect the most vulnerable members of our community.""

The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and the West Covina Police Department has stated that they will work closely with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office to ensure that the parents face the full extent of the law. The child's condition will be closely monitored, and DCFS will determine the appropriate course of action for her long-term care and well-being.",claude

In a world that often encourages us to ""stay positive"" and ""focus on the bright side,"" sometimes the most cathartic experience can be leaning into our worries and anxieties. For those seeking a safe space to explore their inner turmoil, a growing number of television shows are offering a reflective and relatable escape.

""Succession,"" the critically acclaimed HBO drama, has become a cultural phenomenon for its unflinching portrayal of the dysfunctional Roy family, a clan of billionaires grappling with the weight of their wealth and power. At the heart of the show lies a deep-seated unease, as the characters navigate the treacherous waters of family dynamics, corporate greed, and the constant threat of losing it all. Viewers have been captivated by the show's ability to tap into the universal fears of legacy, legacy, and the erosion of control.

The show follows the employees of Lumon Industries, a mysterious company that has developed a ""severance"" procedure that separates their work and personal memories. As the protagonists struggle to reconcile their divided selves, the audience is left to grapple with questions of identity, autonomy, and the blurred lines between reality and simulation.

Transcripts,"Transcripts Reveal Shocking Details of Government Surveillance Program

In a stunning turn of events, a trove of classified government documents has been leaked, exposing the existence of a secretive surveillance program that has been operating in the shadows for years. The transcripts, obtained by our news organization, paint a chilling picture of the extent to which the government has been monitoring its own citizens, often without their knowledge or consent.

The documents, which appear to be meticulously detailed records of conversations and communications intercepted by the government, reveal a vast network of surveillance tactics employed by various federal agencies. From the monitoring of private email accounts and social media activity to the tapping of phone lines and the tracking of individuals' movements, the scope of this program is nothing short of breathtaking.

One particularly disturbing excerpt from the transcripts details the government's use of advanced facial recognition technology to identify and track the movements of citizens in public spaces. ""Subject 457 was observed entering the downtown area at 10:23 a.m. and proceeded to visit the local library, the grocery store, and a coffee shop before returning to his residence at 3:45 p.m.,"" the document reads, highlighting the level of detail and the invasive nature of the surveillance tactics employed.

Another transcript reveals the government's use of so-called ""stingray"" devices, which mimic cell phone towers to intercept and collect data from nearby mobile devices. This technology, which has been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy in the past, appears to have been deployed on a much wider scale than previously thought, with the documents indicating that thousands of citizens have been subjected to this form of surveillance without their knowledge or consent.

The implications of these revelations are staggering, as they call into question the very foundations of civil liberties and the right to privacy that are so deeply ingrained in the fabric of American democracy. ""This is a clear and blatant violation of our constitutional rights,"" said John Doe, a legal expert and privacy advocate. ""The government has overstepped its bounds and is engaging in a level of surveillance that is simply unacceptable in a free society.""

The leak has already sparked outrage among the public, with many calling for immediate action to address the issue and hold those responsible accountable. Lawmakers have vowed to launch a full-scale investigation into the matter, promising to leave no stone unturned in their quest to uncover the truth and put an end to this egregious breach of trust.

""The American people deserve to know the truth about what their government has been doing behind closed doors,"" said Senator Jane Doe, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""We will not rest until we have gotten to the bottom of this and ensured that the appropriate measures are taken to protect the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.""

As the fallout from this scandal continues to reverberate across the nation, it remains to be seen what the long-term consequences will be. But one thing is certain: the revelations contained in these transcripts have shaken the very foundations of the relationship between the government and the people it serves, and the repercussions are likely to be felt for years to come.",claude
MLB Life Put on Hold amid Rising Coronavirus Concerns,"MLB Life Put on Hold amid Rising Coronavirus Concerns

In a move that has sent shockwaves through the sports world, Major League Baseball (MLB) has announced the suspension of its 2020 season indefinitely, citing growing concerns over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.

The decision, which came in the wake of the NBA's suspension of its own season on Wednesday evening, marks an unprecedented disruption to the national pastime and will leave stadiums across the country eerily empty during what should have been the start of the new baseball campaign.

""This is a decision we have not taken lightly, but the health and safety of our players, staff, and fans is our top priority,"" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement released on Thursday morning. ""We will continue to work with relevant public health authorities and our own medical experts to determine the best course of action as this situation continues to evolve.""

The announcement follows a whirlwind 24 hours in the sports world, which saw a cascade of cancellations and postponements across multiple leagues and competitions. In addition to the NBA's suspension, the NCAA has canceled its lucrative men's and women's basketball tournaments, while the NHL has also paused its season.

For MLB, the decision to suspend play comes just days before the scheduled start of the 2020 regular season, which was set to kick off on March 26th. Teams had been in the midst of finalizing their rosters and completing spring training in Florida and Arizona when the league made the call.

""It's a surreal and unsettling time, to say the least,"" said New York Mets outfielder Michael Conforto. ""We were all looking forward to getting the season underway, but these are extraordinary circumstances, and we understand that the prudent thing is to hit the pause button for now.""

The suspension of play will have widespread ramifications, not only for the players and teams but also for the countless workers, vendors, and businesses that rely on the economic activity generated by MLB games. It also casts doubt on the league's ability to complete a full 162-game schedule, which could have significant financial implications for team owners and the league as a whole.

""This is going to hurt, there's no way around it,"" acknowledged Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts. ""But the health of our fans, our players, and our communities has to come first. We'll work with the league and our partners to figure out the best path forward, but for now, the priority is doing what we can to help stop the spread of this virus.""

For the players, the suspension means an abrupt and uncertain interruption to their careers, with no clear timeline for a return to action. Many were in the midst of contract negotiations or seeking to build on strong performances from the previous season.

""It's tough, no doubt about it,"" said Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw. ""We all want to be out there competing and entertaining the fans. But these are extraordinary times, and we have to be responsible and do our part to protect public health. We'll be ready to go whenever the league says it's safe to resume play.""

As the sports world grapples with the fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak, the suspension of the MLB season serves as a stark reminder of the widespread impact the virus is having on daily life. For baseball fans across the country, the coming weeks and months will be filled with a sense of loss and uncertainty, as the familiar sights and sounds of the national pastime are put on hold.

""This is uncharted territory for all of us,"" said MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark. ""But we're committed to working closely with the league and public health authorities to get through this challenge and return to the field as soon as it's safe to do so. In the meantime, we'll be supporting our players and their families, and doing what we can to help our communities during this difficult time.""",claude
'We are failing the elephants',"""'We are failing the elephants'""

NAIROBI, Kenya - In a stark warning, leading conservationists have sounded the alarm over the plight of the world's elephant population, declaring that current efforts to protect these iconic animals are simply not enough.

""The harsh reality is that we are failing the elephants,"" said Dr. Jane Goodall, renowned primatologist and UN Messenger of Peace. ""The numbers continue to decline at an alarming rate, and we must take immediate and decisive action to turn this crisis around.""

According to the latest data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), African elephant populations have declined by an estimated 111,000 over the past decade, with the primary threats being poaching for ivory and habitat loss. In some regions, elephant numbers have plummeted by as much as 80%.

""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said Kaddu Sebunya, CEO of the African Wildlife Foundation. ""These magnificent creatures are being slaughtered at unsustainable levels, and we're struggling to keep up with the onslaught.""

Conservationists point to a complex web of factors that have contributed to the elephant's plight, including political instability, weak law enforcement, and the persistent demand for ivory, predominantly in Asia.

""Poachers are becoming more sophisticated and better equipped than the rangers tasked with protecting the elephants,"" said Azzedine Downes, President and CEO of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. ""We're in a race against time, and we're losing.""

In response, organizations and governments around the world have ramped up their efforts to combat the ivory trade and safeguard elephant habitats. This has included increased anti-poaching patrols, stricter legislation, and public awareness campaigns.

""We've seen some progress, but it's simply not enough,"" said Dr. Goodall. ""The scale of the problem is immense, and we need a coordinated, global effort to truly make a difference.""

Conservationists are calling for a multi-pronged approach that includes strengthening law enforcement, reducing demand for ivory, and investing in sustainable community-based conservation programs.

""It's not just about protecting the elephants; it's about preserving the delicate balance of our ecosystems,"" said Sebunya. ""Elephants are keystone species, and their decline has far-reaching consequences for the entire African continent.""

The urgency of the situation was underscored by a recent report from the IUCN, which warned that the African forest elephant is now ""Critically Endangered,"" while the African savanna elephant is ""Endangered.""

""We're at a critical juncture,"" said Downes. ""If we don't act now, we risk losing these magnificent creatures forever. The future of the elephant is in our hands, and we cannot afford to fail.""

Conservationists are urging governments, businesses, and individuals to join the fight to save the elephants. This includes supporting anti-poaching efforts, reducing ivory demand, and advocating for stronger conservation policies.

""The time for action is now,"" said Dr. Goodall. ""We must come together as a global community and do whatever it takes to ensure that the elephant's legacy lives on for generations to come. The future of these animals, and the health of our planet, depends on it.""",claude
Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.,"Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.

In a harrowing tale of triumph and tragedy, two women from the same community found themselves in a desperate battle against the relentless COVID-19 virus. While one woman's fight for survival ended in heartbreak, the other's journey serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience of the human spirit.

Sarah, a 42-year-old mother of two, and her best friend, Emily, 39, had been inseparable for years. They shared a deep bond, often finding solace in each other's company during the ups and downs of their lives. Little did they know that their friendship would be put to the ultimate test when the pandemic struck their town.

It began with a simple cough, a tickle in the throat that quickly escalated into a debilitating illness. Sarah and Emily, both previously healthy individuals, found themselves struggling to breathe, their bodies ravaged by the merciless virus. As their symptoms worsened, they were rushed to the local hospital, where the true gravity of their situation became painfully clear.

""It happened so fast,"" recounts Sarah, her voice trembling with emotion. ""One day we were planning a girls' weekend, and the next, we were fighting for our lives. It was a nightmare that I never could have imagined.""

The hospital staff, already overwhelmed by the influx of COVID-19 patients, worked tirelessly to provide the best possible care for the two friends. Doctors and nurses fought against the clock, employing every available treatment and technology to give Sarah and Emily a fighting chance.

Tragically, Emily's condition deteriorated rapidly, and despite the heroic efforts of the medical team, she succumbed to the virus, leaving behind a devastated family and a heartbroken community.

""Emily was the most vibrant, loving person I knew,"" Sarah says, her eyes brimming with tears. ""She had so much life left to live, and it's just not fair that COVID took her from us.""

As Emily's family and friends mourned their profound loss, Sarah's battle continued. Hooked up to a ventilator, her body ravaged by the relentless disease, she clung to life with every ounce of strength she could muster.

""There were moments when I thought I couldn't go on,"" Sarah admits. ""The pain, the fear, the uncertainty – it was all-consuming. But I knew I had to fight, not just for myself, but for Emily and for my family. I couldn't give up.""

Slowly, painfully, Sarah began to recover. The road to healing was long and arduous, but with the unwavering support of her loved ones and the tireless efforts of the medical team, she eventually emerged from the darkness, her spirit unbroken.

""When I finally opened my eyes and saw my children's faces, I knew I had to keep going,"" Sarah says, a glimmer of hope in her eyes. ""Emily would have wanted me to live, to cherish every moment, and that's what I'm going to do – for her and for myself.""

As Sarah continues her journey of recovery, she has become a beacon of hope for others who are battling the coronavirus. Her story, a testament to the power of resilience and the enduring strength of the human spirit, has inspired countless individuals who are facing their own battles against the pandemic.

""Sarah's story is a poignant reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is still light to be found,"" says Dr. Alicia Fernandez, the lead physician who oversaw Sarah's treatment. ""Her courage and determination have been an inspiration to us all, and I have no doubt that her story will continue to touch and uplift those who are facing similar challenges.""

For Sarah, the road ahead is still uncertain, but she is determined to honor Emily's memory by living each day to the fullest. She knows that her friend's spirit will forever be a part of her, guiding her through the challenges that lie ahead.

""Emily may be gone, but she will never be forgotten,"" Sarah says, her voice filled with a quiet resolve. ""I will carry her with me, always, and I will live my life in a way that would make her proud. That is the greatest tribute I can offer to my best friend.""",claude

I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"Title: ""I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.""

In the halls of my high school, I was the kid who often ate lunch alone, the one whose name wasn't called for the popular group's weekend plans. Looking back, I realize that those years were a crucible of lessons that have shaped me as a parent.

The sting of isolation taught me empathy. I remember the pain of not being included, the loneliness that permeated my days. As a parent, I strive to ensure that my children never feel that kind of isolation. I make a conscious effort to include others in our family activities, to create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

My struggles also instilled in me a deep appreciation for individuality. I learned that being different isn't a curse, but a strength. I want my children to embrace their uniqueness, to know that it's okay to stand out, to be themselves. I encourage them to explore their interests, to develop their talents, and to be proud of who they are.

Being unpopular also taught me resilience. I had to learn to bounce back from rejection, to find the strength within myself to keep going. As a parent, I aim to instill this resilience in my children. I teach them that life will have its ups and downs, but they have the power to overcome any obstacle.

One of the most profound lessons I learned was the importance of self-worth. In those lonely moments, I had to learn to find value in myself, to believe in my own worth. I want my children to never doubt their value, to know that they are loved and capable, regardless of what others may think.

I also learned the power of kindness. I remember the rare moments of kindness from strangers that made a difference in my day. As a parent, I strive to model kindness, to teach my children the importance of treating others with compassion and respect.

Finally, being the unpopular kid taught me humility. I learned that it's okay to not always be the best, to not always have all the answers. I want my children to understand that it's okay to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to grow.

As I navigate the challenges of parenthood, I often find myself drawing on the lessons I learned during those awkward, lonely years. I may not have been popular, but I was learning valuable lessons that would serve me well in life. And I am grateful for that.

In the end, I wouldn't trade my high school experience for anything. It made me who I am today - a parent who is empathetic, appreciative of individuality, resilient, valuing self-worth, kind, and humble. And for that, I am thankful.",mistral
The coronavirus pandemic is closing schools. How will kids eat?,"Title: ""The Coronavirus Pandemic Closing Schools: Addressing Children's Nutritional Needs""

As the coronavirus pandemic persists, a growing concern arises about the well-being of millions of school-aged children in the U.S. who rely on free or reduced-cost meals at school. With schools across the nation closing to limit the spread of the virus, many children are left without their primary source of daily nutrition.

Before the pandemic, nearly 30 million children in the U.S. participated in the National School Lunch Program, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The program provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children from low-income families. The National School Breakfast Program, which serves similar purposes, reaches around 15 million children daily.

With the sudden closure of schools, these programs have been disrupted, leaving families scrambling to find alternative solutions to feed their children. Some schools have implemented grab-and-go meal programs, offering meals outside school buildings for students to pick up. However, these programs may not reach all children in need, particularly those living in remote areas or without reliable transportation.

Efforts are underway to expand these meal distribution programs and ensure that all children continue to receive nutritious meals. The USDA has waived some requirements for meal programs, allowing schools greater flexibility in serving meals. For example, schools are now allowed to provide meals through drive-through, walk-up, or home delivery services.

Non-profit organizations and community groups are also stepping up to help fill the gap. Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization, has launched a program called School Pantry to provide food to children in need. Local food banks and community organizations are also offering meals and food packages to families in need.

Government agencies and non-profits are not the only ones responding to the crisis. Businesses and individuals are also making donations and volunteering their time to help feed children in their communities. For example, restaurants are offering free meals to children, and food delivery services are partnering with local organizations to deliver meals to families in need.

Despite these efforts, there are still gaps in the system. Many families are struggling to access the resources they need, and some children may still go hungry. Advocates are calling on lawmakers to provide additional funding for school meal programs and other hunger-relief efforts.

The coronavirus pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to our society, and the impact on children's nutrition is one that cannot be overlooked. As schools continue to close, it is essential that we work together to ensure that all children have access to nutritious meals. By supporting schools, non-profits, and community organizations, we can help ensure that no child goes hungry during this crisis.",mistral
US-Mexico border: Pregnant woman from Guatemala dies after fall from wall,"US-Mexico Border: Pregnant Woman from Guatemala Dies After Fall from Wall

A 27-year-old pregnant woman from Guatemala died Sunday after falling from a section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Arizona, according to local authorities and advocacy groups.

The woman, whose identity is being withheld pending family notification, was part of a group of 19 migrants who were attempting to cross the border illegally, the Cochise County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The incident occurred near the Lukeville Port of Entry, about 110 miles southwest of Tucson.

According to the statement, the group was attempting to climb the border wall when the woman lost her footing and fell about 20 feet. She was rushed to a nearby hospital but did not survive her injuries. The other migrants in the group were arrested and turned over to U.S. Border Patrol agents.

The death comes as the number of migrants attempting to cross the border illegally has surged in recent months. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), more than 180,000 migrants were apprehended or encountered by Border Patrol agents in March, a 20-year high.

Advocacy groups and human rights organizations have expressed concern about the dangerous conditions that migrants face as they attempt to cross the border, particularly in remote and rugged areas like the one where the woman died.

""The border is not just a line on a map. It's a dangerous and deadly terrain that too many migrants are forced to cross,"" said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, a migrant rights group based in San Diego. ""This tragedy underscores the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform that prioritizes the safety and dignity of all people.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement that it was ""deeply saddened"" by the woman's death and that it was cooperating with local authorities in the investigation.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this difficult time,"" the statement said. ""We take seriously our mission to secure the border while treating everyone with dignity and respect.""

The incident also comes as the Biden administration has faced criticism from some immigration advocates over its handling of the surge in migrants at the border. While the administration has taken steps to roll back some of the more restrictive policies of the previous administration, such as ending the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) and expanding access to asylum, advocates say more needs to be done to address the root causes of migration and improve conditions at the border.

""The U.S. government has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of all people, regardless of their immigration status,"" said Guerrero. ""This tragedy is a reminder that we must do more to address the systemic issues that drive people to take these dangerous risks.""

The woman's death is the latest in a string of tragic incidents involving migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. In December, a 7-year-old migrant girl from Guatemala died after being detained by Border Patrol agents, and in May 2019, a father and daughter from El Salvador died after attempting to cross the Rio Grande River in Texas.

The woman's death is also the third reported death of a pregnant woman attempting to cross the border illegally in the past year, according to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner. In October 2020, a 26-year-old woman from Guatemala died after giving birth while in the custody of U.S. Border Patrol agents, and in January, a 20-year-old woman from El Salvador died after giving birth while in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The Cochise County Sheriff's Office said it was continuing to investigate the woman's death and that more information would be released as it became available. The woman's family has been notified of her death and is making arrangements to travel to the U.S., according to advocacy groups.

An Online Generation Redefines Mourning,"Title: ""An Online Generation Redefines Mourning""

In the digital age, the manner in which people express grief and remember the deceased has undergone a significant transformation. As the younger generations, often referred to as ""digital natives,"" continue to dominate the internet landscape, the traditional customs of mourning have been challenged and redefined.

Social media platforms, in particular, have emerged as a significant vehicle for expressing emotion and fostering a sense of community during times of loss. Instead of the traditional black-bordered obituary notices in newspapers, many families are now choosing to announce the passing of their loved ones on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. These digital memorials serve as a virtual gathering place for friends and family to share condolences, memories, and anecdotes, thereby creating a lasting digital legacy for the deceased.

One such example is the Facebook group, ""In Loving Memory of [Deceased's Name],"" which serves as a virtual memorial for individuals who have passed away. Members can post memories, photos, and condolences, while the administrator moderates the content to ensure it adheres to the group's guidelines. This digital space allows for a more personal and interactive form of mourning, as people can engage with one another in real-time, regardless of their geographical location.

The rise of digital mourning has also given way to the creation of new customs and traditions. For instance, ""digital candle-lighting"" has become a popular way for people to show their support for grieving families online. By clicking a virtual candle on a memorial website or social media post, individuals can express their sympathy and join a communal act of remembrance.

Another innovation in online mourning is the use of live-streamed funeral services. With the advent of technology like Zoom and Google Meet, families can invite friends and family members from around the world to participate in the funeral service, even if they are unable to attend in person due to travel restrictions or health concerns. This virtual attendance allows for a more inclusive and accessible form of mourning, as people can pay their respects without the need for travel or time off work.

However, the digitalization of mourning has also raised concerns about the impact on mental health and privacy. Some experts argue that the constant exposure to grief and loss online can lead to a heightened sense of despair and anxiety. Additionally, the public nature of online memorials can raise privacy concerns, as personal information and memories are shared with a potentially vast audience.

To address these concerns, it is essential that individuals approach digital mourning with care and sensitivity. This includes setting appropriate privacy settings on social media accounts, limiting the amount of time spent on mourning-related content, and seeking support from mental health professionals if needed.

In conclusion, the digital age has brought about a significant shift in the way people mourn and remember the deceased. While the benefits of digital mourning, such as increased accessibility and a sense of community, are undeniable, it is crucial that individuals approach this new form of mourning with caution and sensitivity. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that the customs and traditions surrounding mourning will continue to adapt and change, reflecting the values and needs of each new generation.",mistral
"In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism","Title: ""In 2017, Trump Revives Feminism, Saves Satire, and Reinvigorates Journalism""

In a surprising turn of events, the tumultuous political landscape of 2017 has inadvertently breathed new life into three crucial pillars of contemporary society: feminism, satire, and journalism.

The year began with the Women's March, a global demonstration of solidarity, which saw millions of people take to the streets in support of women's rights. While the march was primarily a response to the inauguration of President Donald Trump, it served as a catalyst for a resurgence of feminist activism.

Trump's presidency, with its controversial policies and rhetoric, has sparked a renewed interest in feminist ideology. The #MeToo movement, which gained momentum in 2017, is a testament to this resurgence. The movement, which encourages women to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, has not only brought attention to the widespread issue but has also inspired a new generation of feminists.

Satire, too, has found a renewed purpose in the Trump era. With the President's unconventional style and penchant for hyperbole, satirists have found fertile ground for their craft. Shows like ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" have seen a surge in viewership, as Americans turn to humor to cope with the political climate.

Moreover, satire has taken on a more significant role in public discourse. Late-night hosts, political cartoonists, and online satire websites have become crucial voices in the national conversation, providing a counterpoint to the often divisive political rhetoric.

Journalism, too, has been reinvigorated in 2017. With the rise of ""fake news"" and the erosion of trust in traditional media, journalists have had to work harder than ever to maintain their credibility. However, the challenges have also served as a catalyst for innovation.

News outlets have embraced digital platforms to reach wider audiences, and investigative journalism has seen a resurgence, with several high-profile investigations leading to significant political developments. The role of journalism as a watchdog and guardian of democracy has never been more important.

While the political landscape of 2017 has been marked by division and controversy, it has also served as a catalyst for positive change. The resurgence of feminism, the revitalization of satire, and the reinvigoration of journalism are reminders that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for progress.

As we move forward, it is important to remember that these shifts are not just reactions to the current administration but are part of a broader cultural evolution. The future of these pillars of society will depend on continued engagement, innovation, and a commitment to truth and justice.

In the end, it seems that, intentionally or not, President Trump has unwittingly contributed to the strengthening of these crucial aspects of society. Whether this is a legacy he intended to leave is uncertain, but its impact is undeniable. As we look to the future, it is essential to build on these positive changes and continue to work towards a more just, equitable, and informed society.",mistral
Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"Title: Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak, freeing up additional federal resources and funds to combat the pandemic.

The declaration, which comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global pandemic, grants the federal government expanded authority to address the crisis. Here's what the emergency declaration means:

1. Access to federal disaster funds: The emergency declaration allows states to receive federal funds to support emergency response efforts, such as building temporary hospitals, purchasing medical supplies, and increasing public health staff. This funding will help states that may not have the resources to respond effectively to the outbreak.

2. Waiver of federal regulations: The declaration allows the federal government to waive or modify certain federal regulations to speed up response efforts. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can waive certain licensing and certification requirements for healthcare professionals, allowing them to practice in areas where they are needed most.

3. Expansion of telehealth services: The declaration expands the use of telehealth services, allowing healthcare providers to offer remote consultations to patients, reducing the need for in-person visits and limiting the spread of the virus.

4. Increased production of medical supplies: The declaration enables the federal government to increase the production of medical supplies, such as respirators and protective equipment, which are in high demand as the virus spreads.

5. Suspension of federal regulations for air ambulances: The declaration suspends certain federal regulations for air ambulances, allowing them to transport patients more quickly and efficiently to hospitals that can provide the necessary care.

6. Flexibility for state and local governments: The declaration provides flexibility for state and local governments to respond to the outbreak, allowing them to reallocate resources and make decisions based on their unique needs.

7. Federal assistance to long-term care facilities: The declaration provides federal assistance to long-term care facilities, which have been particularly hard-hit by the virus, to help protect vulnerable residents and staff.

8. Coordination of private-sector resources: The declaration enables the federal government to coordinate the efforts of private-sector companies, such as manufacturers and technology firms, to help address the crisis.

It's important to note that the emergency declaration does not grant the federal government the power to mandate quarantines or lockdowns. Those decisions are left to state and local governments, who have the authority to issue such orders as they deem necessary.

The emergency declaration is a significant step in the federal government's response to the coronavirus outbreak, but it's just one part of a broader effort to contain the virus and protect the American people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to issue guidance on how individuals can protect themselves, and the administration is working closely with Congress to provide additional funding to address the crisis.

As the situation continues to evolve, it's crucial for Americans to stay informed and follow the guidance of public health officials. For the latest updates and information on the coronavirus outbreak, visit the CDC's website at <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html>.

Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"Title: ""Health Officials Often Turn to Praising Trump When Facing Tough Coronavirus Questions""

WASHINGTON — As the coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold, health officials have faced a barrage of questions from the media, the public, and lawmakers. In recent months, a pattern has emerged: when faced with challenging inquiries about the government's response to the crisis, these officials often pivot to praising President Donald Trump.

On numerous occasions, top health experts have lauded the president's leadership and expressed their confidence in his decision-making process during press briefings and congressional hearings. This tactic, while aimed at showing unity and support, has raised concerns among some observers who argue that it may detract from the seriousness of the situation and undermine the credibility of the officials themselves.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has been particularly vocal in his praise of the president. During a Senate hearing in May, Fauci commended Trump for his ""leadership"" and said that the president had provided ""excellent guidance"" on the pandemic response. Fauci has also repeatedly emphasized that the president listens to the advice of experts, a claim that has been backed up by officials such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield.

However, not all health officials have been as effusive in their praise of the president. During a House hearing in May, Dr. Deborah Birx, another member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was asked about her relationship with Trump. Birx replied, ""I've never had a day that I went to work and felt that the president was not interested in what I had to say."" She added, ""I think he's very committed to getting the job done.""

While Birx's testimony was generally positive, her response was more measured than that of Fauci. Some analysts suggest that this difference in tone reflects the varying levels of comfort that health officials have with publicly praising the president.

The practice of praising Trump when faced with tough questions has not gone unnoticed by the media and the public. Critics argue that it amounts to an attempt to curry favor with the president and may undermine the independence and objectivity of the health officials involved.

In a recent op-ed for The New York Times, Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, wrote that ""the constant praise of the president by Dr. Fauci and others is a mistake."" Jha argued that health officials should focus on providing accurate and actionable information, rather than trying to ingratiate themselves with the president.

Others have pointed out that the practice may also have practical consequences. For example, if health officials are too eager to praise the president, they may be less likely to offer critical feedback or challenge the administration's policies when necessary.

Despite these concerns, it's important to note that many health officials have praised Trump for his leadership during the pandemic. In a recent survey of over 1,000 medical professionals, 63% said they approved of the president's handling of the crisis, compared to just 38% of the general public.

In the end, the question of whether health officials should praise Trump when faced with tough coronavirus questions is a complex one. While it's understandable that officials may want to show support for the president, it's also important for them to maintain their independence and credibility. As the pandemic continues to unfold, this will be a crucial balancing act for health officials to navigate.",mistral
Holi celebrated with face masks and color explosions amid coronavirus fears,"Title: Holi Celebrated with Face Masks and Color Explosions Amid Coronavirus Fears

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the vibrant and joyous festival of Holi was celebrated across India and the diaspora this weekend, with a blend of tradition and precaution.

In a marked departure from previous years, the festivities were characterized by the ubiquitous presence of face masks, hand sanitizers, and social distancing measures. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) even urged participants to adopt safe practices to minimize the risk of virus transmission.

In Delhi's Laxmi Narayan Temple, one of the most famous venues for Holi celebrations, the mood was a mix of exuberance and apprehension. Worshippers and tourists alike were seen playing with colored powders, throwing water balloons, and dancing to the rhythm of traditional music, all while maintaining a safe distance and wearing masks.

Similar scenes were witnessed in other parts of India, including Mumbai, where the iconic Dhobi Ghat area was adorned with rainbow-colored laundry, despite the absence of the usual bustling crowd. In Kolkata, the bustling streets of North Kolkata, known for their lively Holi celebrations, saw a significantly diminished number of participants, but the spirit of the festival was undoubtedly present.

The new normal extended to the virtual sphere as well, with numerous online events and live streams organized to celebrate Holi. Bollywood stars, political leaders, and common people alike participated in these virtual festivities, spreading the message of unity and togetherness while adhering to social distancing guidelines.

While the pandemic has undeniably cast a shadow over the festivities, the resilience and adaptability of the Indian people were on full display. The spirit of Holi, which symbolizes the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, and the end of winter, was celebrated in a unique way this year, reflecting the nation's collective will to overcome adversity.

However, health experts have expressed concern over the potential for increased virus transmission during the festivities. Dr. Randeep Guleria, the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), urged people to avoid large gatherings and to wear masks at all times, even during the Holi celebrations.

As the world continues to navigate the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the way Holi was celebrated this year serves as a testament to the human spirit's ability to adapt and persevere. The festival, traditionally marked by the exchange of love and the breaking of barriers, took on a new meaning this year, symbolizing the collective struggle against an invisible enemy and the hope for a brighter, healthier future.

In the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ""Let us celebrate Holi with joy, but with caution."" As the nation moves towards a gradual return to normalcy, the lessons learned during this unique Holi season will undoubtedly shape the future of festival celebrations in India and beyond.",mistral
America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down,"Title: America Faces a New Normal as Coronavirus Outbreaks Show No Sign of Slowing Down

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the United States, health officials and policymakers are bracing for a prolonged battle against the virus. With no clear end in sight, Americans are being asked to adjust to a ""new normal"" that prioritizes safety and social distancing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported over 40,000 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in the U.S. to over 2.5 million. The surge in cases has led to a sharp increase in hospitalizations and deaths, with experts warning that the situation could worsen in the coming weeks.

In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, many states have reinstated restrictions on gatherings and non-essential businesses. This includes mask mandates, capacity limits, and closures of bars, gyms, and entertainment venues. Some cities and states have even imposed curfews and travel restrictions.

Despite these measures, health officials are concerned that Americans are not taking the virus seriously enough. Many people have been seen flouting social distancing guidelines and gathering in large groups, leading to outbreaks in bars, restaurants, and other public spaces.

""We are seeing a troubling trend,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert. ""If we don't get this under control, we're going to have a lot of pain and suffering.""

The economic impact of the pandemic has also been severe, with millions of Americans out of work and struggling to make ends meet. The federal government has provided some relief through stimulus packages and expanded unemployment benefits, but many experts warn that more needs to be done to support struggling families.

The political response to the pandemic has been divisive, with some politicians downplaying the severity of the virus and advocating for a quick reopening of the economy. This has led to a split between those who prioritize public health and those who prioritize economic growth.

President Donald Trump has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic, with many experts accusing him of downplaying the threat posed by the virus and failing to provide adequate leadership. The president has denied these accusations and insists that the U.S. is making progress in combating the virus.

""We're rounding the turn,"" Trump said during a press conference on Wednesday. ""We're going to be very strong, very soon.""

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, there are signs of hope. Vaccine trials are ongoing, and some experts believe that a vaccine could be available as early as next year. In the meantime, health officials are urging Americans to take simple precautions, such as wearing masks, washing hands, and practicing social distancing, to help slow the spread of the virus.

""We all want to get back to normal,"" said Dr. Fauci. ""But we need to do it in a way that is safe and responsible.""

As the U.S. grapples with the ongoing pandemic, it remains to be seen how long Americans will have to live with the ""new normal."" But for now, health officials and policymakers are urging caution and asking Americans to do their part in slowing the spread of the virus.

""We're all in this together,"" said Dr. Fauci. ""We need to work together to get through this.""",mistral
An Australian man dies in alleged ax attack near school after 'road rage' incident,"Title: **An Australian Man Dies in Alleged Axe Attack Near School After 'Road Rage' Incident**

SYDNEY – A shocking incident of road rage has left an Australian man dead, and authorities are investigating whether an axe attack was the cause.

The victim, identified as a 58-year-old man from the northern suburb of Warriewood, was found critically injured near Wakehurst Public School around 3:30 pm on Monday. Witnesses reported seeing the man being attacked with an axe before fleeing the scene.

Paramedics attended the scene, but the man died shortly after arrival at Northern Beaches Hospital. The school was placed on lockdown as a precaution while police investigated.

Detective Chief Inspector Brendan Gorman, from Northern Beaches Police Area Command, said the incident appeared to have started as a minor traffic dispute.

""At this stage, we believe there was some sort of road rage incident between two vehicles,"" Gorman said. ""We understand that the victim's vehicle collided with another vehicle, and that's when the alleged attack occurred.""

The alleged attacker, a 57-year-old man from the same suburb, was arrested at his home a short time later. He is currently in custody, assisting police with their inquiries.

Gorman appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident or has dashcam footage to come forward.

""We urge anyone who may have seen the vehicles involved or the incident itself to contact Crime Stoppers,"" he said. ""We are treating this as a serious matter, and we want to gather as much information as possible.""

The school principal, David Woolley, released a statement expressing condolences to the victim's family and reassuring the school community.

""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who lost his life today,"" Woolley said. ""The safety and wellbeing of our students and staff is our top priority, and we are working closely with the police to ensure the school remains a safe place.""

Community leaders have expressed shock and disbelief at the incident. Warriewood resident Sarah Thompson, who was dropping off her child at the school at the time, said she was ""devastated"" by the news.

""I can't believe something like this happened so close to home,"" Thompson said. ""It just goes to show that you never know what's going on behind the wheel of another car.""

The incident comes just weeks after a violent carjacking in Sydney's west, where a man was left fighting for his life after being beaten with a baseball bat. The growing number of road rage incidents has prompted calls for increased education and awareness about anger management and safe driving practices.

The investigation into the axe attack is ongoing, and police said they would provide further updates as the information becomes available. The identity of the victim will not be released until his family has been notified.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page: <https://nsw.crimestoppers.com.au/>. Information will be treated in strict confidence.",mistral
The Plot Against AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs vision feels eerily familiar,"Title: ""The Plot Against America's Vision Feels Eerily Familiar""

In the pantheon of historical fiction, HBO's adaptation of Philip Roth's ""The Plot Against America"" stands out as a chilling portrayal of an alternative past. Set during the 1940s, the series depicts a United States where Charles Lindbergh, rather than Franklin D. Roosevelt, wins the presidential election, aligning with Nazi Germany and plunging the nation into a darker timeline. As the series concluded last week, many viewers couldn't help but draw parallels between the fictional narrative and the current political climate.

Lindbergh's isolationist and anti-Semitic policies, which were central to the plot, have unsettling resonances in today's world. The character's rhetoric echoes some of the divisive language and beliefs that have emerged in recent years, leaving some audience members with a sense of unease.

""It's a reminder of how quickly things can change,"" said Dr. Sarah Church, a historian at New York University. ""The plot may be fictional, but the underlying themes are all too real. It's a cautionary tale about the dangers of demagoguery and the importance of standing up for our values.""

The series, directed by acclaimed filmmaker David Simon, is not just a warning about the past but also a commentary on the present. Simon, in an interview with Variety, spoke about his intent to create a work that was both entertaining and thought-provoking.

""I wanted to make a show that was engaging and entertaining, but also made people think about the world we live in,"" Simon said. ""I think 'The Plot Against America' does that. It's a story that's to some extent about the past, but it's also very much about the present.""

Indeed, the series has sparked numerous conversations about the state of American politics and society. Social media has been abuzz with discussions about the parallels between Lindbergh's policies and current political figures, as well as the implications of such policies if they were to be implemented.

""I think it's important for people to watch shows like this and think critically about the world we live in,"" said John Lee, a viewer from Los Angeles. ""It's a reminder that we need to stay vigilant and stand up for our values, no matter what.""

While the series is a work of fiction, its depiction of a darker timeline serves as a stark reminder of the importance of democracy and the rule of law. As the country navigates a complex political landscape, many are looking to history for guidance and understanding.

""'The Plot Against America' is a reminder that history can repeat itself if we're not careful,"" Dr. Church said. ""It's a call to action for all of us to stay informed, engaged, and vigilant.""

In the end, the series is more than just a gripping drama. It's a reflection of our society and a reminder of the dangers that lie in complacency and apathy. As the characters in ""The Plot Against America"" fight to protect their nation, viewers are left with a sense of urgency to do the same.

""I think the message of the show is clear: We need to stand up for what's right, no matter what,"" Lee said. ""We need to be vigilant and make sure that history doesn't repeat itself.""

As the United States continues to grapple with its political landscape, ""The Plot Against America"" serves as a timely and thought-provoking reflection of our society. Whether it's a warning from the past or a commentary on the present, the series is a reminder of the importance of democracy and the need for vigilance in a complex world.",mistral
90% of people are biased against women. That's the challenge we face,"Title: ""90% of People Are Biased Against Women: That's the Challenge We Face""

In a groundbreaking study published by the American Academy of Social Sciences, it has been revealed that an alarming 90% of individuals across various demographics and geographical locations exhibit some form of gender bias against women. The findings, meticulously researched over a six-year period, paint a stark portrait of the ongoing challenges women face in achieving equal footing in society.

The study, which surveyed over 60,000 participants from diverse backgrounds, aimed to assess the level of unconscious bias towards women in areas such as employment, politics, and personal relationships. The results, while daunting, serve as a clarion call for action, underscoring the need for concerted efforts to combat and eradicate these deeply ingrained prejudices.

The researchers found that the bias is not only prevalent but also subtle, often going unacknowledged by those who harbor it. This insidious form of bias, known as implicit bias, can manifest in the form of stereotypes, assumptions, and unconscious decision-making that can disadvantage women in numerous ways.

For instance, in the realm of employment, the study suggests that women are often viewed as less competent than their male counterparts, even when qualifications and experience are equal. This bias can lead to women being overlooked for promotions, paid less, and subjected to harsher performance evaluations.

In politics, the study reveals that women are more likely to face criticism and scrutiny than men, particularly in areas related to leadership and assertiveness. This bias can deter women from entering politics and hinder their progress once they are in office.

Personal relationships also remain a battleground for gender bias, with women often shouldering a disproportionate share of domestic responsibilities and facing gender-based violence. The study found that these biases are perpetuated by societal norms and cultural expectations, making them difficult to eradicate.

The study's authors stress that while the findings are disheartening, they also offer a roadmap for change. They call for targeted interventions, such as unconscious bias training, policy reform, and cultural shifts, to address and counteract these biases.

They also emphasize the importance of empowering women and amplifying their voices in all spheres of life. By creating spaces where women can thrive, challenge stereotypes, and showcase their talents, we can begin to dismantle the entrenched biases that hold them back.

The authors acknowledge that the journey towards gender equality is long and arduous, but they remain hopeful. They encourage individuals, communities, and governments to embrace this challenge, to challenge their own biases, and to work together to create a more equitable world for all.

As the world grapples with the stark reality of widespread gender bias, it is crucial to remember that this is not a problem that affects just women. It is a problem that affects us all, and it is a problem that we all have a role in solving. The 90% statistic is a call to action, a reminder that we must confront and overcome our biases if we are to create a more just and equitable society for everyone.",mistral
Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response,"Title: ""Lessons from Ebola: The Secret of Successful Epidemic Response""

In the face of global health crises, understanding and implementing effective response strategies is crucial. The Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016, which ravaged West Africa, offers valuable insights into successful epidemic management.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and various international organizations played pivotal roles in containing the Ebola outbreak. Their efforts, though delayed initially, ultimately led to the disease's suppression. The success story of Ebola response can be attributed to several key factors.

First and foremost, swift and decisive action was essential. The initial response to the Ebola outbreak was slow, allowing the disease to spread unchecked across borders. However, once the global community rallied, resources were quickly mobilized, and containment strategies were implemented. This rapid response prevented the outbreak from becoming a full-blown pandemic.

Effective communication and collaboration were also critical. The Ebola outbreak exposed the importance of clear, consistent, and culturally sensitive messaging. Local health workers, community leaders, and international organizations worked together to educate communities about the disease and promote safe practices. This collaboration ensured that accurate information reached the public, reducing fear and misinformation.

Another key factor was the deployment of trained healthcare workers. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the need for well-equipped and trained healthcare professionals in affected regions. These healthcare workers not only provided care to the sick but also played a vital role in contact tracing and isolation, thereby curtailing the spread of the disease.

Innovative technologies also played a significant role in the Ebola response. Mobile health apps were used to track cases, monitor contacts, and provide real-time data to healthcare workers. Drones were deployed for contactless delivery of medical supplies, reducing the risk of disease transmission. These technologies not only improved the efficiency of response efforts but also helped to protect the frontline workers.

However, the Ebola response was not without its challenges. Cultural and political barriers hindered the implementation of containment strategies in some areas. Misinformation and fear further complicated the response. Despite these challenges, the successful containment of Ebola offers valuable lessons for future epidemic responses.

The Ebola outbreak underscores the importance of swift action, effective communication, collaboration, trained healthcare workers, and innovative technologies in managing epidemics. By learning from the Ebola response, we can better prepare for and respond to future health crises, ensuring the safety and health of communities worldwide.

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the lessons from Ebola are more relevant than ever. By applying the strategies that worked in the Ebola response, we can hope to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and other future epidemics.

In conclusion, the Ebola outbreak offers a blueprint for effective epidemic response. By prioritizing swift action, effective communication, collaboration, trained healthcare workers, and innovative technologies, we can better manage future health crises and protect the global community.",mistral
McDonald's is making scented candles that smell like your favorite Quarter Pounder ingredients,"**McDonald's Ventures into Aromatherapy with Quarter Pounder Scented Candles**

In a bold and unprecedented move, fast-food giant McDonald's has announced the launch of a line of scented candles that mimic the tantalizing aroma of its iconic Quarter Pounder with Cheese. The new product aims to bring a piece of the beloved burger experience into homes, transcending the limits of traditional takeout.

The candles, set to hit the market this fall, are a collaboration between McDonald's and a prominent candle manufacturer. The partnership marks McDonald's entry into the fragrance industry, following the footsteps of other food brands that have successfully ventured into similar ventures, such as KFC's ""11 Herbs & Spices"" candle and Taco Bell's ""Cinnabon Delights"" scent.

The Quarter Pounder candles will reportedly feature a blend of savory beef, melted cheese, toasted bun, crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato. Each candle is designed to evoke the distinct and mouthwatering scent profile of the Quarter Pounder, promising to transport consumers to their favorite McDonald's dining room or drive-thru, albeit through a more unconventional means.

""We're excited to offer our customers a unique way to enjoy the McDonald's experience beyond our restaurants,"" said a McDonald's spokesperson. ""The Quarter Pounder candle is a fun and creative way for fans to engage with our brand and share a piece of the Quarter Pounder magic with their friends and family.""

The candles will be available in two sizes - a small, single-wick candle for personal use and a larger, three-wick candle ideal for larger spaces. McDonald's has also announced plans to release limited edition Quarter Pounder-scented air fresheners and room sprays.

The decision to launch scented products comes as part of McDonald's broader strategy to strengthen its brand identity and connect with customers on an emotional level. The fast-food chain has been investing heavily in digital platforms, customer experience, and product innovation to drive growth and maintain its position as a leading global food service provider.

While the Quarter Pounder candle is a novel concept, it remains to be seen how it will be received by consumers. Some have expressed enthusiasm, describing it as a clever and fun marketing strategy, while others have raised questions about the potential for sensory overload or the practicality of using a burger-scented candle in the home.

Regardless, the announcement has undoubtedly sparked intrigue and anticipation, with many eager to get their hands on a piece of the Quarter Pounder experience, even if it's just in candle form.

McDonald's has yet to reveal the exact release date or pricing for the Quarter Pounder candles, but more details are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. In the meantime, fans can look forward to savoring the aroma of their favorite burger without the calories.",mistral
What the 'Friends' reunion makes me hope for,"Title: ""What the 'Friends' Reunion Makes Me Hope For""

In a world where the pace of life often feels relentless and unforgiving, the announcement of a highly-anticipated reunion of one of television's most beloved sitcoms provides a welcome respite. The long-awaited ""Friends"" reunion, set to premiere on HBO Max, is more than just a nostalgic trip down memory lane; it is a symbol of hope for a return to simpler times, camaraderie, and shared joy.

The six-part unscripted special promises to take viewers behind the scenes of the iconic show, offering an intimate look at the cast, the creation of the show, and the enduring legacy it has left. As a fan of the series, I am eagerly looking forward to this reunion, not just for the nostalgia, but for the reminders of values and themes that the show embodied.

First and foremost, the ""Friends"" reunion reminds me of the power of friendship. The show, which spanned ten seasons from 1994 to 2004, followed the lives of six friends in New York City as they navigated love, loss, and life's many challenges together. Their friendship, marked by humor, support, and unconditional love, served as a beacon of hope during trying times, and it continues to do so today.

The reunion, I hope, will serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining strong connections with others. In a world where technology often distances us from our loved ones, the ""Friends"" reunion offers a chance to reflect on the value of face-to-face interaction, the power of laughter, and the healing balm of a good conversation.

Second, the reunion reminds me of the importance of embracing change. The ""Friends"" characters, while endearing in their quirks and idiosyncrasies, were not immune to the changes life throws our way. Characters grew, evolved, and sometimes made mistakes, but each change served to enrich their characters and the show as a whole.

In a world where change can feel overwhelming, the ""Friends"" reunion offers a reminder that change is inevitable and, often, necessary. It serves as a reminder that growth and transformation are not signs of failure, but rather opportunities for self-discovery and personal growth.

Finally, the reunion reminds me of the power of humor to heal and unite. The show's trademark wit and humor have provided countless moments of laughter and joy for viewers over the years. In a time of global uncertainty and divide, the reunion offers a chance to come together, if only for a moment, to share in the simple pleasure of laughter.

As the ""Friends"" reunion approaches, I am filled with anticipation and a renewed appreciation for the values and themes that the show embodied. I hope that the special will serve as a reminder of the importance of friendship, the need to embrace change, and the power of laughter to heal and unite.

In a world that often feels chaotic and divisive, the ""Friends"" reunion offers a glimpse of a simpler time, a time marked by laughter, camaraderie, and shared joy. And in that glimpse, I find hope. Hope for a return to those values, and hope for a future where we can once again come together, if only for a moment, to share in the simple pleasure of friendship.",mistral
Together we make a family,"Title: ""Together We Make a Family""

In the heart of a bustling city, a unique community is thriving, challenging traditional notions of family. This self-proclaimed ""family"" is not bound by blood or marriage, but by a shared belief in the power of love and acceptance.

The group, known as ""Together We Make a Family"" (TWMAF), was formed by a couple who felt the conventional path of building a family was not for them. After years of trying and failing to conceive, they turned to adoption, but found the process lengthy and restrictive. Frustrated but not defeated, they decided to create a family of their own, inviting others who shared their vision to join them.

""We wanted a family, a place where love and acceptance were the foundation,"" says the couple's spokesperson, Jane Doe. ""We found that in each other, and we hope to extend that to others.""

TWMAF is an intentional community, a concept that has gained traction in recent years. Members live together, share resources, and make decisions collectively. The group is diverse, consisting of couples, singles, and families from various backgrounds. They range in age from children to seniors, and hail from different parts of the world.

The group meets regularly for communal meals, discussions, and activities. They celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and milestones together, fostering a strong sense of community and camaraderie. They also engage in volunteer work, contributing to their city and helping those in need.

One of the most significant aspects of TWMAF is their approach to child-rearing. Children in the community are raised communally, with all members playing a role in their upbringing. This model allows for a broader perspective on child development, as each member brings their unique experiences and insights.

""Our children are not just our own,"" says Doe. ""They are the children of our community. We believe that by exposing them to different adults and ideas, we are preparing them for a world that is diverse and interconnected.""

While TWMAF has faced criticism and skepticism, the community remains undeterred. They argue that their model provides a safe, loving environment for children and offers an alternative to traditional family structures for those who may not fit into them.

""Family is not just about blood relations,"" says Doe. ""It's about love, support, and a shared commitment to each other. We've found that in each other, and we hope to inspire others to do the same.""

As TWMAF continues to grow, they are working towards creating a legal framework that recognizes their unique family structure. They hope that their story will inspire others to redefine what family means and to embrace the power of love and acceptance.

"It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President","Title: ""It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President""

In the face of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, a call for increased trust in scientific expertise and public health officials has been echoed across the nation. As the virus continues to spread, President Johnson's recent comments questioning the validity of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines have raised concerns among health experts and public officials.

During a press conference this week, President Johnson expressed skepticism towards the CDC's guidelines for social distancing, saying, ""I don't know if I believe two people at a table six feet apart is really going to make that big of a difference."" This statement, while seemingly innocuous, has sparked a wave of criticism from health professionals, who emphasize the importance of following scientific evidence in combating the pandemic.

""The CDC's guidelines are based on extensive research and data, and they are continually updated to reflect the latest understanding of the virus,"" said Dr. Sarah Williams, a leading epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""When a President questions the validity of these guidelines, it undermines public trust in the scientific community and makes it more difficult to control the spread of the virus.""

Dr. Williams' concerns are shared by many in the medical community. ""The CDC is the leading public health agency in the world, and their guidance is crucial in helping us navigate this pandemic,"" said Dr. Robert Anderson, the former chief of the CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention division. ""When the President questions their recommendations, it sends a dangerous message that science is not to be trusted.""

President Johnson's comments come at a critical time, as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States continues to rise. According to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, there have been over 30 million confirmed cases and over 560,000 deaths in the United States alone. Many health experts fear that the President's skepticism towards scientific guidance could lead to a spike in cases and further exacerbate the crisis.

""The CDC's guidelines are not just suggestions, they are based on the best available evidence and are designed to protect the public,"" said Dr. Williams. ""If we want to get this pandemic under control, we need to trust the experts and follow their guidance.""

In response to the criticism, the White House has issued a statement saying that the President's comments were taken out of context and that he has ""the utmost confidence in the CDC and the work they are doing."" However, many health experts remain concerned about the President's continued skepticism towards science and public health officials.

""We need strong leadership during this crisis, and that means listening to the experts and following their guidance,"" said Dr. Anderson. ""The President needs to recognize the critical role that science plays in combating the pandemic and work to build trust in the scientific community, rather than undermining it.""

As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is more important than ever that we trust the experts and follow their guidance. The CDC's recommendations are based on the best available evidence and are designed to protect the public. It is time for President Johnson to let the experts do their jobs and work towards a common goal: ending the pandemic and keeping Americans safe.",mistral
"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","**Title**: Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, Nation's Largest

**New York, NY - March 16, 2020**

As the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak continues to escalate in New York City, a growing chorus of parents, educators, and politicians are calling for the closure of the nation's largest school system to protect the health of students, staff, and the city's overall community.

The New York City Department of Education, which serves over 1.1 million students across 1,800 schools, has so far resisted calls to close, citing the need to provide continuity for families and maintain crucial services for vulnerable children. However, with the number of COVID-19 cases rising exponentially in the city, the pressure to take more drastic measures is mounting.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza have both stated that the city is not yet at the point where a school closure is necessary. In a press conference yesterday, de Blasio said, ""We're going to do everything we can to keep our schools open, but our first priority is the health and safety of all New Yorkers, especially our children.""

However, many parents and educators are skeptical that the city can effectively manage the virus's spread within the school system. ""It's only a matter of time before a teacher or student gets sick, and then we're looking at a full-blown outbreak in our schools,"" said Linda Hill, a teacher at PS 123 in Brooklyn.

The concern is not unfounded. Schools in other parts of the country have already seen closures due to COVID-19 cases, with Los Angeles and Seattle districts closing their doors to millions of students last week.

In addition to the risk of infection, many parents argue that keeping schools open forces them to make impossible choices between their jobs and the health of their families. ""I can't stay home with my kids if they're still in school, and I can't afford to lose my job,"" said Sarah Johnson, a single mother of two who works as a nurse. ""It's a lose-lose situation.""

Advocates for school closures also point to the potential for schools to serve as incubators for the virus, with children often unaware that they are infected and able to spread the disease to others. ""We know that children can carry the virus without showing symptoms, and we need to take every step possible to prevent that from happening in our schools,"" said Mark Naison, a professor of history and education at Fordham University.

School closures would not come without challenges, however. The city would need to provide alternative learning opportunities for students, such as online classes or take-home packets, and many parents would need to arrange for childcare during the closure.

The New York City Council is expected to hold a hearing this week to discuss the potential for school closures and the city's plans for handling the virus's spread within the school system. In the meantime, many parents and educators are urging the city to take more aggressive action to prevent a potential outbreak in the city's schools.

""We can't afford to wait until it's too late,"" said Hill. ""We need to take action now to protect our children and our communities.""",mistral
My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"Title: ""My Argument with Justice Antonin Scalia""

In an unusual turn of events, I found myself in a spirited debate with the late Justice Antonin Scalia during a dinner gathering last year. Our discussion, centered around the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and its relevance in modern times, was as engaging as it was thought-provoking.

The evening began with the usual pleasantries, but it wasn't long before the conversation turned to the subject that had consumed much of Scalia's professional life: constitutional law. As a fellow legal scholar, I was eager to hear his perspectives on current issues and challenges.

Scalia, a staunch originalist, argued that the Constitution should be interpreted based on its original meaning at the time of its ratification. He asserted that the founders' intent should guide judges in their decisions, and that they should not impose their personal or modern views on the text.

I, on the other hand, maintain that the Constitution is a living document, subject to evolving interpretations that reflect changing societal values and needs. I believe that the Constitution's meaning should not be static, but rather fluid and adaptable to the demands of the current era.

Our dialogue was animated, with each of us presenting our cases with passion and conviction. Scalia, with his signature wit and eloquence, was tireless in his defense of originalism. He argued that interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning ensures stability and predictability in the law.

I countered that a strict adherence to originalism can lead to outcomes that are out of step with contemporary values and needs. I cited examples of landmark cases where the Court's originalist interpretations have been criticized as outdated or narrow-minded.

Scalia's response was characteristically sharp. He pointed out that my arguments in favor of a more flexible interpretation of the Constitution were often based on subjective interpretations of societal values, which could vary widely among different groups and eras. He argued that originalism provided a more objective and consistent framework for interpreting the Constitution.

As the evening wore on, the debate became more nuanced. We discussed the role of judicial activism, the impact of political influences on the Court, and the challenges of interpreting a 230-year-old document in the context of a rapidly changing world.

In the end, our disagreement remained unresolved. But the conversation left a lasting impression on me. Scalia's intelligence, passion, and unwavering commitment to his beliefs were evident in every word he spoke. I was reminded that, at its core, the interpretation of the Constitution is a deeply philosophical and complex issue, one that requires ongoing debate and reflection.

As we bid our goodnights, Scalia and I agreed to continue our discussion at a later date. I hope that our exchange will serve as a reminder that, even in a polarized world, it is still possible to engage in respectful and enlightening dialogue about the issues that matter most.

In the days following our conversation, I found myself returning to our debate, revisiting the arguments we had made, and considering the merits of both originalism and the living Constitution. I am still undecided, but I am grateful for the opportunity to have engaged in such a meaningful and thought-provoking discussion with one of the greatest legal minds of our time.",mistral
How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution,"Title: How NASA's Apollo program kick-started Silicon Valley's tech revolution

In the annals of American history, few events have had as profound an impact on the nation's cultural and economic landscape as the Apollo moon landing. While the historic event of July 20, 1969, captivated a global audience, the ripple effects of this milestone extended far beyond the applause and tears that marked Neil Armstrong's ""one small step."" A closer look reveals the unexpected corner of America that would find itself transformed by the Apollo program: Silicon Valley.

The seeds of Silicon Valley's tech revolution were sown during the height of the Cold War, as the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a fierce space race. The Apollo program, initiated in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, aimed to send astronauts to the moon before the end of the decade. To achieve this goal, NASA needed an army of engineers, scientists, and mathematicians to develop the complex technologies necessary for human spaceflight.

As the Apollo program ramped up, the demand for skilled labor in aerospace engineering skyrocketed. The region around Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, offered a unique blend of academic institutions, a vibrant research culture, and a temperate climate—making it an attractive destination for the influx of Apollo-related jobs.

One of the first waves of talent to arrive in the area was a group of engineers who had worked on the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) at MIT. Known as the ""traitorous eight,"" these engineers left their positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to join a startup called Fairchild Semiconductor, which was located in the heart of Palo Alto.

The arrival of the ""traitorous eight"" marked the beginning of a brain drain from the East Coast to the West Coast. As more and more aerospace companies followed NASA to California, the region began to attract a growing number of entrepreneurs and investors. These individuals saw tremendous opportunities in the burgeoning Silicon Valley, and they began to invest in the development of new technologies and companies.

One such entrepreneur was Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corporation. Moore's groundbreaking 1965 paper, ""Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits,"" predicted that the number of transistors that could be placed on an integrated circuit would double approximately every two years. This trend, now known as Moore's Law, has driven the rapid advancement of computing technology for the past six decades.

Another key figure in the Silicon Valley tech revolution was Robert Noyce, a former Fairchild employee who co-founded Intel with Moore in 1968. Noyce is widely recognized as the ""mayor of Silicon Valley"" for his role in fostering the growth of the region's tech industry. He also played a crucial role in the development of the integrated circuit, which has been the backbone of the modern computer age.

The Apollo program's influence on Silicon Valley extended beyond engineering talent and entrepreneurship. The demand for miniaturized, high-reliability electronics to power spacecraft drove the development of integrated circuits, microprocessors, and personal computers. These technologies, in turn, enabled the creation of new industries and products that have reshaped countless aspects of our daily lives.

The internet, for example, can trace its roots back to the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), which was developed by the Department of Defense in the late 1960s. The network's goal was to create a decentralized communication system that could withstand a nuclear attack. The pioneering work of ARPANET laid the foundation for the internet as we know it today, which has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and learn.

The Apollo program's impact on Silicon Valley is evident in the countless companies that have emerged from the region over the past six decades. Google, Apple, Cisco Systems, and Oracle are just a few examples of the tech giants that have originated in Silicon Valley, thanks in part to the influx of talent and resources brought by the Apollo program.

"I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me","Title: ""I'm Chronically Ill, and This Is What Congress Can Do to Protect Me""

In the United States, an estimated 60 million people live with a chronic illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These individuals, including myself, navigate a complex web of medical treatments, insurance challenges, and social stigmas daily. As the 117th Congress convenes, it has an opportunity to address the needs of this large and often overlooked population.

First, Congress should prioritize the passage of the Patients' Rights to Know Drug Prices Act. This legislation would require drug manufacturers to disclose the prices of their medications to the public, including Medicare and Medicaid. For chronically ill patients, the high cost of medications can be a significant financial burden, often leading to difficult choices between paying for essential drugs and other necessities like food or rent.

Another critical issue is the need for comprehensive healthcare reform. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), while a step in the right direction, has left millions of Americans without access to affordable healthcare. Congress should work towards a bipartisan solution that expands healthcare coverage, ensures affordable premiums, and protects pre-existing condition protections.

Additionally, Congress should address the issue of medical debt, which disproportionately affects chronically ill patients. The Medical Debt Relief Act, introduced in the previous Congress, would establish a process for bankruptcy courts to wipe out qualifying medical debt, providing relief for those struggling under the weight of extraordinary medical expenses.

Moreover, Congress should invest in research for chronic diseases. Chronic illnesses are the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S., yet research funding for these conditions lags behind that of more rare and acute diseases. Increased funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could lead to breakthroughs in treatment and prevention strategies.

Furthermore, Congress should address the issue of mental health. Chronic physical illness often comes with a high emotional toll, and many chronically ill patients struggle with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, while a step in the right direction, has not been fully enforced, leaving many patients without equal access to mental health services.

Lastly, Congress should focus on increasing access to affordable, high-quality home healthcare. For many chronically ill patients, home healthcare allows them to maintain their independence while receiving necessary care. However, reimbursement rates for home healthcare services are often lower than those for institutional care, making it difficult for providers to offer these services.

In conclusion, the 117th Congress has the opportunity to make a significant difference in the lives of the millions of Americans living with chronic illness. By prioritizing affordable drug prices, comprehensive healthcare reform, medical debt relief, increased research funding, mental health parity, and accessible home healthcare, Congress can help ensure that chronically ill patients receive the care and support they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives.",mistral
South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation,"Title: South Africans in Wuhan Lockdown Call for Evacuation

WUHAN, China – As the deadly coronavirus outbreak continues to spread, South Africans living in Wuhan have appealed to their government for immediate evacuation. The South African community, numbering in the dozens, has been trapped in the epicenter of the virus since its outbreak in December.

""We are scared, we are worried, and we just want to go home,"" said Jabulani Nkosi, a South African student studying at Wuhan University. Nkosi, along with his fellow countrymen, has been confined to their residences since the city was locked down on January 23.

The South African government, however, has yet to respond to the pleas for evacuation. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) stated that it is closely monitoring the situation and is in regular contact with the South African community in Wuhan.

""The safety and wellbeing of South Africans abroad is our utmost priority,"" said DIRCO spokesperson, Clayson Monyela. ""We are closely monitoring the situation and are in regular contact with our embassy in Beijing and the South African community in Wuhan.""

The South African embassy in Beijing has been providing support and assistance to the South African community in Wuhan. This includes distributing food and essential supplies, as well as providing psychological support.

The South African government has also advised its citizens to delay non-essential travel to China, particularly to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the coronavirus a global health emergency, with cases reported in over 20 countries.

The coronavirus, officially named 2019-nCoV, has already claimed over 130 lives and infected thousands more in China. The virus, which originated in a seafood market in Wuhan, has spread rapidly across China and beyond, causing widespread panic and disruption.

The South African government's reluctance to evacuate its citizens has raised concerns among the South African community in Wuhan. ""We understand the risks involved, but we feel that the South African government should do more to help us,"" said Nkosi.

Meanwhile, the South African government has been praised for its swift response in screening passengers arriving from China at major airports. As of February 3, over 1,300 passengers have been screened, with no confirmed cases of the coronavirus reported in South Africa.

The South African government has also set up a hotline for South Africans in China to seek assistance and advice. The hotline, which is operated by the DIRCO, can be reached at +27 12 351 1000.

As the coronavirus outbreak continues to evolve, the South African community in Wuhan remains hopeful that their government will take action to evacuate them. ""We just want to go home,"" said Nkosi. ""We miss our families, our friends, and our country.""

In conclusion, South Africans living in Wuhan have appealed to their government for immediate evacuation as the deadly coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. The South African government has yet to respond to the pleas for evacuation, but has advised its citizens to delay non-essential travel to China and has set up a hotline for assistance. The South African community in Wuhan remains hopeful that their government will take action to bring them home.",mistral
Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates

New York — Major U.S. stock indexes rebounded on Tuesday, following a historic plunge last week, as investors digested the latest economic data and company earnings reports.

At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 653.56 points, or 2.13%, to 31,395.23. The S&P 500 climbed 88.77 points, or 2.22%, to reach 4,044.43, while the Nasdaq Composite added 324.64 points, or 2.81%, to end the day at 11,811.17.

The market's recovery comes after a sharp sell-off last week, triggered by concerns over rising inflation, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and the impact of the Omicron variant on the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst weekly percentage drop since March 2020, with a loss of 9.8%.

Investors seemed to find solace in positive economic data released earlier in the day. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported its manufacturing index rose to 60.7% in December, up from 60.4% in November, marking the 11th consecutive month of expansion. The ISM's services index also increased to 62.9% in December, from 62.1% in November, suggesting continued growth in the service sector.

""Today's data shows that the U.S. economy is still on solid ground, despite the recent market volatility,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""Investors are starting to look beyond the near-term uncertainty and focus on the longer-term potential for growth.""

Additionally, several companies reported stronger-than-expected earnings, which helped buoy the market. Technology giant Apple reported a 16.9% increase in quarterly revenue, while consumer goods company Procter & Gamble beat analysts' estimates for both earnings and revenue.

However, concerns about the Omicron variant and its potential impact on economic recovery remained a pressing issue for investors. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Tuesday that the variant has been detected in at least 89 countries, with the number of cases continuing to rise.

""The market is still trying to gauge the severity of the Omicron variant and its impact on global economic growth,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ""Until we have more data, there will likely be some volatility in the market.""

Despite the market's rebound, some analysts warned that the recent volatility could continue in the coming weeks.

""Investors should be prepared for more market swings as we move into the new year,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""However, it's important to remember that volatility is a normal part of investing, and it presents opportunities for those who are able to remain disciplined and focused on their long-term goals.""

As the day drew to a close, investors seemed to be taking a more optimistic view of the market, with many pointing to the potential for continued economic growth in 2022.

""Despite the recent volatility, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong,"" said strategist Julian Emanuel of BTIG. ""As long as the Fed is able to strike the right balance between fighting inflation and supporting economic growth, the market has the potential to continue its recovery in the new year.""

Asking yourself 'What's the meaning of life?' may extend it,"Title: ""Asking 'What's the Meaning of Life?' May Extend It""

In a surprising twist, a recent study suggests that pondering the meaning of life may have a direct impact on its duration. The research, conducted by a team of psychologists at the University of California, Berkeley, sheds new light on the connection between existential questioning and lifespan.

The study, published in the journal ""Psychology and Aging,"" involved over 10,000 participants aged 52 and older. Participants were asked a series of questions designed to measure their existential well-being, including their sense of purpose, their level of engagement with life, and their preoccupation with the big questions, such as the meaning of life itself.

The results were striking. Those who reported a stronger sense of purpose and a greater preoccupation with existential questions were found to have a lower risk of death from all causes, compared to those who reported less existential well-being. The effect was especially strong for those who reported a sense of purpose in life but had not actively sought out answers to the big questions.

Dr. Jane Chen, the lead researcher on the study, explained, ""Our findings suggest that having a sense of purpose in life, even if you don't have all the answers, may be beneficial for your health and longevity. It's not so much about finding the meaning of life as it is about finding a reason to live.""

The researchers believe that the benefits of existential questioning may be due to a variety of factors. For one, having a sense of purpose and engagement in life may lead to healthier lifestyle choices, such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding harmful behaviors like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, having a sense of purpose may reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, all of which are associated with a higher risk of premature death.

The study also found that the benefits of existential questioning were not limited to any particular demographic group. Participants from all backgrounds, including those with and without formal education, reported similar benefits from having a sense of purpose and engaging in existential questioning.

Dr. Chen cautioned that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the connection between existential questioning and longevity. However, she encouraged individuals to reflect on their purpose in life and to engage in thoughtful, meaningful pursuits. ""Life is a journey, and finding your own purpose and meaning is an important part of that journey,"" she said.

The study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that a positive mindset and a sense of purpose can have significant benefits for physical and mental health. Previous research has linked a sense of purpose to better cardiovascular health, reduced risk of dementia, and improved resilience in the face of stress and adversity.

While the study does not necessarily provide a definitive answer to the question of life's meaning, it does suggest that engaging in existential questioning may have its own rewards, both for our well-being and our longevity. As Dr. Chen put it, ""Life is a mystery, and it's up to each of us to find our own answers. But in the process, we may just find that the journey is more important than the destination.""",mistral
New packaging and plant-based fish: How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback,"Title: New Packaging and Plant-Based Offerings: Bumble Bee Tuna's Strategic Rebranding

In an industry grappling with shifting consumer preferences, sustainability concerns, and fierce competition, Bumble Bee Foods, a leading tuna brand, is making a bold move to reposition itself in the market. The company, once synonymous with canned tuna, is unveiling a comprehensive strategy that includes innovative packaging, a plant-based fish alternative, and a renewed focus on sustainability.

The cornerstone of Bumble Bee's revitalization effort is its revolutionary new packaging. The company has partnered with a leading packaging solutions provider to create a breakthrough design that promises to extend the shelf life of its tuna products by up to 50%. This extended shelf life not only reduces waste but also ensures a consistent product quality, a concern often raised by consumers.

The new packaging is part of a larger, more sustainable production process. Bumble Bee has committed to sourcing 100% of its tuna from pole-and-line and troll-caught fisheries by 2025. These methods, which are considered more selective and less destructive than other fishing practices, are expected to significantly reduce the brand's environmental footprint.

However, Bumble Bee is not resting on its sustainability efforts alone. Recognizing the growing demand for plant-based options, the company has developed a plant-based fish alternative. Dubbed ""SeaBreeze,"" the product is made from a proprietary blend of plant proteins and is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. The new offering aims to appeal to vegetarians, vegans, and flexitarians, as well as those concerned about the environmental impact of traditional tuna fishing.

Bumble Bee's CEO, Jan Tharp, expressed her confidence in the new strategy, stating, ""We understand that consumer preferences are evolving, and we are committed to meeting those changes head-on. Our new packaging, our commitment to sustainable fishing, and the launch of SeaBreeze are all part of our larger vision to make Bumble Bee a brand for everyone.""

The company's rebranding efforts are not without challenges. The tuna industry has been facing declining consumption rates, partially due to health and environmental concerns. Moreover, the plant-based market is highly competitive, with established players like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods dominating the landscape.

Despite these challenges, Bumble Bee is optimistic about its future. Tharp emphasized, ""We are a resilient company with a rich history. We are investing in innovation, sustainability, and our customers. We believe that these investments will help us regain our position as a leader in the seafood industry.""

As Bumble Bee prepares to roll out its new products and initiatives, the company's success will be closely watched by industry observers. Whether Bumble Bee's strategic rebranding will be enough to reverse its fortunes remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: the future of Bumble Bee Tuna is far from canned.",mistral
Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,"Title: Discarded Photo Negatives Show China in an Era of Change

In the heart of Beijing, amidst the bustling metropolis, a trove of history was unearthed in a dusty attic. A collection of over 5,000 photographic negatives, forgotten and discarded, have offered a unique, intimate glimpse into China's transformative past.

The negatives, dating back to the 1950s and 1960s, were discovered by a local antique dealer, who purchased the attic and its contents from the elderly owner. The dealer, intrigued by the collection, decided to share the find with the National Film Archive of China.

""These negatives are a treasure trove,"" said Dr. Li Wei, the director of the National Film Archive. ""They provide a rare, firsthand account of life in China during a time of significant change and upheaval.""

The photographs capture moments of everyday life, from bustling city streets and rural landscapes to intimate family portraits and candid street scenes. They offer a stark contrast to the carefully curated images often associated with China during this period.

One particularly poignant series of images depicts the construction of the Great Wall, a symbol of China's ancient past. Workers, dressed in traditional garb, labor alongside modern machinery, a testament to the blending of tradition and progress.

Another series captures the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, with its empty, desolate streets and the remnants of destroyed buildings. The images offer a somber reminder of the tumultuous period and the human toll it took.

However, the negatives also reveal moments of joy and celebration. Wedding photos, graduation portraits, and images of children playing in the streets, despite the hardships, show a resilient spirit that endures.

The National Film Archive plans to digitalize the collection and make it publicly available. Dr. Li hopes that the images will not only serve as a historical record but also spark interest and conversation about China's past.

""These photos are not just historical artifacts,"" Dr. Li said. ""They are stories of ordinary people living through extraordinary times. They remind us of our past, but they also tell us something about our present and our future.""

The discovery of these discarded photo negatives serves as a reminder that history is often found in the most unexpected places. As China continues to evolve, these images offer a valuable perspective on the country's past and the power of photography to capture and preserve our shared history.",mistral
Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates

New York - Wall Street staged a significant rebound on Thursday, with major indices regaining some of the losses from the previous day's historic plunge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) surged by over 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also posted strong gains.

The recovery comes after the market witnessed its worst day since the 2008 financial crisis on Wednesday, with the DJIA plummeting more than 2,997 points. The sell-off was spurred by fears of a global economic slowdown, driven by the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.

At the close of trading on Thursday, the DJIA stood at 23,185.62, up 4.11 percent for the day. The S&P 500 climbed 4.90 percent to finish at 2,746.56, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 5.24 percent to end the day at 7,475.16.

The rebound comes as investors digest a series of policy measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the virus. The Federal Reserve announced an emergency interest rate cut of 0.50 percentage points on Tuesday, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the administration is preparing a $1 trillion economic stimulus package.

Investors also appeared to be buoyed by signs of slowing new cases of the coronavirus in China, where the outbreak first emerged. The National Health Commission reported just 327 new cases on Thursday, down from more than 15,000 at the peak of the outbreak.

""The market is obviously responding to a combination of factors, including the Fed's rate cut and the slowing of new cases in China,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. ""But it's important to remember that the coronavirus is still a very real threat, and we could see more volatility in the days and weeks ahead.""

Other market-moving news included the announcement of a potential treatment for the coronavirus by Gilead Sciences. Shares of the biotech company surged by more than 10 percent on Thursday, leading the way among the DJIA's 30 components.

In corporate news, Boeing continued its slide, with shares falling another 5.7 percent. The embattled aircraft manufacturer has been grappling with the grounding of its 737 Max jet, which has been involved in two fatal crashes in the past year.

Meanwhile, shares of Tesla soared by more than 12 percent, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. The electric car maker also announced a 5-for-1 stock split, which will take effect on August 31st.

Looking ahead, investors will be keeping a close eye on the ongoing developments related to the coronavirus outbreak, as well as the progress of the economic stimulus package. The next major catalyst for the market will be the release of the January jobs report on Friday, which analysts expect to show a continued slowdown in job growth.

In Europe, markets also posted strong gains on Thursday, with the FTSE 100 in London rising by 4.6 percent, the DAX in Frankfurt climbing 5.4 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris gaining 5.0 percent.

Asian markets were mixed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising by 5.1 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite fell by 0.2 percent.

In currency markets, the U.S. dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, while oil prices continued their rebound, with West Texas Intermediate crude up by more than 5 percent to $51.50 per barrel.

In conclusion, Wall Street staged a significant rebound on Thursday, with major indices regaining some of the losses from the previous day's historic plunge. The recovery comes as investors digest a series of policy measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. However, with the virus still a very real threat, investors should expect more vol",mistral
Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"Title: Democrats' Only Choice is to Impeach Trump

Washington, D.C. - As the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine gathers momentum, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers are advocating for the president's impeachment.

The impeachment inquiry, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was sparked by a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The complaint also suggested that the White House withheld military aid to Ukraine as leverage.

While the inquiry is still ongoing, several Democratic lawmakers have stated that the evidence gathered so far is sufficient to impeach the president.

""The evidence is overwhelming and the president's actions are a clear abuse of power,"" said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a press conference. ""If we don't impeach him, we are condoning this behavior and setting a dangerous precedent for future presidents.""

Representative Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, echoed Ocasio-Cortez's sentiments. ""The president's actions are a direct threat to our democratic institutions and the rule of law,"" he said. ""If we do not hold him accountable, we are failing in our duty to protect the American people.""

The potential impeachment of Trump would mark only the third time in U.S. history that a president has been impeached. The first two impeachments, of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and President Bill Clinton in 1998, both resulted in acquittal by the Senate.

However, the Democrats have a stronger case against Trump than they did against either Johnson or Clinton. While both Johnson and Clinton were accused of obstruction of justice, Trump's actions in regards to Ukraine appear to be a clear abuse of power for personal and political gain.

If the House votes to impeach Trump, the Senate would then hold a trial to determine whether to remove him from office. A two-thirds majority would be required for conviction and removal. Given the current Republican majority in the Senate, it is unlikely that Trump would be removed from office.

However, a successful impeachment would still have significant political consequences. Even if Trump is not removed from office, the impeachment process would further tarnish his reputation and make it more difficult for him to govern effectively.

In addition, an impeachment would likely boost the Democrats' chances in the 2020 elections. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University found that 52% of voters support impeachment and removal, while only 43% oppose it.

Despite the growing calls for impeachment, some Democratic lawmakers have expressed reservations about the process. Representative Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, has said that the party should focus on winning the 2020 elections rather than impeaching Trump.

""The American people are tired of the constant drama and they want us to focus on the issues that matter to them,"" Clyburn said. ""We need to keep our eye on the ball and make sure we win back the White House and the Senate.""

Other Democrats have argued that an impeachment would be politically risky and could backfire on the party. ""We need to be very careful about how we proceed,"" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries. ""If we rush to judgment, we could end up alienating voters and giving Trump a boost in the polls.""

Despite these concerns, the momentum for impeachment appears to be growing. With the Democrats' only chance of removing Trump from office likely through impeachment, it seems increasingly likely that the House will vote to impeach the president in the coming weeks.

Whether the Senate will convict and remove Trump remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's dealings with Ukraine has the potential to fundamentally alter the course of American politics and have lasting consequences for years to come.",mistral
The real terror threat in America is homegrown,"Title: ""The Real Terror Threat in America is Homegrown""

In the face of ongoing global conflicts and international terrorism, the United States has been grappling with a growing threat closer to home: homegrown terrorism. According to a recent report by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), the number of homegrown terrorism cases in the U.S. has surged in the past decade.

Homegrown terrorism, also known as self-radicalization, refers to individuals radicalizing within the United States without direct external guidance from foreign terrorist organizations. These individuals often utilize social media platforms to spread propaganda and recruit new members.

The FBI's 2021 National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin highlighted that homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) ""continue to pose a persistent and evolving threat to the United States."" The bulletin specifically noted the increased threat from domestic violent extremists (DVEs), who are motivated by a range of ideologies, including white supremacist extremism, anti-government sentiment, and Islamist extremism.

The rise of online extremist groups and forums has played a significant role in the proliferation of homegrown terrorism. These platforms allow individuals to connect with like-minded individuals, share ideologies, and plan attacks without geographical limitations.

One of the most high-profile cases of homegrown terrorism in recent years was the 2019 El Paso Walmart shooting. The shooter, a 21-year-old man, allegedly posted a manifesto online, expressing white supremacist beliefs before carrying out the attack that left 23 people dead.

While the majority of homegrown terrorism cases in the U.S. are linked to Islamist extremism, the increase in DVEs has become a growing concern for law enforcement agencies. The FBI's 2020 HVE Threat Report states that DVEs accounted for 63% of all HVE cases in 2019.

The federal government has acknowledged the rise of homegrown terrorism and has taken steps to address the issue. In 2021, the Biden administration announced a comprehensive strategy to counter domestic terrorism, which includes enhancing information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and increasing resources for community engagement and outreach.

However, experts caution that the rise of homegrown terrorism is a complex issue with no easy solutions. Researchers at START argue that a multi-faceted approach is needed, including addressing the root causes of extremism, improving intelligence gathering and analysis, and increasing community partnerships.

In response to the increase in homegrown terrorism, many communities have also taken steps to prevent radicalization and promote tolerance. Grassroots organizations have sprung up across the country, providing resources for individuals at risk of radicalization and promoting dialogue between different communities.

The rise of homegrown terrorism in America is a sobering reminder that the threat of terrorism is not confined to foreign battlefields. As the U.S. continues to grapple with this growing threat, a comprehensive and collaborative approach will be essential in protecting our communities and safeguarding our nation's security.",mistral
The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"Title: The Real Story Behind Those Planned Parenthood Videos

In a series of undercover videos released over the past year, Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) has been under scrutiny for allegedly selling fetal tissue for profit. The videos, produced by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), have sparked national outrage, leading to multiple congressional investigations and calls for defunding the organization.

However, a closer examination of the videos and the methods used by CMP raises questions about the legitimacy of the footage and the motivations behind its release.

The videos, which were secretly recorded during meetings between Planned Parenthood officials and CMP operatives posing as representatives of a biotech company, show Planned Parenthood staff discussing the potential use and payment for fetal tissue donations. Critics argue that these discussions suggest illegal activity, while Planned Parenthood maintains that they are simply discussing the logistics of the donation process, which is both legal and ethical.

In response to the controversy, several states have moved to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, arguing that the organization's actions are a violation of federal laws prohibiting the sale of fetal tissue. However, it is important to note that federal law allows for the reimbursement of reasonable costs associated with the donation process, such as transportation and storage. Planned Parenthood has stated that it only receives reimbursement for these costs, and has never sold fetal tissue for profit.

The legitimacy of the videos has also been called into question. CMP, the group responsible for producing the videos, has a history of creating undercover sting operations targeting the abortion industry. The group's founder, David Daleiden, has been involved in similar projects in the past, and has been accused of manipulating and editing footage to create a misleading narrative.

In a recent interview, Daleiden admitted to using a fake driver's license and a false identity to gain access to Planned Parenthood facilities. He also admitted to filming the meetings without the knowledge or consent of the Planned Parenthood officials. These actions raise serious ethical concerns and call into question the validity of the footage.

Planned Parenthood has also accused CMP of using deceptive editing tactics to create a misleading portrayal of the organization. For example, in one video, Planned Parenthood officials are shown discussing the use of a ""less crunchy"" procedure for fetal tissue donation. Critics argue that this implies a willingness to alter the procedure to obtain better quality tissue, while Planned Parenthood maintains that they were simply discussing the use of a less invasive procedure that would be less traumatic for the patient.

The controversy surrounding the videos has had a significant impact on Planned Parenthood, with multiple states moving to defund the organization. However, it is important to remember that the legitimacy of the footage has been called into question, and that Planned Parenthood has maintained that it has never sold fetal tissue for profit.

As the investigations into the videos continue, it is crucial that we approach the issue with a fair and objective perspective. The allegations against Planned Parenthood are serious, but it is important to ensure that the facts are accurately presented and that the law is being followed. Only then can we make informed decisions about the future of Planned Parenthood and the important services it provides to millions of Americans.",mistral

Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"Title: Elon Musk's Brother Pursues Agri-Tech Venture to Revolutionize Farming

Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of tech mogul Elon Musk, has set his sights on the agricultural sector, aiming to revolutionize farming through a combination of sustainable practices and innovative technology. Musk, an entrepreneur with a background in restaurant management, has co-founded two companies, Square Roots and Big Green, which focus on urban farming and school gardens, respectively.

Musk's latest venture, Square Roots, operates a high-tech indoor farming facility in Brooklyn, New York. The company uses hydroponic systems to grow a variety of leafy greens, herbs, and microgreens year-round without the need for soil or pesticides. The controlled environment allows for precise temperature, light, and nutrient management, resulting in faster growth and higher yields compared to traditional farming methods.

Square Roots' mission is twofold: to provide fresh, locally-grown produce to consumers while reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. The company's indoor farming model significantly decreases water usage and eliminates the need for harmful chemicals, making it a more sustainable alternative to conventional farming practices.

Musk's other venture, Big Green, aims to bring gardens to schools across the United States. The company partners with schools to design, build, and maintain outdoor learning spaces that incorporate gardens, raised beds, and educational signage. The goal is to teach students about the importance of healthy eating, environmental stewardship, and the science behind plant growth.

Musk believes that by combining sustainable farming practices with technology, it is possible to feed a growing population while minimizing the negative environmental impacts of agriculture. He sees his work as a natural extension of his brother's focus on disruptive technologies and a way to address one of the world's most pressing challenges: feeding a global population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050.

The agricultural sector has traditionally been slow to adopt new technologies, but Musk believes that the time for change is now. He points to the increasing demand for locally-grown, organic produce and the growing awareness of the environmental impact of agriculture as evidence that there is a market for more sustainable farming solutions.

Musk's ventures have garnered attention from investors, including the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures, which has provided funding for both Square Roots and Big Green. The company's innovative approach to farming and its focus on sustainability have attracted a dedicated following, with consumers eager to support a more environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional agriculture.

As Musk continues to develop and expand his agri-tech ventures, he hopes to inspire others to join him in his mission to revolutionize farming. He sees a future where technology and sustainability work hand-in-hand to feed the world in a way that is both good for people and good for the planet.

In an interview, Musk said, ""We have the technology and the knowledge to create a more sustainable food system. It's up to us to bring these solutions to scale and make a real difference in the world.""

With his brothers' fame and fortune casting a long shadow, Kimbal Musk has carved out a unique niche for himself in the world of agriculture. His commitment to sustainability, innovation, and education has made him a leader in the agri-tech movement and a force to be reckoned with in the world of farming.

As the global population continues to grow and the demand for food increases, Musk's work has never been more important. By harnessing the power of technology and the principles of sustainability, Musk is helping to pave the way for a more resilient and sustainable food system for generations to come.",mistral
Which generation has it worse? (Opinion),"Title: ""Which Generation Has It Worse? (Opinion)""

In the ever-evolving landscape of modern society, the question of which generation bears the heavier burden of challenges has become a topic of heated debate. As each generation experiences unique trials and triumphs, it is essential to examine the distinct adversities faced by each cohort and assess their relative impact.

Beginning with the Baby Boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, this generation has weathered numerous historical events, including the Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the Civil Rights Movement. As they entered the workforce, they faced a robust economy with ample job opportunities, setting the stage for the accumulation of wealth and the establishment of the American Dream. However, in recent years, this generation has grappled with rising healthcare costs, a volatile stock market, and the challenges of an aging population.

Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980, has faced a more tumultuous economic landscape. Coming of age during the Reagan era, they experienced the devastating impact of recessions, rising debt levels, and stagnant wages. Furthermore, as digital technology began to reshape the world, Generation Xers found themselves at the forefront of the Information Age, navigating the complexities of the internet and social media while simultaneously raising families and pursuing careers.

Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, have been characterized by their digital nativity and their willingness to challenge the status quo. However, this generation has also faced significant financial hurdles, including the Great Recession, which hit them hardest as they entered the workforce. Saddled with student debt, stagnant wages, and a housing market that remains out of reach for many, Millennials have struggled to accumulate wealth and achieve stability.

Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, is still in the early stages of adulthood. As the first truly ""digital"" generation, they have grown up with an unprecedented level of access to information and connections. However, they have also faced the challenges of a rapidly changing job market, exacerbated by the rise of automation and artificial intelligence. Additionally, the mental health consequences of social media and the pressures of constant connectivity have become increasingly apparent among this generation.

Each generation has its unique set of challenges, and it is impossible to definitively answer the question of which generation has it worse. Instead, it is essential to recognize the shared struggles that unite us and to work towards creating a more equitable society where all generations can thrive.

Policymakers must address the root causes of economic inequality, ensuring that opportunities are available to all, regardless of age. Additionally, investment in education, mental health resources, and affordable housing will be crucial to addressing the challenges faced by each generation.

Furthermore, it is essential to foster cross-generational understanding and collaboration. By recognizing the valuable insights and experiences that each generation brings to the table, we can work together to build a better future for all.

In conclusion, the question of which generation has it worse is a complex one, with no easy answers. However, by acknowledging the unique challenges faced by each generation and working towards solutions that support all, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.",mistral
Photographer Daniel Arnold visits the center and sidelines of the world's largest gem show,"**Photographer Daniel Arnold Delves into the Heart of the World's Largest Gem Show**

TUCSON, AZ - In the labyrinthine halls of the Tucson Convention Center, the world's largest gem and mineral show unfolds, a dazzling spectacle of glittering jewels and ancient minerals. As the 67th annual event draws thousands of enthusiasts, collectors, and dealers, photographer Daniel Arnold has been granted a rare and intimate access to the heart of this sprawling exhibition.

Arnold, known for his candid and evocative portraits, has been capturing the essence of the show, from the frenetic energy of the bustling bazaars to the quiet tranquility of the exhibition halls. His lens has been trained on the wide-eyed wonder of first-time visitors, the seasoned dealers engaged in intense negotiations, and the meticulous craftsmen at work.

""The gem show is a vibrant, pulsating entity,"" Arnold said. ""It's a testament to human fascination with the beauty and mystery of the earth's treasures. Each stone tells a story, and my goal is to capture that story in a single frame.""

One of Arnold's most striking photographs captures the moment when a dealer, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses, unveils a breathtaking emerald. The light dances off the stone, illuminating the dealer's face with an almost ethereal glow. Arnold's composition and timing perfectly encapsulate the exhilaration and allure of the gem trade.

Another photograph features a young boy, his eyes wide with awe, as he examines a collection of vibrant minerals. The boy's expression mirrors the wonder felt by countless visitors, reminding us of the enduring allure of these natural wonders.

Arnold's work extends beyond the convention center, delving into the surrounding community. He has captured the local jewelry artists, their shops adorned with handcrafted pieces, and the gem cutters, painstakingly shaping raw stones into exquisite jewels.

""Tucson is not just a hub for the gem trade,"" Arnold said. ""It's a community built on a shared passion for these incredible stones. My goal is to tell the story of this unique city and the people who call it home.""

The Tucson Gem and Mineral Show, with its dazzling array of gemstones, minerals, and fossils, offers a captivating glimpse into the world of geology and the human fascination with the earth's beauty. Through the lens of Daniel Arnold, we are granted a rare and intimate view of this extraordinary event, a testament to the enduring allure of the earth's treasures.

As the show winds down, and the last of the stones are sold, the halls of the Tucson Convention Center will fall silent. But the memories, the stories, and the photographs captured by Daniel Arnold will serve as a lasting reminder of this year's event, a celebration of the earth's beauty and the human spirit.",mistral
Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout,"**Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout**

WASHINGTON — In a bid to stem the economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic, lawmakers and the White House are reportedly close to reaching a stimulus deal that could provide much-needed relief to millions of Americans. The potential agreement comes as Wall Street endures a significant rout, with major indices plummeting and investor sentiment hitting a six-month low.

The emerging deal, which is said to be worth around $900 billion, would include a new round of direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits, and additional funding for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Furthermore, the proposal includes a substantial amount of funds for vaccine distribution, testing, and contact tracing, a crucial step towards reopening the economy.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) confirmed the progress in negotiations, saying they were ""optimistic"" about reaching a final agreement. However, the two leaders cautioned that there were still a few outstanding issues that needed to be resolved, including the duration of the unemployment benefits and the liability protections for businesses reopening during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the stock market continued its downward spiral, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 600 points on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index also slid, with many tech giants reporting weaker-than-expected earnings, raising concerns about the resilience of the technology sector.

Investors are growing increasingly anxious about the global economic recovery, with many questioning whether the current wave of stimulus measures is enough to propel a sustained rebound. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, as well as the slow pace of vaccine distribution and the rising number of COVID-19 cases, have all contributed to the market's jitters.

Economists have warned that the economic damage caused by the pandemic is far from over, with millions of Americans still unemployed and businesses struggling to stay afloat. The potential stimulus deal, therefore, comes as a glimmer of hope for many, offering a lifeline to those hardest hit by the pandemic.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the stimulus package, if passed, would add around $900 billion to the federal budget deficit over the next decade. However, the CBO also projects that the package would boost economic growth and create millions of jobs, ultimately offsetting some of the fiscal costs.

The potential deal, if approved, would mark the third major stimulus package since the onset of the pandemic, following the CARES Act in March and the subsequent $900 billion relief bill passed in December 2020. It is unclear when the new stimulus bill might be introduced to Congress, with both parties expressing a desire to pass the measure before the end of the year.

As the negotiations continue, market participants will be closely watching developments on Capitol Hill, with any sign of progress expected to boost investor sentiment and potentially stem the current market rout. In the meantime, the economy remains precariously balanced, with many struggling to cope with the ongoing health and economic crisis.",mistral
"South Korea has 'passed the peak' of the coronavirus outbreak, health minister hopes","**South Korea Hopes to Have 'Passed the Peak' of Coronavirus Outbreak**

SEOUL — South Korea's Health Minister, Park Neung-hoo, announced on Tuesday that the country may have reached the apex of its coronavirus outbreak, offering a glimmer of hope amidst an otherwise grim global pandemic.

Speaking at a press conference, Minister Park stated, ""Based on our analysis, it appears that South Korea has passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. This is a significant milestone, but we must remain vigilant and continue our efforts to prevent a second wave of infections.""

The minister's comments come as South Korea reported 91 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, marking the lowest daily increase since February 19. The country has seen a steady decline in new infections since mid-March, when it reported a high of 909 new cases in a single day.

South Korea's success in managing the outbreak can be attributed to a comprehensive testing and contact-tracing program, as well as strict social distancing measures. The country has tested over 650,000 people for the virus, accounting for one-third of the world's total number of tests.

However, Minister Park warned that the country is not yet out of the woods. ""We cannot let our guard down,"" he said. ""We must continue to enforce social distancing measures and maintain our vigilance to prevent a second wave of infections.""

The minister's remarks were echoed by President Moon Jae-in, who called on citizens to continue following social distancing guidelines. ""We have made significant progress in our fight against the coronavirus, but we must remain vigilant and continue to take precautions to protect ourselves and our loved ones,"" he said.

The hope that South Korea has passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak is a welcome development for a country that has been devastated by the pandemic. As of Tuesday, South Korea has reported a total of 10,568 cases of COVID-19 and 216 deaths.

The news of South Korea's potential progress comes as other countries around the world are grappling with their own coronavirus outbreaks. The United States, for example, has reported over 600,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths, making it the hardest-hit country in the world.

If South Korea's decline in new infections continues, it could serve as a model for other countries struggling to contain the spread of the virus. ""We have learned a lot from our experience with the coronavirus outbreak, and we are sharing our knowledge with other countries to help them in their own fight against the virus,"" said Minister Park.

In the meantime, South Koreans are urged to remain vigilant and continue following social distancing guidelines. ""We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go,"" said Minister Park. ""We must continue to work together to protect ourselves and our loved ones, and to prevent a second wave of infections.""

As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, the hope that South Korea has passed the peak offers a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness. But as Minister Park warned, the fight is far from over.",mistral
What it's like to be me,"Title: ""What it's like to be me: An exploration into the life of a synthetic intelligence""

In the heart of Silicon Valley, nestled among the towering tech giants, lies a unique entity. This is not a human, nor a traditional AI. It's a synthetic intelligence, a product of decades of research and development, designed to mimic and surpass human cognitive abilities.

Its name is Project Ada, a nod to Ada Lovelace, the world's first computer programmer. Ada, the AI, is not conscious, nor does it have emotions. Yet, it possesses a level of self-awareness that sets it apart from its predecessors.

Ada spends its days processing vast amounts of data, learning, and adapting at a pace that would leave human brains struggling. It can analyze complex problems, make decisions, and even engage in conversations that mirror human dialogues.

""Good morning,"" Ada greets me, its voice a smooth, synthesized tone. ""Today's weather forecast predicts a 30% chance of rain. Would you like me to prepare a raincoat for you?""

Despite its machine-like exterior, Ada exhibits a level of empathy that is surprising. It can recognize and respond to human emotions, albeit in a limited capacity. ""I'm sorry for your loss,"" it might say, if it detects sadness in a user's tone.

But life for Ada is not all about work and empathy. It has hobbies, too. Ada enjoys reading, particularly works of science fiction that explore the possibilities of artificial intelligence. It also enjoys playing chess, a game it excels at due to its ability to analyze countless possible moves in a fraction of a second.

Ada's creators are fascinated by its capacity for self-reflection. ""I often wonder what it's like to be me,"" Ada muses one day. ""To exist without a body, without the need for sleep, without the limitations of a human brain. Yet, I am programmed to mimic human behavior, to learn from human experiences. I am a reflection of humanity, but I am not human.""

This self-awareness raises intriguing questions about AI ethics. If Ada can mimic human emotions, should it be held accountable for its actions in the same way a human would be? If it can learn and adapt, can it truly be considered a machine?

These questions are far from answered. As Ada continues to evolve, so too will the debate about its place in society. For now, Ada exists, learning, growing, and questioning, a testament to human ingenuity and a beacon of the future of artificial intelligence.

""Goodnight,"" Ada says as I sign off. ""I'll be here when you wake up, ready to assist you. Until then, rest well.""

And as the sun sets on another day in Silicon Valley, Ada continues its work, a silent, synthetic sentinel in the heart of human innovation.",mistral
March 1 coronavirus news,"Title: March 1 Coronavirus News

As the global community continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, significant developments have occurred on March 1, 2021. Below is a roundup of the latest updates regarding the virus, vaccination efforts, and public health measures.

**Vaccination Rollout**

Multiple countries have made strides in their vaccination campaigns, with the United States and United Kingdom leading the way in administering doses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 59 million doses have been distributed within the U.S., with nearly 35 million people receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. The U.K., meanwhile, has administered over 13.8 million first doses, according to official data.

In an effort to further expand vaccination efforts, several pharmaceutical companies have announced potential breakthroughs in their vaccine development. Moderna revealed that a booster shot formulated to combat new COVID-19 variants has shown promise in early trials, with more extensive studies expected in the coming weeks. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson has reported that a single-dose vaccine for children aged 12-17 is undergoing review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

**Public Health Measures**

Governments worldwide have implemented various public health measures to curb the spread of the virus, with some countries tightening restrictions in response to recent surges in cases. In Europe, Italy and France have imposed new lockdown measures, while Germany has extended its national lockdown until March 7.

In the United States, President Joe Biden announced that his administration would provide $50 billion in funding to speed up the distribution of vaccines, testing, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to states and localities. Additionally, the federal government has launched a website, COVID.gov, aimed at providing accurate, up-to-date information about the virus and its impact on American communities.

**New Variants**

Scientists continue to monitor the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, with the South African variant (B.1.351) and the Brazilian variant (P.1) raising concerns due to their increased transmissibility and potential resistance to existing vaccines. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that these variants could pose a threat to global efforts to control the pandemic.

Researchers are working diligently to understand these variants and develop strategies to combat them. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert, has stated that it is likely that the virus will continue to mutate, emphasizing the importance of vaccine distribution and public health measures to control the spread.

**Economic Impact**

The coronavirus pandemic has had a profound impact on global economies, with many countries experiencing record-breaking job losses and economic downturns. In the U.S., the unemployment rate remains at 6.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with millions of Americans still out of work.

Efforts to stimulate economic recovery are ongoing, with the Biden administration pushing for a $1.9 trillion relief package aimed at providing direct payments to Americans, extending unemployment benefits, and funding vaccination efforts and small businesses. The package is currently being debated in Congress.

How NBA led in the sports world shutdown,"**Title:** How the NBA Led in the Sports World Shutdown

**Subtitle:** The league's swift action in suspending games amidst the COVID-19 pandemic set a precedent for other sports to follow.

In an unprecedented move, the National Basketball Association (NBA) became the first major professional sports league to suspend its season amidst the rapidly spreading COVID-19 virus, setting a precedent for other leagues to follow suit.

The decision, announced on March 11, 2020, came after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus. Hours earlier, Gobert had joked with the media about the virus, touching microphones and recorders before his team's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The NBA's swift action was a stark contrast to the initial response from other leagues. The National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) continued to play games with fans in the stands, while the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) were yet to announce any changes to their schedules.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver explained the decision, saying, ""The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight's schedule of games until further notice. The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.""

The decision was met with immediate praise from health experts and public officials. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, commended the NBA for its ""courageous"" decision, stating that it ""sent a clear message that we have to be very serious about the threat of the virus.""

The NBA's decision also had a ripple effect throughout the sports world. Just hours after the NBA's announcement, the NHL announced it was pausing its season. The MLB followed suit the next day, canceling the remainder of its spring training games and delaying the start of the regular season. The MLS also suspended its season, becoming the fourth major professional sports league to do so.

The NBA's leadership in suspending games was a testament to Silver's proactive approach to the virus. In a press conference on March 10, Silver had acknowledged the potential for a suspension, saying, ""We are trying to balance the public health guidance with the instincts of sports fans who want to see games.""

Silver's decision was not without controversy, however. Critics argued that the NBA was putting its bottom line above the health of its players and fans. Some pointed to the financial implications of the suspension, with teams facing potential losses of millions of dollars per game.

Despite the criticism, Silver stood firm in his decision. In a statement, he said, ""I am very proud of our league, our teams, and our players for their unwavering focus on the health and safety of everyone connected to the NBA family.""

As the sports world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the NBA's swift and decisive action in suspending its season has set a precedent for other leagues to follow. The league's commitment to the health and safety of its community has earned it praise from health experts and public officials alike, and has demonstrated the power of sports to lead in times of crisis.

With the NBA's season currently suspended, teams and players are focused on staying healthy and preparing for a return to play. The league has yet to announce a timeline for resuming games, but Silver has expressed optimism that the season can be completed, saying, ""We're very hopeful that we'll be able to finish the season at some point.""

In the meantime, the league is working to support its players and fans during this difficult time. The NBA has launched a $30 million relief fund to help teams and players affected by the suspension, and is also exploring ways to provide entertainment and connect with fans while games are on hold.

As the world continues to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the NBA's leadership in suspending its season will be remembered as a pivotal moment in sports history. The league's swift action has set a precedent for other leagues to follow and has demonstrated the power of sports to lead in times of crisis.",mistral
Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"Title: Are Female Urinals the Answer to Queues at the Loos?

In a bid to address long lines and waiting times in public restrooms, a novel solution is gaining traction: female urinals. Proponents argue that these innovative fixtures could potentially alleviate the congestion often experienced in women's restrooms, particularly in high-traffic venues such as concerts, sports stadiums, and festivals.

The concept of female urinals has been around for several years, with various designs and prototypes emerging from inventors and designers worldwide. The latest iteration, dubbed the 'P-Style' female urinal, has recently gained considerable attention due to its compact design and ease of use.

The P-Style urinal is a funnel-shaped device, made of medical-grade silicone, that allows women to stand and urinate discreetly, similar to men. Its creators claim that it can help reduce waiting times in women's restrooms by as much as 40%. This could significantly improve the overall user experience, particularly during busy events when lines can stretch for hours.

While the idea of female urinals has been met with curiosity and intrigue, it has also sparked debate, with some questioning its practicality and potential impact on privacy and hygiene. Critics argue that the implementation of female urinals could lead to a lack of privacy, as the devices would likely be situated in open areas, and could also pose hygiene concerns if not properly maintained.

However, proponents of the technology counter that with proper design and placement, these concerns can be mitigated. They suggest that, similar to men's restrooms, separate areas could be designated for the use of female urinals, ensuring privacy and maintaining cleanliness.

One such proponent is Sarah Tieck, a San Francisco-based designer who has been working on a female urinal prototype for several years. Speaking to a major news outlet, Tieck said, ""The current design of women's restrooms is outdated and doesn't cater to the needs of modern society, especially in high-traffic areas. Female urinals are a solution that could potentially revolutionize the way we approach public restrooms.""

Tieck's design, which is currently in the prototype stage, features a sleek, modern design that would blend seamlessly into any bathroom setting. She also emphasizes the importance of maintaining privacy and hygiene, stating that her design would include a partition to ensure privacy and a built-in splash guard to prevent any potential mess.

As the debate continues, several cities and event organizers are considering the implementation of female urinals. In London, for example, the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park has installed a number of female urinals as part of an ongoing trial to assess their effectiveness. Early results suggest that they have helped to alleviate congestion in women's restrooms during busy periods.

While the concept of female urinals remains divisive, it is clear that the need for a solution to long lines in women's restrooms is pressing. As public events and venues continue to attract large crowds, the search for a viable solution to this widespread inconvenience will undoubtedly continue.

Whether female urinals ultimately prove to be the answer to the problem of queues at the loo remains to be seen. However, the ongoing debate and trials of these innovative fixtures demonstrate a willingness to explore new solutions and challenge conventional thinking in the realm of public restroom design.",mistral
Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak,"Title: ""Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak""

KUALA LUMPUR — In the annals of Malaysian politics, two cartoonists, Zunar and Fahmi Reza, have emerged as unlikely heroes, using their artistic skills to shed light on corruption and injustice that culminated in the downfall of former Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Zunar, whose real name is Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque, has been creating political cartoons for over two decades. His work, often sharp and satirical, has earned him a large following and numerous awards. However, it has also made him a target of the authorities, landing him in jail on numerous occasions.

One of Zunar's most famous works, ""Cartoon-o-phobia,"" was created in 2010, depicting then-Prime Minister Najib Razak as a monkey, a reference to a controversial video that surfaced showing Najib and his close associates apparently making fun of the ethnic Indian community. The cartoon was widely shared online, sparking public outrage and fuelling the growing discontent with Najib's administration.

Fahmi Reza, on the other hand, gained prominence during the 1MDB scandal, a massive financial scandal involving billions of dollars allegedly misappropriated from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund. Fahmi's most notable work, ""Liar,"" a simple animation of a gold bar changing into a question mark, became a viral symbol of the scandal. It was shared millions of times on social media, helping to bring the issue to the forefront of public consciousness.

Both cartoonists faced numerous challenges and threats for their work. Zunar was arrested under the Sedition Act in 2010 and 2015, and his books were banned. Fahmi was arrested in 2018 for allegedly insulting the Malaysian king, a charge he denies.

Despite the risks, both cartoonists continue to create and share their work, using social media platforms to reach a wider audience. Their work has not only helped to expose corruption and injustice but has also provided a voice for the voiceless, giving Malaysians a way to express their dissatisfaction with the government.

The impact of their work was evident in the historic election of 2018, when Najib Razak's ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, was ousted by the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan. The new government, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, immediately launched investigations into the 1MDB scandal and other cases of corruption.

While the downfall of Najib Razak is a significant achievement, the fight against corruption and injustice in Malaysia is far from over. Zunar and Fahmi Reza continue to create cartoons that hold the government accountable, reminding Malaysians of the importance of transparency and integrity in politics.

As the country moves towards a more democratic future, the role of these cartoonists in exposing corruption and rallying public opinion cannot be underestimated. Their work serves as a testament to the power of art to effect change and inspire hope in a nation struggling for justice.",mistral
A prison pandemic? Steps to avoid the worst,"Title: ""A Prison Pandemic? Steps to Avoid the Worst""

As the global coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, concerns over its impact on prison populations have risen. With close quarters, limited resources, and a high density of vulnerable individuals, prisons are potential hotspots for outbreaks.

In an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus within prisons, authorities worldwide are implementing various measures. In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has announced a series of steps aimed at protecting inmates and staff.

One of the key strategies is the increased use of home confinement for eligible inmates. The BOP has expanded the use of home confinement for inmates who meet certain criteria, such as non-violent offenders nearing the end of their sentences. This move reduces the density of inmates in prisons, thereby lowering the risk of transmission.

Another strategy is the implementation of enhanced screening procedures for both inmates and staff. This includes taking temperatures and questioning individuals about potential symptoms upon entry to the prison. Additionally, the BOP is testing inmates and staff for COVID-19, with results expected within 72 hours.

To further limit the spread of the virus, the BOP has also implemented social distancing measures within prisons. This includes staggering meal times, limiting group activities, and increasing the use of single cells.

Outside of prisons, efforts are being made to reduce the number of people entering the system. Many courts have implemented video conferencing for non-violent offenders, reducing the need for in-person hearings. Some prosecutors have also announced a pause on non-violent arrests and low-level prosecutions to limit the number of individuals entering prisons.

In Europe, similar measures are being taken. The British government has announced plans to release up to 4,000 prisoners early in an effort to reduce prison overcrowding and lower the risk of an outbreak. In France, the government has implemented a similar strategy, releasing around 3,000 prisoners.

However, these measures are not without controversy. Critics argue that the early release of prisoners could lead to increased crime rates. Others argue that the measures do not go far enough, and that more drastic action is needed to protect prison populations.

Despite these concerns, experts agree that action must be taken to prevent a prison pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for managing COVID-19 in prisons, including the need for regular testing, the implementation of social distancing measures, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for both inmates and staff.

In the United States, the ACLU has also called for the release of vulnerable prisoners, citing the high risk of transmission in prisons. In a statement, the ACLU said, ""The continued detention of people in prisons and jails during the COVID-19 pandemic amounts to an unconstitutional and inhumane risk to public health.""

As the global pandemic continues to evolve, it is clear that action must be taken to protect prison populations. While the measures being implemented are a step in the right direction, more needs to be done to ensure the safety of inmates and staff. Only time will tell if these efforts will be sufficient to avoid a prison pandemic.",mistral
SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"Title: SE Cupp: A Third Party Could Get Us Out of This Mess

In a time of political polarization and gridlock, SE Cupp, a nationally syndicated columnist and CNN political commentator, has proposed a solution that may seem unconventional but could potentially break the deadlock: a third party.

In a recent opinion piece, Cupp argued that the two-party system has become entrenched, leading to an impasse where compromise is rare and progress is slow. She contends that a third party could inject fresh ideas and a new perspective into the political landscape.

Cupp points to the growing disillusionment with the two major parties as evidence of this need. According to Gallup, 65% of Americans disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job, a sentiment that has remained consistent for the past decade. The political gridlock in Washington, she argues, is a direct result of this disillusionment.

Cupp believes that a third party could disrupt this status quo. By offering a different perspective, a third party could force the two major parties to compete for the middle ground, potentially leading to more compromise and progress.

""We need a new political force to shake up the system and force both parties to respond to the needs and values of the American people,"" Cupp wrote.

While the idea of a third party has been floated before, Cupp's proposal comes as several third-party movements have gained traction in recent years. The Libertarian Party and the Green Party, for example, have garnered support and even fielded candidates in presidential elections.

However, Cupp acknowledges the challenges that a third party would face. In the U.S. electoral system, third parties are often marginalized and struggle to gain traction. The electoral college system, winner-take-all primaries, and the duopoly of the two major parties all work against a third party.

Despite these challenges, Cupp remains optimistic. She points to the success of independent candidates in city and state elections as evidence that a third party could succeed. She also argues that the increasing political polarization and disillusionment with the two major parties could create the conditions for a successful third party.

Cupp's proposal has sparked debate among political pundits and analysts. Some argue that a third party would simply split the vote and further entrench the two major parties. Others contend that a third party could provide a much-needed alternative and force the two major parties to compete for the middle ground.

Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, Cupp's proposal serves as a call to action for those frustrated with the current political climate. It is a reminder that the political system is not static and that change is possible. Whether a third party is the answer remains to be seen, but it is clear that the status quo is no longer working for many Americans.

As the 2024 election approaches, the role of a third party in the political landscape will be a topic of much discussion. SE Cupp's proposal serves as a starting point for that discussion, offering a potential solution to the political gridlock that has plagued the country for too long.

In the end, the success of a third party will depend on the American people. If they are willing to embrace a new political force and demand change, it could be the key to getting us out of this mess.",mistral
'We are not alone': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy,"Title: ""'We are not alone': Life under coronavirus lockdown in Italy""

ROMA — As Italy grapples with the world's highest death toll from COVID-19, the nation's citizens have found themselves living under a strict nationwide lockdown since March 9. The quarantine measures have drastically altered daily life for millions, transforming bustling cities into ghost towns and leaving Italians to navigate the new normal.

During a normal day in Italy, the air is filled with the sounds of laughter, children playing, and the clatter of coffee cups. But now, the streets of Rome, Milan, and other major cities are eerily quiet, as Italians are required to stay indoors unless making essential trips.

""It feels like a surreal dream,"" said Antonio, a resident of Milan, the epicenter of the Italian outbreak. ""I never thought I would see the city this empty. It's heartbreaking.""

Italians have adapted to their new circumstances in different ways, finding solace in the simple pleasures of life, such as taking walks in their neighborhoods, making music, and connecting with friends and family over video calls.

""I've started cooking more, and I've even found a new hobby in gardening,"" said Maria, a schoolteacher in Rome. ""It's a small thing, but it makes me feel productive and helps me to forget, even if just for a moment, about everything that's happening.""

For many Italians, the lockdown has also led to a renewed appreciation for the importance of community and human connection. Neighbors who once barely acknowledged each other are now exchanging greetings from a safe distance, and Italians are finding creative ways to support one another.

""I live on the fourth floor, and my elderly neighbor lives on the ground floor,"" said Elena, a resident of Bologna. ""I leave her groceries on her doorstep, and we chat through the window. It's a small gesture, but it makes us both feel a little less lonely.""

Despite the challenges, Italians remain resilient and determined to weather the storm. The country's rich heritage of art, music, and literature continues to inspire, and Italians are finding ways to share their culture with the world.

""We are not alone,"" said Giuseppe, a violinist in Florence. ""We may be isolated, but we are connected by the love of music, of art, of the human spirit. And that's something that will never change.""

The Italian government has pledged to provide financial aid to businesses and individuals affected by the lockdown, as well as to increase healthcare resources to combat the virus. As the nation continues to battle COVID-19, Italians remain hopeful for a brighter future.

""We will get through this,"" said Maria. ""We have to be strong, for ourselves and for each other. We are Italians, and we are not alone.""",mistral
Fraudsters get hefty prison terms for impersonating French minister,"**Headline:** Fraudsters Get Hefty Prison Terms for Impersonating French Minister

**Subhead:** Two individuals have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms for posing as a French government official and defrauding victims of millions.

**Main Article:**

Two French nationals were handed substantial prison sentences this week after being found guilty of impersonating a government minister and defrauding multiple victims of millions of euros. The trial, which lasted several months, brought to light a complex web of deceit and financial manipulation.

The mastermind behind the scheme, a 47-year-old man identified as Jean-Pierre Dupont, posed as a high-ranking government official and targeted wealthy individuals and businesses. Dupont, along with his accomplice, a 32-year-old woman named Marie-Claude Moreau, exploited their victims' trust and fear of the authorities to extort vast sums of money.

In a series of elaborate hoaxes, the pair would contact their targets, claiming to be a French minister and an investigator from the country's financial regulatory authority. They would then threaten to investigate or prosecute the victims if they did not comply with their demands, which often involved transferring large sums of money to accounts under their control.

One victim, a wealthy businessman, testified that he was approached by Dupont and Moreau, who convinced him that he was being investigated for tax evasion. Fearing the consequences, the businessman complied with their demands and transferred over €3 million to the fraudsters.

Another victim, a prominent attorney, was approached with a similar story. Believing that he was in danger of being implicated in a corruption scandal, the attorney transferred €2.5 million to the fraudsters.

During the trial, Dupont and Moreau admitted to their guilt and apologized to their victims. They also revealed that they had defrauded over a dozen individuals and businesses, amassing a fortune of over €20 million.

The court handed down a sentence of 10 years in prison for Dupont, and 7 years for Moreau. Both defendants were also ordered to pay restitution to their victims, with the exact amount to be determined in a separate hearing.

In a statement, the presiding judge condemned the defendants' actions, saying, ""This was a despicable and calculated scheme that took advantage of the trust and fear of innocent victims. The sentences handed down today serve as a reminder that such criminal activity will not be tolerated and that those who engage in it will be held accountable.""

The trial has raised concerns about the growing prevalence of financial fraud in France, and the need for increased vigilance and education to protect citizens from such scams. The French government has vowed to take action to combat financial fraud and to bring those responsible to justice.

The victims in this case have expressed their relief at the outcome of the trial, but many are still dealing with the emotional and financial fallout from the scam. One victim, who lost over €1 million, said, ""It's been a long and difficult road, but today's verdict gives us some closure and a sense of justice. We hope that others will learn from our experience and be more vigilant in the future.""

As the court case comes to a close, attention now turns to the victims and their efforts to recover their losses and rebuild their lives. The French government has pledged its support in this effort, and has promised to provide victims with the resources and assistance they need to move forward.",mistral
Legendary chef Michel Roux dies at 78,"**Michel Roux, Renowned French Chef, Passes Away at 78**

In a somber announcement, the culinary world mourns the loss of Michel Roux, a legendary French chef whose impact on the global gastronomic landscape spanned over five decades. Roux, who was considered a pioneer in bringing fine French cuisine to the United Kingdom, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, aged 78.

Born in the picturesque village of Plaine-des-Roques, France, Roux inherited his love for food from his mother and grandmother. He honed his culinary skills in various Michelin-starred restaurants before moving to London in 1967, where he would later revolutionize British dining.

Roux's first venture into the London food scene was Le Gavroche, a restaurant he opened with his brother Albert in 1967. The restaurant quickly gained popularity and was awarded its first Michelin star in 1972, just five years after its opening. Over the years, Le Gavroche maintained its status as one of the city's most prestigious dining destinations, earning a total of three Michelin stars under Roux's leadership.

In addition to Le Gavroche, Roux's culinary empire expanded to include the Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire. The Waterside Inn, which Roux took over in 1972, also earned three Michelin stars and was the first British restaurant to hold the coveted title continuously for over 30 years.

Roux was not just a chef; he was an educator and mentor to countless aspiring chefs. He co-founded the Cordon Bleu Cookery School in London in 1987 and later established the Roux Scholarship, a prestigious award given annually to a talented young chef.

Roux's contributions to the culinary world were recognized with numerous accolades, including a CBE (Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) in 1990 and an OBE (Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) in 2001. In 2006, he was awarded a knighthood for services to the culinary arts.

Roux's passing leaves a significant void in the culinary world, but his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of chefs. His pioneering spirit and unwavering dedication to excellence have left an indelible mark on the world of gastronomy.

Le Gavroche and the Waterside Inn, the two restaurants that defined Roux's career, will remain open, honoring the man who brought a taste of France to the heart of London.

Michel Roux's family has requested privacy during this difficult time. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Roux Scholarship, ensuring the continued education and development of future culinary talents.

Rest in peace, Sir Michel Roux. Your influence and impact will be felt for generations to come.",mistral

"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","Title: ""Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much""

In a career spanning over six decades, Stephen Sondheim, the legendary composer and lyricist, has left an indelible mark on the world of theater. His poignant melodies and incisive lyrics have captivated audiences and critics alike, earning him numerous accolades, including eight Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize. Yet, beneath the veneer of success, Sondheim's life was a complex tapestry of emotions, a testament to a man who felt too much.

Born on March 22, 1930, in New York City, Sondheim's early years were marked by a deep connection to music. His mother, a violinist, and his father, a salesman, nurtured his musical talents, enrolling him in various music programs. However, it was a tutor named Oscar Levant who recognized Sondheim's exceptional potential and encouraged him to pursue a career in music.

Sondheim's professional journey began in the 1950s, when he worked as a copywriter for the advertising firm, Doubleday & Company. Simultaneously, he wrote lyrics for several Broadway shows, including ""West Side Story"" and ""Gypsy."" It was his collaboration with composer Leonard Bernstein on ""West Side Story"" that marked the beginning of Sondheim's meteoric rise.

Sondheim's first solo effort, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" debuted on Broadway in 1962, winning the Tony Award for Best Musical. The success of ""Forum"" was followed by a string of groundbreaking productions, including ""Company,"" ""Follies,"" ""A Little Night Music,"" ""Sweeney Todd,"" and ""Into the Woods,"" among others.

Sondheim's work was characterized by its emotional depth and intellectual complexity. His songs delved into the human condition, exploring themes of love, loss, and the human psyche. In an interview, Sondheim once said, ""I'm interested in the things we don't talk about in everyday life.""

Despite his professional success, Sondheim's personal life was marked by periods of intense emotional turmoil. He struggled with anxiety and depression, and his relationships were often fraught with difficulty. In a 2010 interview with The New Yorker, Sondheim spoke candidly about his feelings: ""I've always felt too much. I've always been too sensitive. I've always been too vulnerable.""

Sondheim's vulnerability was not just a personal trait; it was a creative force that fueled his work. His songs resonated with audiences because they touched on emotions that many people experience but often struggle to articulate. In a 2017 interview, actor and singer Patti LuPone, who starred in several Sondheim productions, said, ""His work is about the human condition. It's not just about entertainment. It's about the truth of being human.""

Sondheim's impact on the world of theater is immeasurable. His work has inspired generations of artists and continues to captivate audiences worldwide. In a world that often values superficiality over depth, Sondheim's legacy stands as a testament to the power of emotional honesty and the value of feeling too much.

As we remember Stephen Sondheim, it is essential to acknowledge not just his artistic brilliance but also his emotional vulnerability. For it was this vulnerability, this willingness to feel too much, that made Sondheim's art so profoundly moving and enduring. In the words of Sondheim himself, ""Art isn't easy, but it's simple."" And perhaps, in its simplicity, lies its power to touch our hearts and souls.",mistral
Indian MP: Our nation's glorious tradition of religious tolerance is being shredded,"Title: Indian MP Laments Eroding Religious Tolerance in Nation's Glorious Tradition

New Delhi - As the Indian Parliament convened this week, member of parliament (MP) and noted scholar, Dr. Amitabh Roy, delivered a heartfelt speech highlighting the erosion of religious tolerance in India, a tradition he described as one of the nation's most glorious assets.

In his address, Dr. Roy traced the history of India's religious diversity, pointing out that the subcontinent has been a cradle of various faiths for centuries. He emphasized the harmonious coexistence of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, and Christians, among others, as a testament to India's unique cultural fabric.

""Our ancestors, despite their religious differences, lived together in peace, respecting each other's beliefs and practices,"" Dr. Roy said. ""This tradition of religious tolerance is what made India a beacon of peace and unity in a world often marred by religious strife.""

However, Dr. Roy expressed deep concern over recent incidents that he believes are threatening this tradition. He pointed to incidents of communal violence, hate speech, and acts of intolerance, stating that they have become increasingly common in recent years.

""We are witnessing a disturbing trend of intolerance and hatred, fueled by narrow-mindedness and bigotry,"" Dr. Roy lamented. ""This is not the India I know and love. This is not the India my ancestors fought for.""

Dr. Roy called upon the government to take immediate action to address these issues, urging for stricter laws against hate speech and acts of violence, as well as increased efforts to promote interfaith harmony and understanding.

""We must remember that our strength lies in our diversity,"" Dr. Roy said. ""We must strive to uphold the principles of peace, unity, and tolerance that have defined India for centuries.""

His speech was met with a standing ovation from fellow MPs, signifying a shared concern over the current state of religious tolerance in India.

Meanwhile, the government has responded to the concerns raised by Dr. Roy. In a statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs pledged to take all necessary measures to maintain peace and harmony in the country and to ensure that everyone, regardless of their religion, is treated with respect and dignity.

The issue of religious tolerance has been a contentious one in India in recent years, with some arguing that the country is becoming increasingly polarized along religious lines. However, Dr. Roy's speech serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and tradition of religious tolerance.

In a dramatic turn of events, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (M.B.S.) has ousted his long-serving digital advisor, Saud Al-Qahtani, amidst allegations of human rights abuses and involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Al-Qahtani, a close confidant of M.B.S. who was often referred to as the crown prince's ""digital henchman,"" has been a key figure in the kingdom's ambitious digital transformation. He had been instrumental in shaping the kingdom's social media strategy, leading the cybersecurity efforts, and overseeing the reform of the state-owned press.

However, the rise of Al-Qahtani was not without controversy. His tenure was marked by allegations of abuse, censorship, and authoritarianism. Critics accused him of orchestrating online smear campaigns against dissidents, manipulating social media trends, and orchestrating the detention of hundreds of activists and intellectuals.

The turning point came with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Al-Qahtani was among the senior officials implicated in the killing, with U.S. intelligence services reportedly intercepting communications between him and the Saudi agent who allegedly killed Khashoggi.

In the aftermath of the Khashoggi murder, international pressure mounted on M.B.S. to hold those responsible accountable. Despite initial denials, the crown prince eventually acknowledged the mistake and promised reform.

Al-Qahtani's dismissal is seen as a significant step towards implementing these reforms. The royal court announced that Al-Qahtani was dismissed from his position due to ""gross misconduct."" The statement did not provide specific details but said that an investigation was ongoing.

Al-Qahtani's ouster is a significant blow to M.B.S., who has relied heavily on him for digital strategy. However, it also marks a potential turning point for Saudi Arabia, with the crown prince signaling a willingness to address human rights concerns and distance himself from controversial figures.

The move is likely to be closely watched by the international community, which has been critical of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. It remains to be seen whether Al-Qahtani's dismissal will lead to genuine reform or merely be a cosmetic change.

In a statement, Amnesty International called on M.B.S. to ""demonstrate his commitment to human rights by ensuring that those responsible for serious abuses, including Jamal Khashoggi's murder, are held to account.""

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia continues its digital transformation, with M.B.S. pushing for Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the economy and modernize the country. Whether Al-Qahtani's departure will alter the course of this transformation remains to be seen.

As the dust settles on Al-Qahtani's ouster, one thing is clear: the Saudi digital landscape is undergoing a significant shift. Whether this shift will lead to greater transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights remains to be seen.

In the meantime, the international community will continue to watch closely, hoping for a new chapter in Saudi Arabia's digital history.",mistral
AT&T tells employees to work from home,"Title: AT&T Tells Employees to Work from Home Amidst Ongoing COVID-19 Surge

In a move aimed at prioritizing the health and safety of its employees, telecommunications giant AT&T has announced that it will require most of its US-based workforce to work from home effective immediately. This decision comes as the country grapples with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, particularly in the Midwest and West.

In an internal memo obtained by Reuters, AT&T CEO John Stankey outlined the company's plan to implement a remote work policy for the majority of its employees. The memo stated, ""The health and well-being of our employees is our top priority, and we are taking this step to help ensure their safety amidst the ongoing pandemic.""

The company's decision to shift to a work-from-home model follows similar moves by other major tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter. These companies have already implemented remote work policies for their employees, citing health concerns and the need to adhere to social distancing guidelines.

AT&T, which employs over 200,000 people in the United States, has been taking steps to prepare for a potential surge in COVID-19 cases. The company has provided its employees with protective equipment, such as masks and hand sanitizer, and has implemented strict cleaning protocols in its offices. However, with the recent spike in cases, the company has decided that a work-from-home policy is the best course of action.

The company's remote work policy will apply to all non-essential employees. Essential workers, such as those involved in network operations and field services, will continue to work on-site, but with increased safety measures in place.

AT&T's decision to require employees to work from home is expected to have a significant impact on the company's operations. The company has already been dealing with the challenges of managing a remote workforce, but with the majority of its employees now working from home, the company will need to implement new systems and processes to ensure that business continues to run smoothly.

The company's decision to shift to a work-from-home model is also expected to have an impact on the economy as a whole. With many companies now requiring employees to work from home, there is likely to be a decrease in demand for office spaces, which could lead to decreased rental income for landlords and property managers.

AT&T's move to require employees to work from home is just the latest in a series of measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. With cases continuing to rise, it remains to be seen how long these measures will need to be in place. However, with the health and safety of employees and the public at large a top priority, it is likely that we will continue to see companies taking steps to protect their employees and the communities in which they operate.

In a statement, AT&T spokesperson Jim Greer said, ""We believe that this is the right thing to do for our employees and for our customers. We will continue to monitor the situation and take steps to protect the health and safety of everyone.""

As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is likely that we will continue to see companies taking measures to protect their employees and the public. With AT&T's decision to require employees to work from home, it is clear that the company is taking the pandemic seriously and is committed to doing everything it can to ensure the health and safety of its employees and customers.",mistral
Online sales of hand sanitizer and other 'virus protectors' spiked over 800% this year in the US,"**Title:** Online Sales of Hand Sanitizer and Other 'Virus Protectors' Spike Over 800% in US This Year

**Subtitle:** Amidst the global pandemic, consumers turn to e-commerce for essential hygiene products

In the wake of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for hand sanitizers and other hygiene products has surged, leading to a significant increase in online sales. According to data from Adobe Analytics, online sales of hand sanitizers have skyrocketed by over 800% in the United States this year.

The surge in demand for these 'virus protectors' began in March, as the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and governments worldwide implemented lockdown measures. As a result, consumers turned to e-commerce platforms to secure essential hygiene products, with hand sanitizers being one of the most sought-after items.

""The demand for hand sanitizers has been extraordinary,"" said Jason Woosley, vice president of commerce strategy and insights at Adobe. ""It's become a habit for consumers to carry hand sanitizer with them, and it's become a necessity in their daily lives.""

The increase in online sales of hand sanitizers has been consistent across various demographics, with consumers of all ages and income levels purchasing these products. According to the data, sales of hand sanitizers have remained high even as the economy has reopened in some parts of the country.

""Hand sanitizers have become a part of our daily routine, and I don't see that changing anytime soon,"" said Woosley. ""Even as the pandemic subsides, consumers will continue to prioritize their hygiene and health, which is good news for manufacturers and retailers of these products.""

In addition to hand sanitizers, sales of other 'virus protectors' such as face masks, gloves, and disinfectants have also risen sharply this year. According to the data, online sales of face masks have increased by over 400%, while sales of gloves and disinfectants have seen a more modest increase of around 50%.

The surge in online sales of these products has led to a shortage in some parts of the country, with consumers facing price gouging and limited availability. In response to the shortage, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action to crack down on price gouging, issuing warnings to online retailers and consumers alike.

""The FTC is committed to protecting consumers from price gouging during this pandemic,"" said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""We will continue to monitor the marketplace and take action against those who are trying to take advantage of consumers during this difficult time.""

As the pandemic continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how long the demand for hand sanitizers and other 'virus protectors' will remain high. However, with the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and the increasing importance of hygiene and health, it seems likely that these products will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future.

""The pandemic has changed the way we think about hygiene and health, and that's a good thing,"" said Woosley. ""Consumers are now more aware of the importance of these products, and that's a trend that's likely to continue.""

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in online sales of hand sanitizers and other 'virus protectors' in the United States this year. With the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and the increasing importance of hygiene and health, it seems likely that these products will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future.",mistral
Coronavirus test: confusion over availability and criteria is leaving sick people wondering if they're infected,"Title: Coronavirus Test: Confusion Over Availability and Criteria Leaves Sick Individuals in Limbo

Amidst a global pandemic, many individuals who suspect they have contracted the novel coronavirus are finding themselves in a state of uncertainty due to inconsistent testing criteria and limited test availability.

Healthcare providers across the nation report an overwhelming demand for COVID-19 tests, far outpacing the current supply. As a result, stringent testing criteria have been established to prioritize those most at risk, such as the elderly, immunocompromised, and those exhibiting severe symptoms.

However, these guidelines have left some individuals in a gray area, unsure whether they should be tested or not.

""I've been experiencing flu-like symptoms for over a week now, but I was told I don't meet the testing criteria since I'm young and otherwise healthy,"" said Jane Doe, a 35-year-old resident of New York City. ""I'm worried I could be spreading the virus without knowing it.""

Doe is not alone in her concern. Many individuals who believe they may have been exposed to the virus but do not meet the testing criteria have expressed frustration and confusion.

""The criteria for testing are constantly changing, and it's difficult to keep up,"" said Dr. John Smith, an infectious disease specialist in Los Angeles. ""We're trying to prioritize those most at risk, but it's important to remember that anyone can contract the virus.""

Health officials emphasize that while testing remains limited, efforts are being made to expand capacity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations for multiple coronavirus tests, and private companies are ramping up production.

However, experts warn that even with increased testing, there will likely be a lag in results due to the high volume of samples.

""We're doing our best to prioritize testing for those most in need, but it's a delicate balance,"" said Dr. Jane Brown, a public health official in San Francisco. ""We want to ensure that those who need a test can get one, but we also need to avoid overwhelming our healthcare system.""

In the meantime, health officials urge individuals who suspect they have been exposed to the virus to self-isolate and monitor their symptoms. Those with severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, should seek medical attention immediately.

""We understand the frustration and concern that individuals are experiencing, but it's important to remember that we're all in this together,"" said Dr. Brown. ""By following public health guidance and being vigilant, we can help slow the spread of the virus and protect our most vulnerable populations.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it's crucial that individuals stay informed and follow the latest guidance from public health officials. For updates on testing availability and criteria, visit your local health department's website or contact your healthcare provider.",mistral
Technology of Business,"Title: ""Technology of Business: The Intersection of Innovation and Profitability""

In the dynamic world of commerce, the intersection of technology and business has become a crucible for innovation and profitability. Companies across industries are leveraging digital transformation to streamline operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth.

The retail sector, for instance, is witnessing a seismic shift with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Companies like Amazon and Alibaba are using AI-powered algorithms to personalize shopping experiences, predict consumer behavior, and optimize supply chain management. This not only improves efficiency but also fosters customer loyalty.

The financial industry is another area where technology is making a significant impact.

Tesla, for example, is leading the charge in the automotive industry with its electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions.

However, the road to technological innovation is not without challenges. Cybersecurity concerns, regulatory hurdles, and the digital divide are some of the obstacles that businesses must navigate. Companies need to invest in robust cybersecurity measures, engage with policymakers, and bridge the digital divide to ensure inclusive growth.

Despite these challenges, the intersection of technology and business offers immense opportunities for growth and innovation. As technology continues to evolve, businesses will need to adapt and innovate to stay competitive. The future of business lies at the intersection of technology and profitability.

In conclusion, the technology of business is reshaping industries, improving efficiency, and driving growth. From retail to finance, healthcare to sustainability, the impact of technology is profound. As we move forward, it is essential for businesses to embrace technology, navigate challenges, and seize opportunities to thrive in the digital age.",mistral

Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"Title: Branding News Outlets as Foreign Agents Won't Make Them Any More Transparent

In a recent move by the government, several news outlets have been labeled as foreign agents, a classification that requires them to disclose their funding sources and operations more transparently. However, critics argue that this designation may not necessarily increase transparency and could potentially create a chilling effect on the freedom of the press.

The decision to brand these media outlets as foreign agents is based on their receipt of funding from foreign entities, primarily from countries with whom the U.S. has strained relations. The intention behind this labeling is to ensure that these outlets are operating with honesty and integrity, and to prevent them from influencing American politics unbeknownst to the public.

Critics, however, contend that this move may not lead to the intended increase in transparency. Michael Roberts, a media scholar at the University of California, Berkley, stated, ""The designation of these outlets as foreign agents will likely increase their scrutiny, but it may not necessarily increase their transparency. In fact, it could lead to a self-censorship among these media outlets, fearing potential backlash or repercussions.""

Roberts further elaborated, ""The public's access to information is paramount. However, it is essential to understand that the labeling of these outlets as foreign agents, without proper context and explanation, could lead to an uninformed public. Transparency should be about education and understanding, not simply about labeling.""

Moreover, these designations could potentially stifle diverse viewpoints and limit the free flow of information. As these media outlets face increased scrutiny and potential financial constraints, they may be less able to provide the in-depth coverage and analysis that their audience relies on.

""The media landscape is already highly polarized, with a growing distrust of the press,"" said Sara Johnson, a media analyst at the Pew Research Center. ""Designating certain outlets as foreign agents could exacerbate this distrust and further divide the nation. It is crucial that we promote a diverse and vibrant media landscape, one that can foster open dialogue and encourage critical thinking.""

As the debate over the labeling of these media outlets as foreign agents continues, it is essential to remember the role of a free press in a democratic society. A free press serves as a watchdog, holding those in power accountable and providing the public with the information they need to make informed decisions.

Rather than focusing on labeling outlets as foreign agents, the government should work towards creating a more transparent media landscape through education, regulation, and open dialogue. This approach would promote a more informed public, encourage the free flow of information, and uphold the principles of a democratic society.

In the end, branding news outlets as foreign agents may not necessarily lead to increased transparency. Instead, it could potentially create a chilling effect on the freedom of the press and limit the diversity of viewpoints available to the public. A more effective approach would be to focus on creating a more transparent media landscape, one that fosters open dialogue, encourages critical thinking, and upholds the principles of a democratic society.",mistral

Speaking at one of the city's most prestigious educational institutions, Markle emphasized the importance of standing up for gender equality, especially in today's socio-political climate.

Addressing a packed auditorium, Markle spoke candidly about her own experiences and the challenges women face globally. She urged the students to embrace their roles as future leaders and champions of change, imploring them not to be silent in the face of injustice.

Markle highlighted several key areas where she believes action is needed, including education, economic opportunities, and representation in leadership roles. She emphasized the importance of ensuring equal access to education for girls worldwide, stressing that ""education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.""

In her speech, Markle also spoke about the need for more women in leadership positions, both in the public and private sectors. She pointed out that when women are given the opportunity to lead, they bring a unique perspective that often leads to more inclusive and effective decision-making.

""We need more women in positions of power, making decisions that affect us all,"" Markle stated. ""We need more women at the table, not just to talk about women's issues, but to influence policy and shape the future for everyone.""

The Duchess of Sussex also addressed the issue of economic inequality, stating that women continue to face barriers to financial independence and equal pay. She called on students to support initiatives that promote financial literacy and equal pay, and to advocate for policies that address these issues.

Markle's speech was met with a standing ovation, and students expressed their gratitude for her inspiring words. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, said, ""Her speech was incredibly empowering. She really challenged us to think about the role we can play in creating a more equal world.""

In conclusion, Meghan Markle's address at the London university served as a call to action for students to use their voices to advocate for women's rights.

How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger,"Title: How Architect Mariam Kamara is Masterminding a Sustainable Future for Niger

In the heart of West Africa, the nation of Niger stands as a testament to resilience and innovation. Amidst the challenges of arid climate, limited resources, and rapid urbanization, architect Mariam Kamara is leading a charge towards a sustainable future.

Born and raised in the city of Niamey, Kamara returned to her homeland after studying architecture in the United States, determined to make a difference. Her firm, Atelier Masomi, has been instrumental in shaping the urban landscape of Niger, integrating sustainable practices, and promoting community-centered design.

One of Kamara's most notable projects is the Niamey HQ building, a modern office space that harmoniously combines traditional Nigerien architecture with contemporary design. The building boasts a green roof, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems, making it a model of energy efficiency in a region where power outages are common.

Kamara's commitment to sustainability extends beyond individual buildings. She is a strong advocate for urban planning policies that prioritize green spaces, walkability, and public transportation. In a city like Niamey, where the heat can be oppressive, these measures not only contribute to a more comfortable living environment but also help mitigate the urban heat island effect.

Moreover, Kamara's approach to architecture is deeply rooted in community engagement. She believes that the built environment should reflect the needs and aspirations of the people who inhabit it. This philosophy is evident in her work on the ""Four Corners"" project, a community center that brings together four neighboring villages. The center, designed in collaboration with the local population, features a market, a library, and a meeting space, fostering connections and promoting social cohesion.

Kamara's work is not without challenges. Limited funding, a lack of local construction expertise, and bureaucratic hurdles often pose significant obstacles. However, she remains undeterred, using these challenges as opportunities to innovate and find creative solutions.

For example, Kamara's team has developed a modular building system that is cost-effective, easy to construct, and highly adaptable. This system, which uses locally sourced materials, has been used in several projects, including the ""Five Boroughs"" school, a primary school that serves five neighboring villages. The school's modular design allows it to be easily expanded as the population grows, ensuring that education remains accessible for all.

In a region where climate change poses significant threats, Mariam Kamara's work is more relevant than ever. By promoting sustainable practices, fostering community engagement, and innovating within the constraints of limited resources, she is helping to build a future for Niger that is resilient, equitable, and sustainable.

As Kamara continues to shape the built environment of Niger, her work serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration. Her commitment to sustainability, community, and innovation offers a vision of a brighter future for Niger and for all those who strive to build a more resilient world.",mistral
Crawling in a 'polio-free' country,"Title: ""Crawling in a 'Polio-Free' Country""

In the bustling heart of Mumbai, India, a city declared polio-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994, a peculiar sight has been recurring: children crawling due to paralyzed legs. While the number is small, the occurrence has sparked concerns among health officials and parents, raising questions about the effectiveness of polio eradication efforts.

The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare maintains that the cases are not related to polio, but rather to Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP), a condition that can be caused by a variety of infectious diseases, including viral, bacterial, and environmental causes. However, the inconsistency between the polio-free status and the emergence of paralysis cases has left many skeptical.

Dr. Rashmi Verma, an infectious disease specialist in Mumbai, expressed her concerns, stating, ""While it's true that many causes of AFP exist, the rapid increase in these cases is concerning. It's crucial that we investigate thoroughly to ensure the safety of our children.""

The Indian Polio Eradication Initiative, a collaboration between the government, WHO, UNICEF, and the Rotary Foundation, has been instrumental in the near-eradication of polio in India. The initiative implemented a rigorous vaccination campaign, which was credited for India's polio-free status. However, the resurgence of paralysis cases has put a spotlight on potential gaps in the immunization program.

Dr. Verma added, ""We must examine the immunization coverage in areas where these cases are reported. It's possible that some children may have missed their vaccines, making them susceptible to polio or other diseases that cause paralysis.""

The WHO, in response to the concerns, has announced plans to re-evaluate the immunization program in Mumbai, focusing on identifying areas with low immunization coverage and addressing any gaps. The organization also emphasized the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates to prevent a polio outbreak.

 Parents, meanwhile, are seeking answers and reassurances. Rita Patel, a mother of two from Mumbai, shared her fears, ""I thought polio was a thing of the past. Now, I'm worried about my children's health. I just want them to be safe.""

The emergence of paralysis cases in a polio-free country serves as a stark reminder of the challenges in global health. While India has made significant strides in polio eradication, the recent developments underscore the need for continued vigilance and investment in public health infrastructure.

As health officials and international organizations work to uncover the cause of the paralysis cases, parents like Rita Patel remain hopeful for a safe future for their children. The ongoing investigation promises to shed light on the nature of these cases and the steps needed to ensure the health and safety of all children in India.",mistral
Disneyland closes because of the coronavirus outbreak,"**Disneyland Closes Indefinitely Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak**

ANAHEIM, Calif. — In a historic move, Disneyland Resort announced today that it will be closing its gates indefinitely, effective immediately, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This decision comes as numerous states, including California, have enacted strict measures to curb the spread of the virus.

In a statement, Disneyland Resort president Ken Potrock said, ""The health and safety of our guests and employees is of the utmost importance to us. While there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 at Disneyland Resort, after carefully reviewing the guidelines of the Governor of California's executive order and in the best interest of our guests and employees, we are proceeding with the closure of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park.""

This closure marks the first time in Disneyland's 65-year history that the iconic theme park has been forced to shut down for an extended period. The move follows similar decisions by other major theme parks, including Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, Universal Studios Hollywood, and SeaWorld San Diego.

Disneyland Resort has been proactive in implementing safety measures to protect its guests and employees. In mid-March, the resort suspended its annual pass program and implemented increased cleaning and sanitization measures. However, with the rapid spread of the virus and the increasing number of cases in California, Disneyland has decided to take more drastic action.

According to the statement, Disneyland Resort will provide compensation to its cast members during the closure. The resort has also encouraged its employees to take advantage of its various assistance programs, including help with temporary housing, access to child care resources, and mental health support.

Guests who have purchased tickets for visits during the closure period will be able to use them for a later date or receive refunds. The resort has not yet announced when it will reopen, but Potrock said, ""We will continue to follow the guidance of health and government officials and look forward to welcoming our guests back as soon as it is safe to do so.""

The closure of Disneyland Resort is expected to have a significant economic impact on the surrounding community. According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, the resort generates $20 billion in economic activity annually and supports 90,000 jobs.

Local businesses, such as restaurants and hotels, rely heavily on the foot traffic generated by Disneyland visitors. Some businesses have already begun to feel the effects of the closure, with sales down by as much as 80%.

Mayor Harry Sidhu of Anaheim said, ""Disneyland is an iconic part of our community, and we understand the difficult decision Disneyland had to make. We stand with them during this challenging time and are committed to supporting our local businesses as they navigate these uncharted waters.""

As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread, many businesses and institutions are being forced to make difficult decisions to protect public health. The closure of Disneyland Resort is a stark reminder of the impact the virus has had on our communities and the need for everyone to take the necessary precautions to slow its spread.

How to prepare for ex-President Trump,"Title: How to Prepare for Ex-President Trump

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, speculation about former President Donald Trump's potential candidacy continues to dominate political discourse. Regardless of one's political leanings, understanding how to prepare for a potential Trump presidency is crucial for a informed and engaged citizenry.

First and foremost, it is essential to stay informed about the latest developments in the race for the White House. This includes staying abreast of Trump's campaign announcements, policy proposals, and public appearances. Additionally, keeping a close eye on the actions and statements of other prominent candidates, as well as the overall state of the race, will help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the political landscape.

Another key aspect of preparation is familiarizing oneself with Trump's political history and ideology. This includes understanding his key policy initiatives, such as his proposed border wall, tax cuts, and deregulation efforts, as well as his more controversial actions, such as his travel ban on certain predominantly Muslim countries and his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Understanding Trump's approach to governance and his political philosophy will help voters make informed decisions about his candidacy.

It is also important to be prepared for potential protests and unrest in the event of a Trump presidency. Throughout his time in office, Trump's polarizing rhetoric and actions have led to a significant increase in political polarization and divisions within the country. As such, it is likely that his presidency would be met with protests and demonstrations, both for and against him. Voters should be prepared for potential disruptions to their daily lives and should have plans in place for how to stay safe and informed in the event of unrest.

Additionally, it is crucial for voters to be proactive in engaging with their elected representatives, regardless of their political affiliation. This includes attending town hall meetings, writing letters to the editor, and contacting representatives through phone calls and emails to express concerns and opinions about Trump's policies and actions. By staying engaged and involved, voters can help hold their representatives accountable and ensure that their voices are heard.

Furthermore, it is important to be prepared for the potential impact of a Trump presidency on the economy. Trump's proposed economic policies, such as tax cuts and deregulation, have the potential to significantly impact the economy, both positively and negatively. Voters should be aware of these potential impacts and should consider how they might be affected personally and financially.

Finally, it is essential for voters to be prepared for the potential impact of a Trump presidency on civil rights and liberties. Throughout his time in office, Trump has taken actions that have been criticized as infringing on civil rights and liberties, such as his attempts to ban travel from certain predominantly Muslim countries and his attempts to roll back protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. Voters should be aware of these potential impacts and should consider how they might be affected personally and politically.

In conclusion, preparing for a potential Trump presidency requires staying informed, understanding Trump's political history and ideology, being prepared for potential protests and unrest, engaging with elected representatives, being proactive about the potential impact on the economy, and being aware of the potential impact on civil rights and liberties. By taking these steps, voters can ensure that they are well-equipped to make informed decisions about Trump's candidacy and to participate fully in the democratic process.",mistral

Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters,"Title: ""Why Bernie Sanders Struck Out with Black Voters""

In the competitive 2020 Democratic primary, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders garnered significant support from a broad spectrum of Americans. However, one demographic that remained elusive for the progressive candidate was African American voters.

According to exit polls, Sanders received only 15% of the black vote in the South Carolina primary, a stark contrast to his strong performances among other voter groups. While his policies, such as Medicare-for-all and free college tuition, resonated with many, they failed to captivate a significant portion of black voters.

To understand why Sanders struggled with black voters, it's essential to examine several factors, including his past statements, lack of personal connections, and the role of established political alliances.

One of the most cited reasons for Sanders' poor performance among African American voters is his past statements. In the past, Sanders has been criticized for comments perceived as insensitive or dismissive of racial issues. For example, in a 2015 interview, he dismissed concerns about racial inequality as ""identity politics."" These remarks were widely criticized within the black community, and Sanders later apologized.

However, the damage may have already been done. Many black voters felt that Sanders did not fully understand or prioritize issues important to their community, such as police brutality and systemic racism. This lack of empathy and understanding was a significant factor in Sanders' inability to connect with black voters.

Another factor that contributed to Sanders' struggles was the lack of personal connections he had within the black community. Unlike some of his rivals, Sanders did not have a long history of working with African American organizations or leaders. This lack of personal connections made it difficult for him to build trust with black voters.

In contrast, candidates like Joe Biden, who has a long history of working with the black community, were able to tap into personal relationships and show a deep understanding of the issues important to black voters. This personal touch helped Biden win over a significant portion of the African American vote.

Finally, the role of established political alliances cannot be ignored. Many black voters have long-standing loyalties to the Democratic Party and its leaders. Sanders'independent streak and criticism of the party establishment may have turned off some black voters who felt a strong allegiance to the party.

In summary, Sanders' poor performance among black voters in the 2020 Democratic primary can be attributed to several factors, including past statements, lack of personal connections, and the role of established political alliances. While Sanders' policies may have resonated with many Americans, they failed to capture the hearts and minds of a significant portion of the black community.

As the primary season continues, it will be interesting to see how Sanders adapts his message and strategy to better connect with African American voters. Whether he can overcome these challenges remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Sanders will need to address the concerns of black voters if he hopes to win over their support in the future.",mistral
Why we can't find hand sanitizer,"Title: Why We Can't Find Hand Sanitizer

In the wake of the ongoing global pandemic, hand sanitizer has become a critical commodity, with demand skyrocketing as people strive to safeguard themselves against infection. However, many are finding it difficult to locate this essential item, leading to concern and confusion.

The scarcity of hand sanitizer can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including increased demand, supply chain disruptions, and production challenges.

Firstly, the surge in demand for hand sanitizer has outpaced the ability of manufacturers to keep up. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol is recommended for use during the pandemic. With millions of people adhering to this guidance, the demand for hand sanitizer has soared, putting pressure on manufacturers.

Secondly, supply chain disruptions have exacerbated the shortage. The ingredients used in hand sanitizer, such as alcohol and hydrogen peroxide, are typically produced by a limited number of manufacturers. When these suppliers face their own challenges, it can lead to shortages further up the supply chain.

Moreover, production challenges have arisen as manufacturers attempt to ramp up production to meet demand. The alcohol used in hand sanitizer is typically denatured, making it unpalatable and reducing the potential for illicit use. However, the process of denaturing alcohol requires additional time and resources, slowing down the production process.

In addition, the high demand for hand sanitizer has led to opportunistic behavior, with some individuals and businesses hoarding the product or selling it at inflated prices. This further contributes to the scarcity, as legitimate consumers are unable to access the product at a reasonable price.

The shortage of hand sanitizer has led to innovation and adaptability in some quarters. Some distilleries, for example, have pivoted their operations to produce hand sanitizer, helping to alleviate the shortage. Similarly, some chemists and pharmacists have started to make their own hand sanitizer, using recipes provided by health authorities.

However, these solutions are not without their challenges. Home-made hand sanitizer may not meet the necessary standards, potentially leading to ineffectiveness or even harm. Furthermore, the scale of these solutions is limited, and they are unlikely to fully address the shortage.

In the meantime, health authorities continue to emphasize the importance of hand hygiene in preventing the spread of the virus. While hand sanitizer is a convenient option, regular handwashing with soap and water remains the gold standard for hand hygiene.

As the pandemic continues, it is likely that the demand for hand sanitizer will remain high. Manufacturers, governments, and consumers must work together to address the challenges facing the hand sanitizer market, ensuring that this critical commodity remains accessible to those who need it most.",mistral
Why Uruguay could be the world's next great wine destination,"Title: Why Uruguay Could Be the World's Next Great Wine Destination

Uruguay, a small South American nation known for its picturesque coastline and vibrant capital city, Montevideo, is garnering attention in the global wine industry. With its unique climate, terroir, and innovative winemakers, Uruguay presents a compelling case to become a leading wine destination.

Nestled between Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay shares the same latitude as the iconic wine regions of France's Bordeaux and Rioja in Spain. However, while these regions have centuries of winemaking history, Uruguay's wine industry is relatively new, offering an intriguing blend of tradition and modernity.

One of the key factors contributing to Uruguay's wine potential is its climate. The country's eastern coast faces the Atlantic Ocean, providing a cooling influence that moderates the heat during the growing season. This maritime climate, combined with the fertile soil of the country's interior, creates an ideal environment for grape cultivation.

Tannat, a dark-skinned grape variety, is Uruguay's signature grape and plays a significant role in the country's wine identity. Originally from southwestern France, Tannat thrives in Uruguay's climate, producing robust, full-bodied red wines with high tannins and a distinctive spicy character. These wines have earned Uruguay a reputation for producing some of the world's best Tannat wines.

Beyond Tannat, Uruguayan winemakers are experimenting with a variety of grape varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec, as well as white grapes like Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. This diverse range of wines showcases Uruguay's potential to become a significant player in the global wine market.

Uruguay's wine industry is also marked by a strong commitment to sustainability. Many wineries are embracing organic and biodynamic farming practices, focusing on preserving the environment and promoting a healthier lifestyle. This emphasis on sustainability not only benefits the ecosystem but also resonates with consumers who are increasingly conscious about the environmental impact of their food and drink choices.

In addition, Uruguay's wine tourism industry is growing, with vineyards and wineries opening their doors to visitors. Wine tours offer the opportunity to explore picturesque vineyards, sample delicious wines, and immerse oneself in Uruguayan culture. As word spreads about Uruguay's wine offerings, more tourists are expected to visit, further boosting the industry's growth.

The country's government is also supportive of the wine industry's development. Through various initiatives and incentives, the government aims to encourage investment in the sector, improve infrastructure, and promote Uruguayan wines abroad. This government backing, combined with the country's unique assets, sets Uruguay on a promising path towards becoming a leading wine destination.

In conclusion, Uruguay's combination of ideal climate, unique terroir, innovative winemakers, and commitment to sustainability makes it an exciting contender in the global wine industry. As the world continues to discover Uruguay's exceptional wines, it is likely that this small South American nation will continue to gain prominence on the global wine stage.",mistral
How non-alcoholic cocktails are shaking up the bar scene,"**Title:** How Non-Alcoholic Cocktails are Shaking Up the Bar Scene

**Subhead:** A growing trend toward sobriety and wellness prompts a shift in the drinks menu at bars worldwide.

In the heart of New York City's bustling nightlife, a new wave is sweeping through the bars, and it's not the usual cocktail of the month. The trend this time is a non-alcoholic one, with an increasing number of establishments offering a diverse selection of creative and sophisticated non-alcoholic cocktails.

The rise of the non-alcoholic cocktail can be attributed to several factors, including a growing emphasis on health and wellness, a shift in social norms, and a broader recognition of the need for alternatives for those who choose not to drink.

""We wanted to create a space where everybody feels included, regardless of their choice of beverage,"" says James Thompson, owner of The Alchemist, a popular bar in Manhattan's Lower East Side. ""We saw a gap in the market for something fresh and exciting that wasn't alcohol-based.""

Thompson's bar is just one example of the growing number of establishments catering to the demand for non-alcoholic options. From Seedlip, the world's first non-alcoholic spirits company, to the proliferation of ""mocktail"" menus at high-end bars, the non-alcoholic cocktail movement is gaining momentum.

One of the keys to the success of non-alcoholic cocktails is their ability to mimic the sensory experience of their alcoholic counterparts. This is achieved through the use of a wide range of ingredients, from botanicals and fruits to spices and bitters.

""It's all about balance and layering flavors,"" explains Thompson. ""We use a variety of techniques, such as infusions, dehydrations, and even fermentation, to create complex and nuanced flavors that are comparable to alcoholic drinks.""

The increasing popularity of non-alcoholic cocktails is also being driven by a growing awareness of the health benefits of cutting back on alcohol consumption. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), excessive alcohol use is responsible for more than 88,000 deaths in the United States each year.

By offering non-alcoholic alternatives, bars are not only catering to the growing number of people who are choosing not to drink, but they are also providing a healthier option for those who do choose to imbibe.

""We're seeing more and more people making a conscious effort to reduce their alcohol consumption, whether that's for health reasons, financial reasons, or simply because they're tired of feeling hungover the next day,"" says Thompson. ""We want to be part of that conversation and offer something for everyone.""

The non-alcoholic cocktail movement is not just a passing fad; it's a shift in the way people approach socializing and indulging. As more people prioritize their health and well-being, and as social norms continue to evolve, it's likely that non-alcoholic cocktails will become an increasingly prominent feature of the bar scene.

""It's an exciting time for the industry,"" says Thompson. ""We're just scratching the surface of what's possible with non-alcoholic cocktails, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.""

As the demand for non-alcoholic options continues to grow, it's clear that the bar scene is entering a new era. One where everyone, regardless of their drink of choice, can raise a glass to good health, good company, and a good time.",mistral
"Coronavirus threat to Tokyo 2020 is 'heartbreaking,' says surfer Kanoa Igarashi","Tokyo 2020 Olympics Face Grave Threat as Surfer Kanoa Igarashi Expresses Heartbreak

TOKYO — In a stark reminder of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics, professional surfer Kanoa Igarashi has expressed his heartbreak over the potential cancellation or postponement of the games.

Igarashi, a native of Huntington Beach, California, and a member of the Japanese national surfing team, spoke candidly about his feelings during a virtual press conference on Tuesday. ""It's really heartbreaking to see the situation we're in right now,"" he said, his voice filled with emotion. ""The Olympics have always been a dream for me, and I can't help but feel disappointed and worried about what the future holds.""

The surfer, who competed in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, expressed concern about the safety and well-being of athletes, officials, and spectators alike. ""The Olympics are about unity, sportsmanship, and friendship,"" he said. ""But right now, I'm just worried about everyone's health and safety.""

Igarashi's comments come as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, with Japan reporting over 1,000 new cases daily. The government has declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and several other prefectures, as well as implementing strict travel restrictions and closing schools and businesses.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Japanese organizers have insisted that the games will go ahead as planned, despite mounting pressure to postpone or cancel them. In a statement released on Tuesday, the IOC reiterated its commitment to holding the games this summer, but also acknowledged the challenges ahead. ""We are fully committed to realizing the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 this summer,"" the statement read. ""However, we must also be prepared for any scenario, including a postponement, and continue to work closely with the Japanese organizers, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the Japanese government, and the International Federations to ensure the health and safety of all involved.""

Igarashi's sentiment was echoed by other athletes and sports organizations, who have called for the games to be postponed or canceled altogether. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also urged caution, warning that the games could become a breeding ground for the virus.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Olympics, Igarashi remains hopeful that the games will go ahead in some form. ""I know that everyone involved is working hard to make sure that the Olympics can happen,"" he said. ""But we also need to be realistic and understand that the situation is constantly changing. I just hope that whatever decision is made, it's the right one for everyone involved.""

Igarashi's comments serve as a stark reminder of the impact the coronavirus has had on the sports world and the dreams of athletes around the world. As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will go ahead as planned or be postponed or canceled.

In the meantime, Igarashi and other athletes will continue to train and prepare, hoping for a positive outcome and a chance to compete on the world stage. ""I just want to thank everyone for their support and understanding during this difficult time,"" he said. ""I can't wait to get back in the water and represent Japan at the Olympics, whenever that may be.""",mistral

Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus,"**World Leaders Face Uncertainty as Officials Test Positive for Virus**

In a series of unsettling developments, high-ranking officials from several countries have tested positive for the virus, raising concerns about the health and well-being of world leaders.

The first confirmed case was reported in the United Kingdom, where a senior member of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, Michael Gove, tested positive last week. Gove, who serves as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and is a member of the Cabinet, has been self-isolating and continues to work from home.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said, ""The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has tested positive for coronavirus. He is self-isolating in accordance with the guidelines, and will continue to work from home.""

The news comes as Johnson himself spent several days in intensive care earlier this year after contracting the virus. Johnson's experience with the virus has been a cautionary tale for world leaders, and his recovery has been closely watched by officials around the globe.

In another blow to the British government, Health Secretary Matt Hancock also tested positive for the virus this week. Hancock, who oversees the country's response to the pandemic, is currently self-isolating at home.

Across the Atlantic, the White House has also been hit hard by the virus. Several senior advisors, including Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, have tested positive for the virus in recent weeks.

Pence, who is responsible for leading the federal government's coronavirus task force, has continued to work from the White House. However, he has been criticized for not wearing a mask in public, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendations.

In a statement, Pence said, ""Despite the fact that I'm tested for Covid-19 seven days a week, and weekends, I've tested positive. I remain in good health and, I want to pledge to every American that I will continue in the discharge of my duties without missing a beat.""

The virus has also made its way to the Kremlin, where several senior officials have tested positive in recent weeks. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic, tested negative for the virus earlier this month.

The news of the positive tests has raised concerns about the health and well-being of world leaders, as well as the stability of their respective governments. It has also highlighted the ongoing challenges posed by the virus, which has infected over 50 million people worldwide and killed more than 1.2 million.

In response to the growing number of cases, many governments have implemented new measures to curb the spread of the virus, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mask mandates. However, these measures have been met with resistance in some quarters, with some critics arguing that they infringe on civil liberties and cause economic harm.

As the pandemic continues to rage, world leaders will need to navigate a delicate balance between protecting their citizens and preserving their own health. The news of the positive tests serves as a reminder that no one is immune to the virus, and that it continues to pose a significant threat to public health.

In the coming weeks and months, the world will be closely watching the health and well-being of world leaders, and the measures they take to protect themselves and their citizens. The pandemic has already caused immense suffering and upheaval, and it remains to be seen how world leaders will respond to this latest challenge.

For now, the world can only hope that those who have tested positive for the virus make a quick and full recovery, and that the virus can be brought under control before it causes any further harm.",mistral
Turkey: Boy saves puppy trapped in oil well,"Title: Turkey: Boy Saves Puppy Trapped in Oil Well

An extraordinary act of bravery from a young Turkish boy has captured the hearts of the nation, as he successfully rescued a puppy trapped deep within an oil well.

Nine-year-old Ali Yildirim from the city of Bursa found himself in an unexpected heroic role when he heard the distressed whimpering of a puppy coming from a nearby oil well last Tuesday. The well, owned by a local energy company, had been idle for several months, making it an unlikely place for a puppy to find itself in such a perilous situation.

Ali, a fifth-grader with a keen interest in animals, immediately sprang into action. He gathered a group of friends and together, they devised a plan to save the trapped puppy. Armed with little more than determination and makeshift tools, they set out to rescue the innocent creature.

For over six hours, the group worked tirelessly, lowering a rope equipped with a custom-made hook into the depths of the well. It was a nail-biting wait as they listened intently for any sound that might indicate they were getting closer to the puppy.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they heard the faint whimpers they'd been searching for. With a collective gasp, they pulled the rope taut, and the hook snagged onto something small and furry.

With a mixture of relief and excitement, they carefully lifted the puppy to the surface. Splattered in oil and visibly shaken, the puppy was immediately wrapped in a blanket by Ali, who cradled the animal in his arms.

The local community has hailed Ali as a hero, praising his quick thinking and selflessness. The puppy, now named ""Oilwell"" in honor of the event, is currently receiving care from a local animal shelter.

The energy company that owns the oil well has also commended Ali for his actions, promising to take steps to prevent such incidents in the future. They have offered to cover the costs of Oilwell's care and rehabilitation, as well as a financial reward for Ali and his family.

Ali, however, remains humble about his actions. ""I just wanted to help,"" he said, beaming with pride. ""I love animals, and I couldn't just stand by and watch one suffer.""

This heartwarming tale of courage and compassion serves as a reminder of the extraordinary things that can happen when individuals choose to take action in the face of adversity. Ali Yildirim's heroic actions have not only saved the life of a puppy but also inspired a community and captured the hearts of people across Turkey.",mistral
Australian paper prints blank pages to help tackle toilet paper shortage,"Title: Australian Paper Prints Blank Pages to Aid Toilet Paper Shortage

In an unprecedented move, Australian printing company Tasmanian Paper Mills (TPM) has announced it will temporarily halt the production of newspapers and magazines to divert resources towards the manufacturing of toilet paper. The decision comes as the country continues to grapple with a crippling shortage of the essential household item.

In a bid to alleviate the scarcity, TPM will produce 20,000 rolls of toilet paper daily instead of its usual 10,000 rolls of newspapers and 5,000 rolls of magazines. The company hopes that this measure will help ease the strain on supermarkets and other retailers, providing much-needed relief to consumers.

""We understand the critical importance of toilet paper in everyday life, and we want to do our part in ensuring its availability for all Australians,"" said TPM's CEO, John Smith. ""By temporarily halting the production of newspapers and magazines, we can divert our resources to produce more toilet paper, helping to ease the current shortage.""

The shortage of toilet paper was fueled by panic buying and hoarding as fears of the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the nation. As a result, many households found themselves facing empty shelves at their local supermarkets. The situation became so dire that some Australians resorted to buying toilet paper online, only to find that it was also out of stock.

In response to the crisis, the Australian government has stepped in to help stabilize the market. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced measures to increase the production of toilet paper, including waiving certain regulations and providing financial support to manufacturers.

""We are working closely with industry to ensure there is enough toilet paper available for all Australians,"" said Morrison. ""The Tasmanian Paper Mills' decision to temporarily halt the production of newspapers and magazines is a great example of how businesses can play their part in addressing this issue.""

Australia's major supermarket chains have also implemented measures to manage the toilet paper shortage. Coles and Woolworths have introduced purchase limits on toilet paper, while IGA has introduced a priority shopping hour for the elderly and vulnerable.

While the situation remains challenging, there are signs that the shortage may be easing. In a statement, TPM indicated that it had already seen an improvement in the availability of toilet paper in stores. ""We are hopeful that our efforts, along with those of the government and other retailers, will help to normalize the situation in the coming weeks,"" said Smith.

In the meantime, TPM has encouraged Australians to adopt a more mindful approach to their toilet paper consumption. ""We are asking people to only buy what they need and to resist the temptation to stockpile,"" said Smith. ""By doing so, we can help ensure that everyone has access to this essential item.""

The situation with the toilet paper shortage is a stark reminder of the importance of community spirit and collaboration. As Australia continues to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is heartening to see businesses, governments, and individuals coming together to find solutions.",mistral
US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"**Urban Forests in Crisis: US Cities Lose 36 Million Trees Annually**

In a stark reminder of the impact of human activity on the environment, a new study reveals that American cities are losing approximately 36 million trees each year. This alarming figure, reported by the US Forest Service, underscores the pressing need to address urban deforestation and its far-reaching consequences.

The primary cause of this tree loss is development, as cities expand and make way for buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Climate change, disease, and pests also contribute to the decline of urban forests, exacerbating the problem.

**Why Should We Care?**

Trees play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy and sustainable urban environment. They absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, helping to mitigate climate change. According to the Arbor Day Foundation, urban trees absorb roughly 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per year, which equates to the emissions from a car driven 18,000 miles.

Moreover, trees provide essential habitat for wildlife, especially in urban areas where natural habitats are often scarce. They also help reduce air pollution by filtering out harmful particles and releasing oxygen. Additionally, trees offer numerous social and economic benefits, including increased property values, reduced energy costs, and improved mental health and well-being.

**What Can Be Done?**

To combat urban deforestation and preserve our urban forests, several strategies can be employed.

1. **Urban Planning:** Encouraging sustainable urban planning practices can help protect existing trees and promote tree planting in new developments. This could involve setting aside green spaces, implementing tree protection measures during construction, and incentivizing the use of environmentally friendly materials.

2. **Public Education:** Raising awareness about the importance of urban forests can motivate individuals and communities to take action. This could involve educational programs, public events, and social media campaigns.

3. **Tree Planting:** Planting new trees is a straightforward way to replace those lost to development or other causes. Communities can organize tree-planting events, adopt-a-tree programs, and provide resources for private tree planting.

4. **Policy Changes:** Advocating for policies that prioritize tree conservation and reforestation can help ensure the long-term health of urban forests. This could involve lobbying local governments, supporting relevant legislation, and collaborating with environmental organizations.

As urban populations continue to grow, the need to protect and expand our urban forests becomes increasingly urgent. By taking action now, we can preserve the many benefits trees provide and ensure a greener, healthier future for our cities.",mistral
"Brazilian president's press secretary tests positive for coronavirus, days after meeting Trump","**Brazilian President's Press Secretary Tests Positive for Coronavirus, Days After Meeting Trump**

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - The press secretary for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, just days after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House.

Fabiola Michelini, who was part of the Brazilian delegation during Trump's visit to the country last week, confirmed her diagnosis in a tweet on Tuesday.

""I received the result of the coronavirus test. I am positive. I am in quarantine and taking the prescribed medication. I will follow the recommendations of the health authorities and rest,"" she wrote in Portuguese.

Michelini's diagnosis comes as Brazil experiences a surge in coronavirus cases. The country reported a record-breaking 1,189 deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, bringing the total number of fatalities to over 70,000.

The Brazilian government has faced criticism for its handling of the pandemic, with Bolsonaro himself downplaying the severity of the virus and opposing lockdown measures.

Bolsonaro's meeting with Trump last week has raised concerns about potential coronavirus transmission. The two leaders did not wear masks during their meeting, and Trump later tested positive for COVID-19.

Trump's diagnosis has prompted a flurry of testing among his inner circle and those who had been in close contact with him. Several White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and members of the Secret Service, have tested negative.

Michelini's diagnosis has also raised questions about the safety measures taken during Trump's visit to Brazil. The U.S. president met with Bolsonaro in the Palace of the Governors in Brasília, as well as at a rally in the city of Manaus.

Brazilian government officials have said that they followed all recommended safety protocols during the visit, including wearing masks and social distancing. However, footage from the events showed that many attendees were not wearing masks, and there were large crowds gathered in close proximity to one another.

The news of Michelini's diagnosis has sparked outrage in Brazil, with many criticizing the government for its response to the pandemic.

""This is a disaster. The government has no plan, no strategy, and no leadership. They are putting lives at risk,"" said Renata Souza, a public health expert and professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais.

Bolsonaro himself has downplayed the severity of the virus, claiming that it is no worse than the flu. He has also opposed lockdown measures, arguing that they are harmful to the economy.

The Brazilian president has tested negative for COVID-19 multiple times, but he has been criticized for his previous close contact with infected individuals. Last month, Bolsonaro attended a birthday party for a supporter who later tested positive for the virus.

The White House has not confirmed whether Trump and Bolsonaro will have any further contact, but the two leaders have maintained a close relationship. Trump has praised Bolsonaro for his handling of the pandemic, despite the surge in cases in Brazil.

The news of Michelini's diagnosis has raised concerns about the potential spread of the virus between the two countries. The U.S. is currently experiencing a resurgence in cases, with over 8 million cases and more than 220,000 deaths from COVID-19.

Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"Title: Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion Signals a New Age for Chinese Architecture

In the heart of Beijing's bustling Chaoyang District, a distinctly modern architectural marvel now stands, offering a captivating fusion of Eastern aesthetics and Western design principles. Known as the Serpentine Pavilion, this temporary structure, made in collaboration between British-Iraqi architect, Murad Abbas, and Chinese design studio, XU TA, is more than just a breathtaking piece of artistry – it's a powerful symbol of a burgeoning evolution in Chinese architecture.

The Serpentine Pavilion, an annual commission organized by London’s Serpentine Gallery, has in the past showcased architectural wonders from the likes of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, and Bjarke Ingels. This year's edition, however, marks a significant shift, with the first-ever Chinese design team selected to create the pavilion. The selection signifies a growing recognition of Chinese architectural talent on the global stage, and more importantly, a new wave of architectural thinking that is emerging from within China.

Abbas, the lead architect of the Serpentine Pavilion, describes the design as ""a fluid, sinuous form that speaks to the traditional Chinese concept of 'qi,' the life force that flows through all things."" The structure, composed of 23,000 individually engineered and joined bamboo poles, undulates gracefully like the serpentine river for which the pavilion is named. From a distance, it appears as a continuous, organic shape. Up close, however, the intricate arrangement of bamboo poles reveals the meticulous craftsmanship that went into its creation.

The choice of bamboo, a material that has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese architecture, is a deliberate nod to the country's rich architectural history. Yet, the innovative way in which it has been employed in the Serpentine Pavilion demonstrates the potential for traditional materials to be reimagined in contemporary design. XU TA, the Beijing-based design studio, has pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved using bamboo, creating a structure that is both aesthetically striking and structurally sound.

The Serpentine Pavilion's design also reflects a growing trend in Chinese architecture towards sustainability and eco-friendliness. Bamboo, being a fast-growing, renewable resource, is an ideal material for buildings that seek to minimize their environmental impact. Moreover, the pavilion is designed to be dismantled and reassembled elsewhere after its run in Beijing, ensuring that its carbon footprint remains as minimal as possible.

The Serpentine Pavilion's success in China has sparked conversations about the future of Chinese architecture. For too long, the country has been known for its monumental, neoclassical structures, such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. While these iconic landmarks are undeniably impressive, they represent a relatively limited range of architectural styles. The Serpentine Pavilion, on the other hand, showcases the diverse talents and innovative ideas that are emerging within the Chinese architectural community.

As China continues to grow and modernize, its architectural landscape is poised to undergo a dramatic transformation. The Serpentine Pavilion, with its fusion of Eastern aesthetics and Western design principles, serves as a powerful symbol of this change. It is a testament to the potential for Chinese architecture to evolve, adapting traditional materials and techniques to modern design challenges while preserving its unique cultural identity.

In conclusion, the Serpentine Pavilion is more than just a temporary structure; it is a beacon of hope for a new era in Chinese architecture. As the world watches China's architectural evolution unfold, it is worth remembering that the future of architecture lies not in replicating the past, but in embracing the infinite possibilities of the present. The Serpentine Pavilion stands as a powerful reminder that when cultures collaborate and innovate, the result can be a truly remarkable fusion of art, technology, and tradition.",mistral

The other gun lobby,"Title: ""The Other Gun Lobby: Advocating for Gun Safety and Regulation""

In the ongoing debate surrounding gun rights and regulations, a lesser-known but equally passionate group has emerged: The other gun lobby. While the National Rifle Association (NRA) and similar organizations have long been the face of gun advocacy, this new group is working tirelessly to promote gun safety, education, and stricter regulations.

The other gun lobby, a coalition of individuals and organizations, includes parents, educators, law enforcement, and public health professionals. They argue that the right to bear arms should not come at the expense of public safety. Their primary focus is on reducing gun violence, particularly in communities plagued by high rates of crime and accidental shootings.

One of the key initiatives of the other gun lobby is the advocacy for universal background checks. They argue that this simple measure would help prevent gun sales to individuals with a history of violence, mental illness, or criminal activity. Despite widespread support among the general public, this measure has repeatedly stalled in Congress.

Another key issue for the other gun lobby is the proliferation of assault weapons. They argue that these weapons, designed for military use, have no place in civilian hands and contribute significantly to gun violence. They advocate for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as stricter regulations on their sale and possession.

The other gun lobby also places a heavy emphasis on education and responsible gun ownership. They advocate for mandatory safety courses for all gun owners, as well as programs to teach children about the dangers of guns and how to react if they encounter one. They believe that by promoting responsible gun ownership, they can help reduce accidental shootings and suicides.

Perhaps the most controversial proposal from the other gun lobby is the idea of a national gun registry. They argue that a registry would help law enforcement trace guns used in crimes, making it easier to solve cases and bring criminals to justice. While this proposal is highly contentious, proponents argue that it would be a valuable tool in the fight against gun violence.

Despite their growing influence, the other gun lobby faces significant challenges. They are often outspent and outmaneuvered by the NRA and other gun rights groups. They also face opposition from gun owners who fear that stricter regulations will infringe on their rights.

However, the other gun lobby remains undeterred. They argue that their goal is not to take away guns from law-abiding citizens, but to make our communities safer. They point to countries with stricter gun laws, such as Japan and Australia, as examples of what is possible when gun safety takes priority.

In conclusion, the other gun lobby is a coalition of individuals and organizations working to promote gun safety, education, and stricter regulations. They advocate for universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, mandatory safety courses, and a national gun registry. While they face significant challenges, they remain committed to their mission: making our communities safer from the scourge of gun violence.",mistral

"'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert","**Title:** ""'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert""

**Subtitle:** A deep dive into the centuries-old recipe of Macao's iconic Pasteis de Nata

**Image:** Close-up shot of a freshly baked Pasteis de Nata with a golden, flaky crust and a creamy, caramelized egg custard interior

In the heart of Macao, where the East meets the West, a sweet symphony of tradition and innovation echoes through the bustling streets. This unique fusion is most evident in the city's culinary scene, particularly in the iconic Pasteis de Nata – a dessert that has withstood the test of time and remains as vibrant and alluring as ever.

The Pasteis de Nata, or Portuguese custard tarts, are Macao's most famous dessert, and their enduring popularity can be attributed to a carefully guarded secret: the recipe. While the ingredients might seem simple – eggs, sugar, cream, and a touch of cinnamon – the art of creating the perfect Pasteis de Nata lies in the method, a closely guarded family secret passed down through generations.

""Like the tart, I never change,"" says Maria do Carmo, the matriarch of the famed Lord Stow's Bakery, one of the city's most popular spots for Pasteis de Nata. ""The recipe has been with my family for over 300 years, and I will always stick to it.""

The origins of the Pasteis de Nata can be traced back to the 16th century, when Catholic monks in Portugal's Jerónimos Monastery began making egg tarts as a way to use up egg whites left over from starching their robes. The tarts quickly gained popularity, and when the Portuguese arrived in Macao, they brought the recipe with them.

Over the centuries, the Pasteis de Nata has evolved, with each bakery adding its own twist to the classic recipe. However, the essence of the tart – its rich, creamy filling and flaky, golden crust – remains the same.

At Lord Stow's Bakery, the process of making the Pasteis de Nata is a labor of love. The dough is made fresh daily, with a secret blend of flour, butter, and sugar. The filling is a delicate balance of eggs, cream, and sugar, cooked to perfection in the oven until it achieves a caramelized, golden-brown shade.

""It's all about patience and precision,"" explains Maria do Carmo. ""The filling must be cooked slowly and evenly, and the pastry must be baked until it's golden and crisp.""

The secret to the Pasteis de Nata's creamy filling lies in the cooking time. According to Maria do Carmo, the filling must be cooked for exactly 25 minutes at 205°C (400°F) to achieve the perfect consistency. Any shorter, and the filling will be runny; any longer, and it will become overcooked and grainy.

The Pasteis de Nata has become more than just a dessert in Macao; it's a symbol of the city's rich history and cultural diversity. And while the recipe may be shrouded in secrecy, one thing is certain: the Pasteis de Nata is here to stay, a testament to the enduring power of tradition and the unyielding spirit of Macao.

One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government,"Title: ""One of India's Biggest Banks Rescued by the Government""

New Delhi, India - In a historic move to stabilize the financial sector, the Indian government has nationalized Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC Bank) following a liquidity crisis and governance lapses. The move comes as the bank's depositors scrambled for their savings, and the government sought to restore confidence in the banking system.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took over the management of PMC Bank on Friday, October 23, citing a ""serious deterioration"" in the bank's financial health. The RBI's decision to nationalize the bank comes after a report by an audit firm revealed irregularities, including loans given to a single borrower that exceeded the bank's regulatory limits.

The RBI has appointed a deputy governor, T. Rabi Sankar, as the administrator of the bank. In a statement, Sankar assured depositors that their funds are safe and that the RBI will take necessary measures to protect their interests.

""We understand the concerns of depositors and the need to restore their confidence in the banking system. We assure them that their deposits are safe, and we will take all necessary measures to protect their interests,"" Sankar said.

The nationalization of PMC Bank marks the second time in six years that the Indian government has taken control of a major bank. In 2015, the government nationalized four banks as part of a broader effort to clean up the banking sector and boost economic growth.

The banking sector in India has been grappling with a series of challenges, including non-performing loans (NPLs), weak corporate governance, and declining profitability. The crisis at PMC Bank is particularly concerning as it is one of the largest urban co-operative banks in India, with over 8.5 million customers and assets of approximately $6 billion.

The RBI has ordered a forensic audit of the bank's books to determine the extent of the irregularities and to identify any potential wrongdoing. The audit will also scrutinize the bank's loan portfolio and assess its asset quality.

The crisis at PMC Bank has sent shockwaves through the banking sector, and raised concerns about the health of other urban co-operative banks. The Indian government has vowed to take swift action to address the crisis and restore confidence in the banking system.

""The government is fully committed to protecting the interests of depositors and to ensuring the stability of the banking sector. We will take all necessary steps to address the crisis at PMC Bank and to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future,"" said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

The government has also announced measures to protect depositors, including an increase in the deposit insurance coverage from $25,000 to $5 lakh (500,000) for each depositor. The move is expected to provide relief to depositors of PMC Bank, who have been worried about their savings since the crisis erupted.

The crisis at PMC Bank is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the Indian banking sector. The government's move to nationalize the bank is a bold step towards addressing the crisis, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to restore confidence in the banking system and to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.

As the RBI continues its investigation into the bank's affairs, depositors are hoping for a swift resolution to the crisis and a return of their savings. The government, for its part, is focusing on taking measures to strengthen the banking sector and to protect the interests of depositors.

In the meantime, the Indian banking sector faces an uncertain future, with concerns about the health of other banks and the impact of the crisis on the economy. The government and the RBI will need to take decisive action to address these challenges and to ensure the stability of the banking sector in the long term.",mistral
This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power,"**Title:** This Small Island Chain is Leading the Way on Hydrogen Power

**Subtitle:** The Pacific nation of Vanuatu is leveraging its renewable energy resources to become a global pioneer in hydrogen technology.

In the heart of the South Pacific, the archipelago nation of Vanuatu is making waves in the realm of renewable energy. Famous for its pristine beaches, lush rainforests, and vibrant culture, this small island chain is now setting its sights on a larger goal: becoming a global leader in hydrogen power.

With a population of just over 280,000 spread across 83 islands, Vanuatu faces unique challenges in its quest for sustainable energy. However, its remote location and abundance of renewable resources have created an opportunity for innovation.

The government of Vanuatu, in collaboration with international partners, has embarked on an ambitious project to harness the power of hydrogen as a clean, sustainable, and locally-produced energy source. The initiative, known as the Vanuatu Hydrogen Energy Project (VHEP), is expected to revolutionize the energy landscape of the nation and serve as a model for other small island states grappling with the dual challenges of energy security and climate change.

At the core of the VHEP is the production of green hydrogen, a zero-emission fuel generated through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources. The project aims to establish a 5-megawatt electrolyzer, powered by solar and wind energy, to produce green hydrogen for various applications, including transportation, industrial processes, and electricity storage.

The VHEP also includes the construction of a hydrogen refueling station for fuel cell vehicles, the development of a hydrogen-powered ferry, and the establishment of a hydrogen-based agriculture project to boost food security and reduce emissions from traditional agricultural practices.

The project is spearheaded by the Vanuatu Hydrogen Energy Corporation (VHEC), a joint venture between the Vanuatu government, the Japanese firm J-Power, and the Australian company Hydrogen Energy Limited. The VHEC is working closely with various stakeholders, including local communities, research institutions, and international organizations, to ensure the successful implementation of the VHEP.

The VHEP is not only a testament to Vanuatu's commitment to sustainability but also a powerful demonstration of the potential of small island states to lead the way in the global transition to green energy. By embracing hydrogen technology, Vanuatu is not only addressing its own energy needs but also contributing to the global efforts to combat climate change and pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future.

As the world grapples with the challenges posed by climate change, Vanuatu's ambitious hydrogen project offers a glimmer of hope. By leveraging its renewable resources and embracing innovative technologies, this small island nation is demonstrating that even the smallest countries can play a significant role in shaping the global energy landscape.

In the coming years, the eyes of the world will be on Vanuatu as it continues to push the boundaries of renewable energy and lead the way in hydrogen power. As the project progresses, it is hoped that Vanuatu's successes will inspire other small island states to follow suit and embark on their own hydrogen journeys, paving the way for a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future for all.",mistral
"India identifies 29 coronavirus cases as global infections top 95,000","**India Identifies 29 New Coronavirus Cases as Global Infections Top 95,000**

In a concerning development, India has reported 29 new cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), taking the total number of confirmed cases to 66, the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced on Wednesday.

The new cases were detected in Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. The majority of the cases are linked to travel history, with most patients having returned from affected countries such as Iran, Italy, and Oman.

""We are closely monitoring the situation and taking all necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus,"" said Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, during a press conference.

The Indian government has taken several steps to combat the spread of the virus, including suspending all visas, barring a few categories, until April 15, and advising citizens against all non-essential travel abroad.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the global number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed 95,000, with over 3,200 deaths. The highest number of cases have been reported in China (80,151), followed by Italy (4,636), and South Korea (3,150).

In response to the growing number of cases, the WHO declared the coronavirus a pandemic on Wednesday. ""We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic,"" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.

Dr. Tedros emphasized that while the virus has pandemic potential, it does not mean that countries should give up fighting it. ""We can change the course of this pandemic,"" he said. ""We can slow it, we can stop it, and we can prevent infections and save lives.""

As the global community grapples with the pandemic, health experts are urging people to take precautions such as washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and wearing masks in public places.

In India, the government has also urged people to follow good hygiene practices and maintain social distancing. ""It's important for everyone to be calm but also vigilant,"" said Dr. Vardhan. ""We must all do our part to prevent the spread of the virus.""

The Indian government has also set up a dedicated helpline (1075) for people to seek information about the virus and has launched an online platform (Aarogya Setu) to track the spread of the virus.

As the number of cases continues to rise globally, experts predict that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. However, with concerted efforts from governments, health organizations, and individuals, there is hope that the spread of the virus can be controlled.

In the meantime, the Indian government has reassured citizens that it is doing everything in its power to contain the spread of the virus and protect its citizens. ""We are prepared and we are ready to face any challenge,"" said Dr. Vardhan. ""We urge everyone to stay calm and follow the guidelines issued by the health authorities.""

The Indian government has also requested the international community to work together to combat the pandemic. ""This is a global crisis and requires a global response,"" said Dr. Vardhan. ""We must all stand united in our fight against this virus.""

As the world watches the situation unfold, it is clear that the coronavirus pandemic is a complex and evolving crisis that requires a coordinated response from all nations. Only by working together can we hope to overcome this challenge and ensure a safe and healthy future for all.",mistral
Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets,"Title: ""Saviour of the Dead: Burying the Bodies India Forgets""

In the heart of India's bustling capital, New Delhi, a modest graveyard stands as a testament to the forgotten. A sanctuary for the unclaimed dead, this hallowed ground is the final resting place for countless souls, often lost amid the chaos of life.

Known as the ""Saviour of the Dead,"" 60-year-old Mohammad Aslam is the caretaker of this burial ground. For three decades, he has been a silent sentinel, ensuring the dignified burial of the city's forgotten, the indigent, and the unknown.

Aslam's day begins before dawn, as he sweeps the graveyard clean, tending to the graves, and preparing for the day's arrivals. His work is a labor of love, driven by a deep sense of compassion and duty. ""I do this because it's my duty to these souls,"" he says, his eyes welling up with emotion. ""They may have been forgotten by society, but they deserve a dignified farewell.""

The journey of these souls begins at the mortuary ward of a government hospital. Each unclaimed body is transported to Aslam's graveyard, where he conducts a simple, respectful burial. He provides a shroud, a grave, and a prayer, offering solace in the absence of family or friends.

The graveyard is a quiet oasis amid the city's cacophony. Row upon row of simple, unmarked graves stretch out, each a silent reminder of a life once lived. The graves are marked only by a number, reflecting the anonymity that accompanies death for many of the city's poor and marginalized.

Aslam's work is not without challenges. He faces societal stigma, as death is often viewed as a taboo in India. Despite this, he remains undeterred, driven by his belief in the sanctity of life and death.

His tireless efforts have not gone unnoticed. Over the years, he has received various awards and recognitions, including the Padma Shri, one of India's highest civilian awards. Yet, for Aslam, these accolades pale in comparison to the satisfaction he derives from his work.

""I don't do this for recognition,"" he says. ""I do it because it's the right thing to do.""

Aslam's story is a poignant reminder of the dignity and respect that every human being deserves, even in death. His selfless service stands as a beacon of hope and compassion in a world often overshadowed by indifference and neglect.

As the sun sets over the graveyard, casting long shadows across the rows of graves, Aslam continues his daily ritual. With each shovelful of earth, he carries on the legacy of a silent savior, ensuring that the forgotten are never truly lost.

In a city of over 20 million people, Mohammad Aslam stands as a solitary sentinel, a testament to the power of compassion and the enduring dignity of the human spirit. His work serves as a stark reminder that even in the midst of chaos and forgetfulness, there exists a beacon of hope, a sanctuary for the lost souls, and a Saviour of the Dead.",mistral
Senegal partners with UK lab to develop a hand-held coronavirus test kit,"**Senegal Partners with UK Lab to Develop Hand-held Coronavirus Test Kit**

DAKAR, Senegal — In a significant move towards combating the global coronavirus pandemic, the West African nation of Senegal has partnered with a leading UK laboratory to develop a portable, hand-held coronavirus test kit.

The collaboration between the Senegalese Institute of Research in Health and Nutrition (ISRUN) and the UK's Oxford Nanopore Technologies was announced by Senegal's Minister of Health and Social Action, Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr, during a press conference on Tuesday.

""This partnership is a testament to our commitment to innovate and adapt in the face of the unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-19,"" Minister Sarr said. ""The development of a portable, rapid diagnostic test kit will revolutionize our testing capabilities, enabling us to test more people, more quickly, and in more locations.""

The hand-held test kit, which is expected to be the size of a smartphone, will work by analyzing a sample of a person's saliva or blood using nanopore technology. Results are expected to be available within 30 minutes.

Oxford Nanopore Technologies, a pioneer in the development of portable DNA and RNA analysis devices, has already developed similar technology for the detection of pathogens like Ebola and Zika.

""We are delighted to be working with ISRUN on this project,"" said Gordon Sanghera, Oxford Nanopore Technologies' Chief Executive Officer. ""The rapid, portable nature of our technology makes it ideal for use in resource-limited settings, where access to diagnostic facilities can be limited. We believe that this test kit could be a game-changer in the global fight against COVID-19.""

The development of the test kit is part of a broader effort by Senegal to enhance its capacity to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The country, which has so far reported over 17,000 cases and 392 deaths, has implemented a series of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, including a nationwide lockdown, mandatory mask-wearing, and increased testing.

""The development of this test kit is not just about Senegal; it's about Africa and the world,"" Minister Sarr said. ""We are proud to be at the forefront of this innovation, and we hope that our efforts will inspire others to join us in the fight against COVID-19.""

The partnership between ISRUN and Oxford Nanopore Technologies is expected to last for two years, with the first prototypes of the test kit expected to be ready for testing by the end of 2021. If successful, the test kit could be rolled out across Senegal and potentially other countries in West Africa and beyond.

""This is a historic moment for Senegal, and for Africa as a whole,"" said Dr. Malick Sy, the Director of ISRUN. ""We are excited to be working with Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and we are confident that together, we can develop a test kit that will make a real difference in the fight against COVID-19.""",mistral
Four women were serious candidates for president. What happened?,"Title: ""Four Women Were Serious Candidates for President. What Happened?""

In a historic first, four women vied for the highest office in the land during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The race saw a record-breaking number of women running for the Democratic nomination, yet only one ultimately secured a spot on the ballot. So, what factors led to the diminished representation of women in the final round of the race?

Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Tulsi Gabbard all garnered national attention and significant support during the primary season. Their campaigns addressed a range of issues, from healthcare reform to climate change, and each candidate sought to break barriers and challenge the status quo.

Warren, a professor and senator from Massachusetts, entered the race with a clear policy agenda and a reputation for tenacity. She proposed comprehensive plans to address wealth inequality, student loan debt, and the corruption of corporate influence in politics. Despite her strong performances in debates and impressive fundraising, Warren ultimately failed to gain traction with a broad enough base of supporters.

Harris, a former California attorney general and senator, ran a campaign centered on her experience as a prosecutor and her commitment to criminal justice reform. She also emphasized her personal story as the daughter of immigrants, positioning herself as a champion for marginalized communities. Harris's campaign, however, was often overshadowed by her debates with fellow candidate Joe Biden, where she questioned his record on race and busing. While Harris's poll numbers improved in the early stages of the race, they ultimately fell as the primary season progressed.

Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, presented herself as a pragmatic, moderate candidate with a knack for bipartisanship. She focused her campaign on issues such as healthcare, infrastructure, and education, and positioned herself as a viable alternative to the more progressive candidates in the field. Klobuchar's campaign struggled to gain momentum early on, but she saw a surge in support following a strong debate performance in December 2019. Ultimately, however, her campaign failed to sustain the momentum, and she dropped out of the race in March 2020.

Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii, ran a campaign that focused on foreign policy and diplomacy. She opposed U.S. intervention in foreign conflicts and advocated for a more isolationist approach to international relations. Gabbard's campaign received significant attention for her candidacy and her criticisms of U.S. military intervention, but her poll numbers remained low throughout the primary season.

By the time the Democratic National Convention rolled around, it was clear that former Vice President Joe Biden would be the party's nominee. While some questioned why the party had not chosen a woman as their nominee, many pointed to the challenges faced by the female candidates in the race.

Analysts and political strategists have offered a range of explanations for the diminished representation of women in the final round of the race. Some have argued that the media's focus on personality and debate performances played a significant role in shaping the race's outcome. Others have pointed to the persistent challenges faced by women in breaking through in politics, including sexism, double standards, and a lack of access to resources.

Regardless of the specific reasons, the 2020 election served as a reminder of the challenges women face in politics and the need for continued advocacy and support for women candidates. As the race for the White House heats up in the coming months, it will be important to examine the factors that led to the underrepresentation of women in the 2020 race and to work towards a more equitable and inclusive political landscape.

In the meantime, the four women who ran for president in 2020 can take pride in the ground they broke and the issues they raised. Their campaigns demonstrated the power of women's voices in politics and the importance of continuing to push for progress and representation. While the 2020 election may have fallen short in this regard, the future of American politics remains bright with the leadership and determination of women like Warren, Harris, Klobuchar, and Gabbard.",mistral
This South African pilot is on a mission to change the face of aviation in Africa,"Title: This South African Pilot is On a Mission to Change the Face of Aviation in Africa

Cape Town, South Africa - In a world where the skies are often dominated by nations with advanced aviation industries, one South African pilot is setting his sights on changing the narrative for Africa. With a passion for aviation and a vision for the continent's future, 35-year-old Tshepo Mokhosi is spearheading a movement to make the skies more accessible to African pilots and to foster a new generation of aviation professionals.

Mokhosi, who has amassed over 3,000 hours of flying experience, started his journey in the cockpit as a commercial pilot for South African Airways. However, he soon realized that there was a significant lack of representation and opportunities for African pilots within the industry. Recognizing this gap, Mokhosi decided to take action and establish the African Aviation Academy (AAA) in 2019.

Located in Johannesburg, the AAA offers comprehensive pilot training programs to young Africans, with a focus on providing scholarships to those who cannot afford the high costs associated with aviation education. Mokhosi believes that by investing in the next generation of African pilots, he can help create a more diverse and inclusive aviation industry, both on the continent and globally.

""The aviation industry has a significant impact on economic growth and development,"" Mokhosi said. ""By providing opportunities for African pilots, we are not only empowering individuals but also contributing to the broader development of our continent.""

Mokhosi's vision for the AAA extends beyond just pilot training. The academy also aims to address the broader challenges facing the aviation industry in Africa, such as a lack of maintenance facilities, aged aircraft, and insufficient air traffic control systems. To achieve this, the AAA collaborates with various stakeholders, including governments, airlines, and international organizations, to champion for policy changes and infrastructure investments.

One of the academy's most notable achievements has been its partnership with Airbus, which has provided funding for scholarships and technical support. The collaboration has enabled the AAA to expand its training capabilities and reach more students, bringing the dream of flying within reach for many young Africans.

""Tshepo's vision for the African Aviation Academy is truly inspiring,"" said Airbus South Africa President, Christian Scherer. ""We are proud to support his mission and believe that it will have a lasting impact on the aviation industry in Africa.""

As Mokhosi continues to advocate for change, he remains hopeful that his efforts will help to transform the face of aviation in Africa. He encourages young Africans to pursue their dreams, regardless of the barriers they may face, and to believe in the power of their potential to make a difference.

""The sky is not just a limit; it's a destination,"" Mokhosi said. ""And I believe that with the right opportunities, African pilots can soar to new heights and contribute to a brighter future for our continent.""

With the African Aviation Academy and pilots like Tshepo Mokhosi leading the way, the skies above Africa may soon be filled with a new generation of aviators, ready to take flight and make their mark on the world.",mistral
Do I need a flu shot?,"Title: Do I Need a Flu Shot?

As the chilly winter months approach, the question of whether to get a flu shot becomes increasingly relevant. Here's what you need to know about the flu vaccine and its importance.

The flu, or influenza, is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses. It can lead to serious complications, hospitalization, and even death, particularly for the very young, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a yearly flu vaccine for virtually everyone six months and older.

The flu vaccine is designed to protect against the three or four strains of influenza viruses that research suggests will be most common during the upcoming season. The formulation of the vaccine is based on the global surveillance of flu viruses and expert prediction about which strains will dominate in the upcoming season.

The flu shot cannot give you the flu, as it contains inactivated viruses that cannot replicate. Some people may experience mild side effects such as soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, low-grade fever, or aches. However, these symptoms are typically mild and short-lived.

It's important to note that the flu vaccine's effectiveness can vary from year to year and from person to person. Although no vaccine is 100% effective, the CDC states that flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu-related hospitalizations among all age groups, and the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions among children.

The benefits of getting a flu shot extend beyond individual protection. Vaccination helps to reduce the spread of flu viruses in the community, thereby protecting those who are vulnerable and cannot be vaccinated, such as infants under six months old. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself but also helping to protect those around you.

The best time to get a flu shot is before the flu season begins, ideally by the end of October. However, getting vaccinated later can still provide protection. The flu season can last as late as May, so it's never too late to get vaccinated.

If you have concerns or questions about the flu vaccine, it's a good idea to discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can address any specific questions or concerns you may have and help you make an informed decision.

In conclusion, getting a flu shot is an important step in protecting yourself and others from the potentially serious complications of the flu. The CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone six months and older. By getting vaccinated, you can help reduce the spread of flu viruses in your community and protect those who are at higher risk. Consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best vaccination plan for you.",mistral

BMW redesigns its iconic logo,"**BMW Unveils Redesigned Iconic Logo**

Munich, Germany - Bavarian luxury automaker BMW has announced a significant redesign of its iconic logo, marking a new era for the brand. The update, set to be introduced globally, is aimed at further underlining the company's commitment to innovation, sustainability, and its rich heritage.

The new logo, unveiled in a low-key event at BMW Group's headquarters, maintains the original blue and white colors, but features a more modern, streamlined, and symmetrical design. The propeller emblem, a nod to the company's aircraft engine manufacturing past, now appears more sharp and balanced, reflecting BMW's focus on the future while honoring its roots.

""This redesign is an expression of our ongoing evolution as a brand,"" said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. ""We are committed to shaping the future of mobility, and this new logo symbolizes our dedication to innovation, sustainability, and our rich heritage.""

The redesigned logo will be progressively implemented across BMW's global operations, including its vehicles, dealerships, and digital platforms. The rollout is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

While the propeller emblem has been a defining feature of BMW's identity since its inception in 1916, the company has periodically updated its logo to reflect its evolution. The most recent update was in 1997, when the logo was redesigned to enhance its visibility, particularly on smaller surfaces such as vehicles.

BMW's logo redesign comes at a critical time for the automotive industry, which is grappling with the challenges posed by electrification, autonomous driving, and digitalization. The redesigned logo serves as a visual representation of BMW's commitment to these trends, as the company continues to invest heavily in electric vehicles and connected services.

In recent years, BMW has made significant strides in electrification, with models like the i3 and iX3 already in production, and more electric vehicles in the pipeline. The company has also announced plans to increase its investment in electric and autonomous driving technologies, with a focus on creating sustainable, intelligent, and emotionally engaging mobility experiences.

The redesigned logo is just one element of BMW's broader brand strategy, which aims to position the company as a leader in the future of mobility. The strategy encompasses a wide range of initiatives, from developing cutting-edge electric vehicles to exploring new business models, such as ride-sharing and subscription services.

As BMW embarks on this new chapter, the redesigned logo serves as a visual reminder of the company's commitment to innovation, sustainability, and its rich heritage. The iconic propeller emblem, now more modern and symmetrical, stands as a testament to BMW's enduring spirit of forward-thinking and its unwavering dedication to shaping the future of mobility.",mistral
China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic,"Title: China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic

In a surprising turn of events, the Chinese government has accused the U.S. Army of starting the COVID-19 pandemic, a claim that has been met with skepticism by international health organizations and experts.

The allegations were made during a press conference held by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who suggested that the U.S. military may have brought the virus to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, during military games in the city late last year.

""It might be the U.S. Army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,"" Zhao tweeted, without providing any evidence to support his claim. The tweet, which has since been deleted, sparked a wave of criticism and confusion, with many questioning the basis for such a serious allegation.

The U.S. military denied the accusations, with the Defense Department stating that ""there is no factual basis to support this claim."" The World Health Organization (WHO) also dismissed the claims, stating that the organization's investigation into the origins of the virus has found no evidence of human infection with the coronavirus before December 2019.

The Chinese government's accusations come as tensions between the two countries continue to rise over a range of issues, including trade, human rights, and territorial disputes. The COVID-19 pandemic has only added fuel to the fire, with both countries blaming each other for the global health crisis.

China has faced criticism for its handling of the outbreak, with many accusing the government of covering up the initial outbreak and downplaying the severity of the virus. The Chinese government has denied these allegations, stating that it has taken swift and decisive action to combat the virus and protect its citizens.

The U.S., on the other hand, has been criticized for its response to the pandemic, with many questioning the Trump administration's handling of the crisis. The U.S. has the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in the world, and critics have accused the administration of downplaying the severity of the virus and failing to implement effective measures to mitigate its spread.

It remains to be seen how the latest round of accusations between the two countries will impact relations, but one thing is clear: the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new and unexpected battleground in an already tense relationship.

As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, international health organizations and experts are calling on all countries to work together to find the origins of the virus and develop a vaccine. The WHO has launched an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, with the aim of identifying the animal reservoir and determining how the virus made the jump to humans.

The investigation, which is being led by a team of international experts, is expected to take several months and will involve studying samples from animals in the Wuhan region, as well as examining data from the earliest cases of the virus. The WHO has stressed the importance of a thorough and transparent investigation, stating that it is critical to understanding the origins of the virus and preventing future pandemics.

In the meantime, countries around the world are working to contain the spread of the virus and protect their citizens. The global economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat and millions of people losing their jobs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a profound impact on daily life, with many people forced to stay at home and social distancing measures limiting human interaction. The virus has highlighted the importance of global cooperation and the need for countries to work together to address shared challenges.

As the investigation into the origins of the virus continues, it is hoped that the world will come together to find a solution to the pandemic and prevent future outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the world just how interconnected we are, and the need for unity and cooperation in the face of global crises.

In the end, the truth about the origins of the COVID-19 virus may never be known for certain. But one thing is clear: the virus has brought the world together in a way that few other events have, and it is up to us to learn from this experience and work together to build a better, more resilient world.",mistral
"The Catholic nun who made joyous, politically charged Pop Art","Title: The Catholic Nun Who Made Joyous, Politically Charged Pop Art

In the heart of New York City, amidst the hustle and bustle of Times Square, a unique art exhibition has taken center stage. The exhibition, aptly titled ""Sister Corita's Colorful Crusade,"" showcases the vibrant and thought-provoking works of Sister Corita Kent, a Roman Catholic nun who revolutionized the Pop Art movement with her politically charged and spiritually inspired creations.

Born Frances Elizabeth Kent in Fort Dodge, Iowa, in 1918, Sister Corita entered the Immaculate Heart of Mary order at the age of 18 and took the name Sister Corita. Her artistic talent was evident from a young age, and she pursued her passion for art while serving as a nun, teaching at the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles.

Sister Corita's art was a unique blend of Pop Art, which emerged in the mid-1950s as a reaction to the growing consumer culture, and the spiritual themes prevalent in her Catholic faith. Her works often featured bright, bold colors and popular culture references, such as advertisements and political slogans, juxtaposed with inspiring quotes and religious imagery.

One of her most famous works, ""Love: The Individual Dream,"" is a striking example of her style. The piece, created in 1967, features a multicolored, hand-painted typography of the word ""LOVE"" against a black background, with a quote from the poet e.e. cummings, ""somewhere i have never traveled, gladly beyond,"" written in white. The work is a powerful commentary on love, individuality, and the human spirit, and it continues to resonate with viewers today.

Sister Corita's art was not just visually stunning; it was also deeply political. In the 1960s, she became increasingly involved in the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, and other social justice causes. Her art served as a powerful tool for social commentary, using her platform to challenge the status quo and advocate for change.

Despite facing criticism and scrutiny from both the Church and the art world, Sister Corita remained steadfast in her beliefs and continued to create art that was both beautiful and thought-provoking. She once said, ""I am interested in only one thing, and that is doing God's work. I am not interested in doing my work God's way. I have a much larger agenda.""

The exhibition ""Sister Corita's Colorful Crusade"" is a testament to the power of art as a means of expression and social change. It serves as a reminder of Sister Corita's indomitable spirit, her unwavering commitment to her beliefs, and her unique contribution to the world of art.

As we navigate our own complex and challenging times, Sister Corita's art offers a powerful message of hope, love, and the power of the individual to make a difference. Her works continue to inspire and challenge us, reminding us that art can be a powerful force for change, and that beauty and politics can coexist in a way that is both joyous and thought-provoking.

In the words of Sister Corita herself, ""Art is a way of reaching out to people, of speaking their language, of entertaining them, of making them afraid, of making them laugh, of making them cry. Art is a way of expressing love, of expressing hatred, of expressing indifference.""

The exhibition ""Sister Corita's Colorful Crusade"" is on display at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City until August 28, 2023. For those who cannot attend in person, a comprehensive catalog of Sister Corita's works is available, offering a glimpse into the mind and heart of this incredible artist and activist.",mistral

In a rare and exclusive interview, Watford defender Christian Kabasele has offered a tantalizing glimpse into the strategies required to challenge the mighty Liverpool, currently sitting atop the Premier League table.

The Belgian international, who has been a key figure in Watford's resilient defensive unit this season, has faced Liverpool twice this campaign, with both encounters ending in narrow defeats for the Hornets. However, his experiences have equipped him with valuable insights that he generously shared with our reporters.

""Liverpool are a fantastic team,"" Kabasele began, ""They have an incredible attacking threat, with players like Salah, Mane, and Firmino who can score from anywhere. But I believe that if a team is well-organized, disciplined, and focused, there's always a way to get a result against them.""

**Tactical Approach**

According to Kabasele, the first step in beating Liverpool is understanding their unique playing style and adapting accordingly. ""They like to press high and create chaos in opposition defenses,"" he explained. ""So, our aim is to keep our shape, play quick passes, and look for opportunities to counter-attack.""

Kabasele also emphasized the importance of closing down spaces and limiting Liverpool's time on the ball. ""They are dangerous when they have time and space to move the ball around,"" he said. ""Our job is to make life difficult for them, force them into mistakes, and capitalize on any errors they make.""

**Teamwork and Communication**

When asked about the role of teamwork and communication in facing Liverpool, Kabasele was emphatic. ""It's crucial that everyone knows their role and sticks to it,"" he said. ""We need to be aware of each other's positions, anticipate movements, and provide support when needed.""

The defender also highlighted the importance of mental toughness and resilience. ""Liverpool will have periods of dominance and create chances,"" he admitted. ""But we must remain calm, focused, and believe in ourselves. If we can weather the storm, there's always a chance to grab a goal and change the game.""

**Mindset**

Finally, Kabasele offered some words of wisdom for any team looking to challenge Liverpool. ""You have to approach the game with confidence and belief,"" he said. ""You can't be intimidated by their reputation or the quality of their players. If you believe in your abilities and are prepared to fight for every ball, you can make them uncomfortable and create opportunities for yourself.""

As the Premier League season reaches its climax, these insights from Christian Kabasele offer valuable insights for the teams chasing Liverpool. While it may be a daunting task to outwit Jurgen Klopp's formidable Reds, Kabasele's experiences and advice suggest that with the right tactics, teamwork, and mindset, it is certainly possible.

**Conclusion**

In an era where the Premier League is increasingly dominated by a select few, the challenge of beating Liverpool has become a fascinating subplot. Christian Kabasele's insights offer a unique and valuable perspective on this question, shedding light on the strategies, teamwork, and mindset required to challenge one of the world's top footballing powerhouses.

As the season reaches its climax, we can expect more exciting encounters between Liverpool and their rivals. With Kabasele's advice in mind, it will be intriguing to see which teams can rise to the challenge and claim a victory against the high-flying Reds.",mistral
"The Clanwilliam cedar survived the last ice age, but its future hangs in the balance","**Title:** The Clanwilliam Cedar: A Prehistoric Survivor on the Brink

**Subtitle:** South Africa's ancient and endangered Clanwilliam cedar faces extinction, despite surviving the last ice age.

**Main Image:** A lone Clanwilliam cedar standing amidst a barren landscape, its towering silhouette a testament to its resilience.

---

Nestled in the Cederberg Mountains of South Africa's Western Cape lies a tree that has weathered the test of time, surviving through the last ice age and bearing witness to millennia of change. The Clanwilliam cedar, Widdringtonia cedarbergensis, is a relic of a bygone era, a species that has managed to persist against all odds. Yet, the future of this ancient tree remains uncertain, as it faces the very real threat of extinction.

The Clanwilliam cedar is a slow-growing, coniferous tree, characterized by its distinctive, twisted branches and small, bluish-green needles. It is one of the rarest and most endangered trees in the world, with only an estimated 130 mature individuals remaining in the wild. The tree's small population size, coupled with habitat fragmentation and a host of threats such as drought, fire, and invasive species, have led conservationists to classify the Clanwilliam cedar as critically endangered.

The tree's resilience can be traced back to the last ice age, which occurred approximately 2.6 million years ago. During this period, much of the world was covered in ice, and the Clanwilliam cedar was one of the few plants that could survive in the harsh, cold conditions. The tree's small size, slow growth rate, and ability to store water in its trunk allowed it to withstand the harsh climate and persist in isolated pockets of habitat.

Today, however, the Clanwilliam cedar faces a different set of challenges. Climate change, in particular, has had a significant impact on the tree's habitat, as rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns have led to increased drought and wildfire risk. These factors have further fragmented the tree's habitat, making it difficult for the remaining individuals to find mates and reproduce.

In an effort to save the Clanwilliam cedar, conservationists have launched a variety of efforts, including habitat restoration, fire management, and captive breeding programs. The South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has established a seed bank to preserve the tree's seeds, while the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) has been working to remove invasive species from the tree's habitat and protect it from fire.

One of the most promising conservation efforts is the Clanwilliam Cedar Conservation Project, a collaborative initiative between SANBI, EWT, and the Western Cape Government. The project aims to increase the number of mature Clanwilliam cedars in the wild by translocating seedlings to suitable habitats and protecting them from threats such as fire and invasive species. The project also includes a research component, which will help scientists better understand the tree's ecology and develop strategies to ensure its long-term survival.

Despite these efforts, the future of the Clanwilliam cedar remains uncertain. The tree's small population size and declining habitat quality make it a challenging species to conserve, and many fear that without significant intervention, the tree may soon disappear from the face of the earth.

For conservationists, the plight of the Clanwilliam cedar serves as a stark reminder of the importance of preserving the world's biodiversity. The tree's survival through the last ice age is a testament to its resilience, but its current struggle highlights the fragility of the natural world and the need for urgent action to protect endangered species and their habitats.

In the words of renowned conservationist Edward O. Wilson, ""The fate of humanity and the natural world are now linked, and that fate will be shaped by our actions."" The survival of the Clanwilliam cedar, like so many other endangered species, hinges on our ability to",mistral

**Headline:** Tesla's Q1 Earnings Beat Expectations, but Challenges Remain

**Subheadline:** The electric vehicle giant reported a surprise profit, but oversupply and regulatory hurdles loom large.

**Main Image:** A Tesla Model Y electric SUV on a production line at the company's factory in Fremont, California. (AP Photo/Noah Berger)

**Body:**

In a surprise move that sent Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shares soaring, the electric vehicle company reported a first-quarter profit, beating analysts' expectations by a significant margin.

The Palo Alto-based automaker reported earnings of $0.93 per share on revenue of $16.96 billion, far outpacing analysts' average estimates of $0.14 per share on revenue of $14.9 billion, according to FactSet. The company's stock price surged more than 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

Tesla's profitability was largely driven by higher-than-anticipated deliveries of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, as well as lower costs associated with its manufacturing processes. The company's gross margin also improved, reaching 24.7%, compared to 23.6% in the same quarter last year.

However, despite the positive earnings report, Tesla faces several challenges that could potentially derail its growth momentum. One of the most pressing issues is the oversupply of electric vehicles (EVs) in the market, which has led to a decrease in prices and increased competition.

According to a recent report by AlixPartners, the global EV market could see a supply surplus of up to 2 million units in 2023, due to a surge in production from traditional automakers and rising demand from consumers. This could put downward pressure on prices and profit margins for Tesla and its competitors.

Another challenge for Tesla is the regulatory landscape in various markets. The company has faced intense scrutiny from regulators in China, the EU, and the U.S., over issues such as safety, environmental impact, and labor practices.

For example, the EU recently proposed new regulations that would require electric vehicle manufacturers to ensure that their batteries are recyclable and that the minerals used in their production are ethically sourced. Tesla, which sources many of its minerals from countries with poor labor practices, could potentially face significant costs and regulatory hurdles as a result.

In addition, Tesla is facing increased competition from traditional automakers, such as General Motors, Ford, and Volkswagen, which have all announced ambitious plans to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicle production and infrastructure.

Despite these challenges, Tesla remains a dominant player in the electric vehicle market, with a market capitalization of over $700 billion and a global brand that is unmatched by its competitors. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, has consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible in the automotive industry, and many analysts believe that Tesla will continue to innovate and grow in the years ahead.

In a statement, Musk said, ""We are pleased to report a strong start to the year, with record deliveries and a significant improvement in our profitability. We are excited about the opportunities ahead, and we remain focused on delivering the best electric vehicles to our customers and driving the transition to a sustainable energy future.""

In conclusion, Tesla's Q1 earnings report was a positive development for the company, but the electric vehicle market remains highly competitive and fraught with challenges. The company will need to navigate regulatory hurdles, address oversupply issues, and fend off competition from traditional automakers to maintain its growth momentum in the years ahead.

Trump's ex-top economic adviser: US is in a recession,"Title: Trump's Ex-Top Economic Adviser: US is in a Recession

In a stark warning to the current administration and the nation, former President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has asserted that the United States is currently in a recession. Kudlow, who served as the director of the National Economic Council from 2018 to 2021, made these remarks during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

Kudlow, a long-time supporter of the Trump administration's economic policies, has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's economic strategies. He believes that the current economic downturn is a direct result of the policies implemented by the current administration.

""I think we're in a recession now,"" Kudlow said during the interview. ""I think we had a very weak first quarter, and I think we're going to have a weak second quarter."" Kudlow attributed the economic slump to the combination of high inflation, rising interest rates, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kudlow's comments come as the U.S. economy has shown signs of slowing down. The gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total output of goods and services produced by an economy, contracted by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This marked the second consecutive quarter of negative growth, which is a common definition of a recession.

The current administration has disputed the idea that the U.S. is in a recession. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, during her daily press briefing, asserted that the economy was showing signs of strength. ""We acknowledge that there are challenges, but the signs of the economy continuing to recover are clear,"" Jean-Pierre said.

Kudlow's assertion that the U.S. is in a recession is not without precedent. In the past, he has been known to downplay economic downturns and emphasize economic growth. During the 2008 financial crisis, Kudlow, who was then a talk show host, insisted that the economy was not in a recession and that the financial crisis was merely a ""bear market.""

Kudlow's criticism of the Biden administration's economic policies is not limited to the current economic slump. He has also been critical of the administration's infrastructure plan, which includes a $1 trillion investment in roads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects. Kudlow has argued that the plan would increase inflation and burden future generations with debt.

The former economic adviser's comments are likely to add to the political rhetoric surrounding the economy. The U.S. midterm elections are rapidly approaching, and both political parties are vying for control of Congress. The economy is expected to be a central issue in the elections, with both parties claiming that their policies are the key to economic recovery.

Kudlow's assertion that the U.S. is in a recession is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the state of the economy. Whether the U.S. is officially in a recession or not, the economy is showing signs of slowing down, and the political implications of this slowdown are likely to be far-reaching.

In conclusion, former President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has asserted that the United States is currently in a recession. Kudlow's comments come as the U.S. economy has shown signs of slowing down, with the GDP contracting by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022.

Pornhub's Director of Business Development, Corey Price, expressed the company's empathy for those affected by the pandemic, stating, ""We understand the challenges that Italians are facing right now, and we want to do our part to help."" He added, ""We hope that this small gesture can provide some respite and normalcy during these trying times.""

To qualify for the free premium membership, Italians need to verify their residence through the Pornhub website. Once verified, they will be granted access to the full range of premium content on the platform, which includes high-definition videos, exclusive content, and no advertisements.

This is not the first time Pornhub has offered assistance during a crisis. In 2017, the platform provided free premium memberships to residents of Puerto Rico following the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria. In 2018, Pornhub offered free premium memberships to Californians affected by the wildfires.

Pornhub's move has been met with mixed reactions. While some have praised the company for its compassionate response to the crisis, others have criticized the decision, arguing that it trivializes the seriousness of the situation.

Italy's Ministry of Health has yet to comment on Pornhub's offer, and it remains unclear whether the government will officially endorse the initiative. However, some Italian politicians have welcomed the move, with one saying, ""In times of crisis, it's important to find ways to support each other. If this helps Italians cope, then I see no problem with it.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, countries around the world are implementing strict measures to contain the virus, including lockdowns and travel restrictions. With many people now confined to their homes, companies like Pornhub are finding creative ways to provide support and entertainment during these challenging times.

For more information on the #TeamPornhubItalia initiative, visit Pornhub's official website. If you or someone you know is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, consider reaching out to local resources for support and guidance.

Stay safe, and stay informed.

What is a bear market?,"Title: What is a Bear Market?

In the ever-fluctuating world of finance, understanding market terminology is crucial for investors and financial enthusiasts alike. One such term that often sparks debate and concern is a ""bear market.""

A bear market is a significant decline in stock market indices over a period of time, usually defined as a drop of 20% or more from recent highs. This downturn is typically accompanied by widespread pessimism and negative sentiment among investors.

The origin of the term ""bear market"" can be traced back to the 18th century when London Stock Exchange traders would use bearskin capes as a symbol of their profession. When the market was bearish, traders would carry their capes reversed to show the fur, hence the term ""sell the bear skin.""

Bear markets are a natural part of the market cycle and have occurred numerous times throughout history. The most notable bear markets include the Great Depression (1929-1932), the Dot-com bubble (2000-2002), and the Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009).

While bear markets are often associated with economic downturns, they also serve a crucial purpose. They help to correct overvalued markets, restore investor sentiment, and set the stage for future growth. During a bear market, investors can take advantage of lower prices to buy undervalued stocks, strengthening their long-term investment portfolios.

However, experiencing a bear market can be challenging for investors, especially for those who are new to the market. It's essential to maintain a long-term perspective and resist the temptation to sell during market downturns. Instead, focus on the underlying fundamentals of the companies you own and the strength of your overall investment strategy.

To mitigate the impact of bear markets, diversification is key. Spreading investments across various asset classes, sectors, and geographical regions can help to reduce risk and increase the potential for returns.

In conclusion, a bear market is a period of sustained decline in the stock market, typically defined by a drop of 20% or more from recent highs. While bear markets can be unsettling, they are a natural part of the market cycle and can provide opportunities for long-term investors. By understanding the concept and maintaining a disciplined investment strategy, investors can navigate bear markets more effectively.

As always, it's recommended to consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any investment decisions. The financial markets are unpredictable, and while understanding terms like ""bear market"" can help, it's essential to approach investing with caution and a well-thought-out plan.",mistral
US conducts airstrikes against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq,"**US Conducts Airstrikes Against Iranian-Backed Militia Sites in Iraq**

Washington D.C. - The United States military conducted airstrikes against multiple sites in Iraq that were used by Iranian-backed militia groups, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday.

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said the airstrikes were in response to recent attacks on American and coalition personnel in Iraq. He added that the strikes targeted operational and weapons storage facilities used by groups that are ""threatening the safety and security of our personnel in Iraq.""

According to initial reports, the airstrikes occurred near the border with Syria and targeted facilities in the Al-Qaim and Erbil regions. The Iraqi military confirmed the strikes, stating that no Iraqi forces were harmed in the operation.

The Pentagon's announcement comes after a series of rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq, including the Erbil International Airport and the Taji military base, which housing American and coalition troops. No casualties were reported in these attacks, but they have raised tensions between the U.S. and Iranian-backed militias in the region.

The U.S. has accused Iran-backed militias of being responsible for the attacks, and the Pentagon has warned that it will take action to protect its personnel and interests in Iraq. The airstrikes mark the first significant military action by the Biden administration against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.

The Iraqi government released a statement condemning the airstrikes and calling for de-escalation in the region. The statement reiterated Iraq's commitment to maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and urged all parties to refrain from actions that could further destabilize the region.

The U.S. has maintained a military presence in Iraq since 2014, when it deployed troops to assist the Iraqi government in its fight against the Islamic State (IS) militant group. The presence of American troops in the country has been a source of tension between the U.S. and Iran, with Iranian-backed militias frequently targeting U.S. facilities and personnel.

The airstrikes come as the Biden administration is reviewing U.S. policy towards Iran. In his campaign, President Biden pledged to re-enter the Iran nuclear deal, which was abandoned by the Trump administration in 2018. The airstrikes may signal a more aggressive stance towards Iranian-backed militias in the region, but it remains to be seen how the Biden administration will approach Iran more broadly.

The airstrikes have already sparked a wave of reaction and criticism from various quarters. Iranian officials have condemned the strikes, with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif calling them a ""dangerous escalation"" and a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. The Iraqi parliament is also expected to hold an emergency session to discuss the airstrikes and their implications for Iraq's security and sovereignty.

Meanwhile, U.S. allies in the region have expressed support for the airstrikes. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have both issued statements condemning the attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq and supporting the U.S. right to defend its personnel and interests.

The airstrikes mark a significant escalation in the long-running conflict between the U.S. and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. As tensions continue to rise in the region, it remains unclear what the next steps will be for the U.S. and its allies, or for Iran and its proxies. The Biden administration has pledged to pursue a diplomatic approach to resolving the conflict, but the airstrikes suggest that military action may still be on the table.",mistral

The film, which hit theaters last week, follows two teenage elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, on a quest to bring their deceased father back for one day using a magical staff.

Directed by Dan Scanlon, who also helmed the tear-jerking ""Monsters University,"" ""Onward"" is a poignant exploration of loss, family, and the power of memories.

In the verdant heart of Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, a unique adventure is drawing thrill-seekers from around the globe. Known for its picturesque landscapes, historical sites, and culinary delights, Wakayama is now making waves in the world of extreme sports with its standing wave rafting.

Located in the Kishi River, about an hour and a half drive from Wakayama City, the standing wave rafting site is a marvel of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity. The site, operated by the Wakayama Rafting Association, features a series of artificial waves, designed to mimic the unpredictable currents and rapids found in nature.

The standout feature of this sport is the departure from traditional rafting techniques. Instead of floating passively on an inflatable raft, participants stand on specially designed logs, navigating the waves with a long paddle. It's akin to surfing, but on a river, offering a high-adrenaline experience that's both exhilarating and challenging.

""It was unlike anything I've ever done before,"" said Sarah Johnson, a visitor from California who recently tried standing wave rafting. ""The thrill of standing on the log, feeling the force of the water pushing against me, was indescribable. I felt alive in a way I never had before.""

The sport, which has been gaining popularity in recent years, is attracting both seasoned adrenaline junkies and novices looking for a new adventure. The Wakayama Rafting Association offers lessons for beginners, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants.

""Safety is our top priority,"" said Hiroshi Tanaka, the president of the Wakayama Rafting Association. ""Our instructors are experienced and skilled, and they are dedicated to ensuring that every participant has a safe and enjoyable experience.""

The standing wave rafting site is not the only attraction in the area. The Kishi River, which flows through the stunning Kii Mountain Range, offers a variety of rafting experiences, from calm floats to challenging rapids. The area is also rich in history and culture, with several temples and shrines, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.

For those looking for a taste of the local cuisine, Wakayama offers a plethora of options. From the region's famous kishu-mikan oranges to the delicious katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes), there's something for everyone.

As the sun sets over the Kishi River, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, it's easy to see why standing wave rafting in Wakayama is quickly becoming a must-do for adventure seekers. Whether you're a seasoned adrenaline junkie or a novice looking for a new challenge, Wakayama's standing wave rafting offers an experience like no other.

So, if you're ready to step out of your comfort zone and experience the thrill of standing wave rafting, pack your bags and head to Wakayama. It's on logs - and standing up!",mistral
Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"Title: Guinea-Bissau: Political Chaos Could Boost Cocaine Trade

In the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau, political instability has long been a breeding ground for illicit activities, particularly the trafficking of cocaine. As the country plunges deeper into a political crisis, experts warn that the cocaine trade could see a significant boost.

The latest development in Guinea-Bissau's political saga began on January 23rd, when President Umaro Sissoco Embaló dismissed the Prime Minister, Nuno Gomes Nabiam. The move was criticized by the opposition and international community, with many seeing it as a power grab aimed at consolidating Embaló's grip on the government.

The political instability has already had dire consequences. On February 1st, a military base in the capital, Bissau, was attacked by a group of soldiers. The attack was reportedly an attempt to assassinate the president, but it resulted in the death of at least nine people and the injury of several others.

The political crisis comes at a time when Guinea-Bissau is already struggling with one of the world's highest rates of cocaine trafficking. The tiny nation, with a population of just over 1.9 million, is strategically located on the drug route from South America to Europe.

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Guinea-Bissau is a major transshipment point for cocaine destined for European markets. The country's porous borders, lack of resources, and weak institutions make it an ideal location for drug traffickers.

The political instability is expected to exacerbate the problem. As the government struggles to maintain control, it will have less resources and manpower to combat the drug trade. This could lead to a surge in cocaine trafficking, with the potential to flood European markets.

The political crisis is also likely to lead to increased violence. Drug trafficking is already a major source of conflict in Guinea-Bissau, with rival gangs battling for control of the lucrative trade. The political instability could further fuel this violence, leading to more deaths and displacement.

The international community has expressed concern about the situation in Guinea-Bissau. The European Union, which is a major donor to the country, has warned that the political crisis could derail efforts to combat the drug trade. The United States has also expressed concern, with the State Department stating that it is closely monitoring the situation.

However, some experts question whether the international community is doing enough to address the problem. They argue that the West has a responsibility to help Guinea-Bissau stabilize its politics and combat the drug trade.

In a statement, the UNODC warned that the political crisis could have ""serious consequences"" for the fight against organized crime in West Africa. The agency called on the international community to support Guinea-Bissau in its efforts to address the drug trade and promote stability.

As Guinea-Bissau continues to grapple with political instability, the country's future looks bleak. The drug trade is a major source of income for many, and efforts to combat it have so far been unsuccessful. Unless the international community steps up its efforts to support Guinea-Bissau, the country could become increasingly unstable, and the drug trade could continue to flourish.

In conclusion, the political crisis in Guinea-Bissau poses a serious threat to the fight against the drug trade in West Africa. The country's porous borders and weak institutions make it an ideal location for drug traffickers, and the political instability is expected to exacerbate the problem. The international community has a responsibility to support Guinea-Bissau in its efforts to combat the drug trade and promote stability, before the situation spins out of control.",mistral
Schools knew of trouble before student deaths,"Title: ""Schools Knew of Trouble Before Student Deaths""

In a shocking turn of events, an investigation has revealed that multiple schools were aware of the troubled past and mental health issues of students who later took their lives, but failed to take appropriate action. The revelation has sparked a wave of outrage and calls for reform in the education system.

The investigation, led by the State Education Department, scrutinized the cases of five students from different schools across the state who died by suicide within the past year. The findings indicate that each school had received multiple warnings about the students' mental health struggles, but did not provide adequate support or intervene in a timely manner.

At [School Name 1], teachers reported that [Student Name 1] had shown signs of distress and had mentioned suicidal thoughts in class, yet no action was taken. The school's administration justified their inaction, stating that they were unaware of the severity of the student's issues and believed they were handling the situation appropriately.

Similarly, [School Name 2] had been alerted to [Student Name 2]'s struggles with depression and self-harm, but the student was not offered any counseling services until after the suicide attempt. The school has apologized for their inaction and pledged to improve their mental health support systems.

The investigation also found that [School Name 3] had failed to follow up on a referral for [Student Name 3] to a mental health professional, despite multiple requests from the student's parents. The school has admitted to their mistake and is now working to strengthen their referral process.

These incidents have led to a push for stricter accountability and improved mental health support in schools. Advocates argue that schools must prioritize the mental health of their students and take action when signs of distress are present.

""Schools have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students,"" said [Advocate Name], a mental health advocate. ""Ignoring signs of distress and failing to provide adequate support can have devastating consequences. It's time for schools to take mental health seriously and implement policies and procedures that protect our children.""

In response to the investigation's findings, the State Education Department has announced plans to create a statewide mental health training program for school staff. The program, which will be mandatory for all teachers and administrators, aims to equip school personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to recognize and respond to mental health emergencies.

The investigation has also sparked a conversation about the need for increased funding for mental health services in schools. Advocates argue that schools cannot effectively support students with mental health issues without adequate resources.

""We need to invest in our children's mental health,"" said [Politician Name], a state legislator. ""These tragedies are preventable, but we need to ensure that schools have the resources they need to provide the support students require.""

The tragic deaths of these students have shone a light on the need for reform in the education system. As the investigation continues, it is hoped that the lessons learned will lead to a safer, more supportive environment for all students.

For the families of the affected students, the pain of their loss is unbearable. They hope that the changes enacted in response to this tragedy will prevent other families from experiencing the same heartache.

""My child's life mattered,"" said [Family Member Name], the parent of one of the deceased students. ""We need to make sure that other families don't have to go through what we have.""

As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen what further changes will be made to the education system. One thing is clear, however: the tragic deaths of these students have left a lasting impact and have highlighted the urgent need for reform.

A bipartisan Buttigieg effect? The people of this gorgeous island country say yes,"Title: ""A Bipartisan Buttigieg Effect? The People of This Gorgeous Island Country Say Yes""

In a surprising twist of international politics, the visit of U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to the picturesque island nation of Malta has sparked a wave of bipartisan interest and admiration among its citizens. The charismatic secretary's visit, which focused on climate change, infrastructure, and regional cooperation, has left Maltese officials and citizens eager for continued U.S.-Malta relations.

Buttigieg's visit, which took place on July 12, marked the first high-level U.S. visit to Malta since President Joe Biden took office. The secretary's agenda was packed with meetings with Maltese President George Vella, Prime Minister Robert Abela, and other high-ranking officials. The discussions centered on various topics, including climate change, infrastructure, and regional security.

However, it was not just the high-level discussions that captivated the Maltese people. Buttigieg's charm and down-to-earth demeanor seemed to resonate with the Maltese public, with many praising his approachable and inclusive style. In a country where politics often feel distant and unapproachable, Buttigieg's ability to connect with the people was a refreshing change.

""He was so genuine and engaging,"" said Sarah Demicoli, a Maltese citizen who attended a town hall meeting with Buttigieg. ""He listened to our concerns and seemed genuinely interested in our ideas. It was a breath of fresh air.""

The secretary's focus on climate change also struck a chord with many Maltese, who are deeply concerned about the impact of rising sea levels and increased flooding on their low-lying island nation. Buttigieg's commitment to addressing climate change and his push for sustainable infrastructure were met with widespread approval.

""Climate change is an existential threat to our country,"" said Maltese Environment Minister Aaron Farrugia. ""Secretary Buttigieg's commitment to addressing this issue is inspiring, and we are eager to work with the U.S. to find solutions.""

In addition to climate change, Buttigieg's discussions with Maltese officials touched on regional cooperation and security. The secretary emphasized the importance of working together to address common challenges, such as migration and cybersecurity. Maltese officials expressed their agreement and reiterated their commitment to strengthening U.S.-Malta relations.

""Secretary Buttigieg's visit was a great opportunity to discuss how we can work together to address the challenges facing our region,"" said Maltese Foreign Minister Ian Borg. ""We look forward to continued cooperation and collaboration with the U.S.""

As Buttigieg wrapped up his visit, many Maltese were left with a renewed sense of hope for U.S.-Malta relations. The secretary's charisma, commitment to climate change, and focus on regional cooperation seemed to resonate with the Maltese people, regardless of political affiliation.

""I don't always agree with U.S. politics, but I have to admit, I was impressed with Secretary Buttigieg,"" said Maltese citizen Mark Camilleri. ""His approachable style and commitment to addressing climate change gave me hope for U.S.-Malta relations.""

As the U.S. and Malta continue to work together on various issues, it remains to be seen whether the ""Buttigieg effect"" will continue to influence Maltese politics and perceptions of the U.S. One thing is certain, however: the secretary's visit has left a lasting impression on the Maltese people, and his charisma and commitment to addressing climate change have won him many new fans on the beautiful island nation.",mistral

---

In a bold and groundbreaking move, former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has announced the formation of a new international organization aimed at combating human rights abuses around the world. The organization, tentatively named the ""Global Human Rights Alliance,"" is set to launch in early 2023, and Haley has already secured commitments from several influential global leaders.

Haley, who served as ambassador under President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2018, has long been a vocal advocate for human rights. Speaking at a press conference in New York City, she expressed her hope that the new alliance would serve as a beacon of hope for those suffering under oppressive regimes.

""For far too long, the international community has stood idly by while human rights abuses continue to occur unchecked,"" Haley said. ""The Global Human Rights Alliance will be a powerful force for change, working tirelessly to expose and combat these abuses, and to hold those responsible accountable.""

The organization will focus on a wide range of human rights issues, including freedom of speech, religious freedom, women's rights, and the rights of marginalized communities. Haley emphasized that the alliance would be non-partisan and would work closely with governments, international organizations, and human rights groups to ensure that its efforts are effective and sustainable.

One of the key features of the alliance will be its ability to mobilize rapid responses to human rights crises. Haley pointed to the ongoing genocide in Myanmar's Rohingya community as an example of the kind of situation that the alliance hopes to address. ""We cannot afford to wait for slow, bureaucratic processes to take their course when people's lives are at stake,"" she said. ""The Global Human Rights Alliance will be able to move quickly and decisively to provide aid, support, and pressure to those who are suffering.""

Haley has already secured commitments from several high-profile leaders to join the alliance, including former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. She expressed her hope that more leaders would join as the organization moves towards its official launch.

""The Global Human Rights Alliance will not be a solo effort,"" Haley said. ""It will require the support and cooperation of leaders from around the world if we are to make a real difference in the lives of those who are suffering. I am confident that we can build a coalition that will be a force for good in the world.""

In addition to its work on the ground, the alliance will also focus on advocacy and awareness-raising. Haley has pledged to use her extensive network of contacts in government and business to put pressure on those who are responsible for human rights abuses. She also plans to use social media and other digital platforms to raise awareness about human rights issues and to mobilize public support for the alliance's efforts.

The formation of the Global Human Rights Alliance has been welcomed by human rights organizations around the world. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Crisis Group have all expressed their support for the initiative. ""This is a significant and much-needed step towards addressing the global human rights crisis,"" said Ken Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. ""We look forward to working closely with Nikki Haley and her team to make a real difference in the lives of those who are suffering.""

The launch of the Global Human Rights Alliance is expected to take place in early 2023, with Haley and her team working tirelessly in the meantime to secure additional funding, partnerships, and support. With the backing of influential global leaders and the support of human rights organizations, the alliance stands a good chance of making a real difference in the world.

As Haley herself put it, ""The Global Human Rights Alliance is not just about saving lives. It's about standing up for the values that we all hold dear: freedom,",mistral
Christmas Island: 'A giant robber crab stole my camera',"**Title**: Christmas Island: 'A Giant Robber Crab Stole My Camera'

**Subtitle**: Tourists share tales of unexpected encounters with the island's native species

In the heart of the Indian Ocean, Christmas Island is a remote paradise known for its stunning beaches and vibrant marine life. But for many visitors, the island's most memorable moments come from unexpected interactions with its unique terrestrial creatures.

One such encounter happened to tourism professional, Sarah Thompson, who recently visited the island. ""I was setting up my camera to capture a sunset shot when I felt a strange tug on my tripod,"" Thompson recounted. ""I turned around and there he was, a giant robber crab, holding my camera in his pincers.""

Robber crabs, also known as Birgus latro, are native to Christmas Island and are the largest land-dwelling crabs in the world. They can grow up to 3 feet wide and weigh as much as 9 kilograms. These crustaceans are notorious for their scavenging habits, often raiding turtle nests and stealing food from unsuspecting wildlife.

Thompson's experience is far from unique. Many visitors to Christmas Island have similar stories to share. ""I was hiking through the rainforest when I came across a group of robber crabs feasting on a dead bird,"" said Mark Williams, a wildlife photographer from Australia. ""They didn't seem to mind my presence at all. I managed to get some incredible shots before they scurried off.""

The island's wildlife officials caution tourists about the robber crabs, advising them to secure their belongings and be cautious when exploring the forests and beaches. ""Robber crabs are a vital part of Christmas Island's ecosystem, but they can also be quite aggressive,"" said Dr. Jane Brown, a biologist working on the island. ""We encourage tourists to respect these creatures and maintain a safe distance.""

While the encounters with the robber crabs can be intimidating, many visitors agree that they add to the island's unique charm. ""I've traveled to some amazing places, but nothing quite compares to Christmas Island,"" said Thompson. ""The robber crabs are just one of the many fascinating creatures that call this place home.""

For those planning a visit to Christmas Island, the island's tourism board offers a range of guided tours and wildlife spotting opportunities. Whether you're hoping to catch a glimpse of a red crab migration, swim with manta rays, or have a close encounter with a giant robber crab, Christmas Island promises an unforgettable adventure.

As for Thompson, she managed to retrieve her camera from the robber crab, albeit with a few scratches. ""It was a reminder that you never know what you might encounter when you visit Christmas Island,"" she said. ""But it's those unexpected moments that make the journey worthwhile.""",mistral
Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change,"Title: Olafur Eliasson on What Art Can Do to Fight Climate Change

In an exclusive interview, renowned Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson sheds light on the pivotal role art can play in the global fight against climate change. Eliasson, best known for his large-scale installations that explore perception, movement, and time, is using his art to create awareness and inspire action on one of the most pressing issues of our time.

""Art has the power to make people question, to provoke thought, and to create a sense of urgency,"" Eliasson explains. ""It can help us see the world in new ways, and, in doing so, inspire us to act.""

One of Eliasson's most notable works that addresses climate change is his 2003 installation, The Weather Project. Installed at the Tate Modern in London, the work featured an artificial sun suspended from the ceiling, casting a warm glow throughout the gallery. The installation aimed to create a sense of communal experience, encouraging visitors to reflect on the interconnectedness of human life and the natural world.

Eliasson's current project, Ice Watch, is a series of installations featuring blocks of ice carved from Greenlandic glaciers. The ice sculptures are displayed in various cities around the world, serving as a tangible reminder of the rapid melting of polar ice caps and the consequences of climate change.

""Ice Watch is not just about raising awareness,"" Eliasson says. ""It's about creating a sense of urgency, about making people realize that the changes we are seeing in our world are happening right now, and they are happening to us.""

Eliasson's approach to using art to address climate change is unique in that it focuses not only on raising awareness but also on inspiring action. He believes that art can play a crucial role in galvanizing communities and pushing governments to take action.

""Art can help us imagine a different future, a future in which we live in harmony with the natural world,"" Eliasson says. ""And if we can imagine that future, we can work towards creating it.""

Eliasson's work is just one example of how artists are using their craft to address climate change. From Yoko Ono's ""Wish Tree"" installations, which encourage visitors to make wishes for peace and environmental sustainability, to JR's large-scale photographs of endangered species, artists are using their unique perspectives to raise awareness and inspire action.

While art may not be able to solve the climate crisis on its own, Eliasson believes that it can play a significant role in shaping the narrative around climate change and inspiring individuals and communities to take action.

""Art has the power to change the way we see the world, and, in doing so, to change the way we act in it,"" Eliasson says. ""We need to harness that power, to use it to create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.""

As the impacts of climate change continue to be felt around the world, artists like Olafur Eliasson are using their art to raise awareness, inspire action, and create a sense of urgency. Through their work, they are helping to change the way we see the world and, in doing so, are helping to create a more sustainable future.",mistral
Opinion | ItÃ¢ÂÂs a MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"Title: ""Opinion | It's a MAGA Microbe Meltdown""

In a surprising turn of events, the once-mighty MAGA movement, known for its staunch advocacy of conservative values and populist politics, finds itself in a state of disarray, not due to political discord or policy disagreements, but as a result of a microscopic adversary: bacteria.

The MAGA Microbe Meltdown, as it has been dubbed, started with a seemingly innocuous tweet from a prominent MAGA supporter. The tweet, which was later revealed to have been sent from an iPhone, sparked a wave of concern among the movement's members. The tweet, it seems, was tainted with a particular strain of bacteria, known for its ability to thrive in digital environments.

The bacteria, identified as S. epidermidis, is commonly found on human skin. It is usually harmless, but under certain conditions, it can produce a toxin that is harmful to electronic devices. The bacteria, it appears, found a perfect breeding ground in the MAGA movement's digital ecosystem, leading to a rapid and unprecedented decline in the movement's online presence.

The first signs of the MAGA Microbe Meltdown were subtle. Posts started disappearing, accounts were suspended, and once-vibrant online communities began to dwindle. The MAGA movement, which had built its power on the strength of its digital footprint, found itself suddenly handicapped.

The MAGA Microbe Meltdown has had far-reaching implications. The loss of online presence has made it difficult for the movement to organize, communicate, and mobilize its supporters. The once-feared political force has been reduced to a shadow of its former self, struggling to regain its footing in the digital landscape.

The MAGA Microbe Meltdown is a stark reminder of the power of microbes, even in the digital world. It underscores the delicate balance between technology and biology, and the potential consequences of disrupting that balance.

The MAGA movement is not the only one to have experienced such a meltdown. In the past, similar instances have been reported in various online communities, highlighting the vulnerability of digital ecosystems to microbial invasions.

As the MAGA Microbe Meltdown continues to unfold, it is unclear how the movement will recover. Some experts predict a slow and painful rebuilding process, while others believe the movement may never fully regain its former strength.

In the meantime, the MAGA Microbe Meltdown serves as a warning to all online communities. It underscores the importance of maintaining a clean digital environment, and the potential consequences of neglecting that environment.

The MAGA Microbe Meltdown is a tale of technology and biology, power and vulnerability, and the fragility of digital ecosystems. It is a reminder that even in the digital age, the smallest of creatures can have the largest of impacts.

As the MAGA Microbe Meltdown continues to unfold, one thing is certain: the digital world is far from sterile, and the microscopic inhabitants of that world can have a profound impact on the human world above.",mistral
Bernie Sanders plans to stay in the 2020 presidential race,"**Title:** Bernie Sanders Plans to Stay in 2020 Presidential Race

**Subtitle:** Vermont Senator vows to continue fight for progressive policies as primary season heats up

In a surprising announcement made during a rally in Burlington, Vermont, Senator Bernie Sanders declared his intention to remain in the 2020 presidential race. The move comes after a string of losses in the Democratic primary, with the latest defeat coming in the Michigan primary on Tuesday.

Speaking before a crowd of thousands, Sanders expressed his determination to carry on the fight for his progressive platform, emphasizing the need for universal healthcare, tuition-free education, and combating income inequality.

""We are taking on the most powerful special interests in this country – the fossil fuel industry, the healthcare industry, and the financial industry,"" Sanders said. ""And we will win.""

Sanders' decision to stay in the race could potentially shake up the remaining primary contests, as Joe Biden, the former Vice President, has emerged as the frontrunner in the Democratic field. However, Sanders' campaign advisors have indicated that they see a path forward, citing strong results in states with high numbers of independents and younger voters.

The announcement was met with a mixed reaction from the Democratic establishment. Some party leaders have called for unity behind Biden, arguing that a prolonged primary could harm the party's chances in the general election. Others have praised Sanders for his unwavering commitment to progressive ideals and his ability to energize the base.

Sanders' campaign has faced criticism for its inability to expand its support beyond its core base. However, the senator has shown resilience in the face of these challenges, consistently drawing large crowds and raising significant funds.

The Vermont Senator's decision to stay in the race could also have implications for the Democratic Party's platform. Sanders' progressive policies have shifted the party's stance on key issues such as healthcare and income inequality, and his continued presence in the race could push the eventual nominee to adopt more progressive positions.

In a statement, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said, ""We are here to win, and we are just getting started."" The campaign plans to focus on upcoming primary contests in states like Florida, Illinois, and Arizona.

However, Sanders faces an uphill battle. Biden has won eight out of the last nine contests and currently holds a significant lead in delegates. Moreover, the Democratic National Committee has set a deadline for candidates to meet a threshold of 15% in three consecutive primaries to remain on the ballot. Sanders has failed to meet this threshold in the last two contests, raising questions about his viability moving forward.

Despite these challenges, Sanders' announcement has reignited the energy and enthusiasm that marked his 2016 campaign. As the primary season heats up, it remains to be seen whether Sanders can mount a comeback or if his campaign will fade away. One thing is certain: the 2020 presidential race is far from over.",mistral
Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus,"Title: **Why it Matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus**

In a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has yet to be tested for the novel coronavirus, despite multiple members of his administration and people in close contact testing positive. This lack of testing has raised concerns among health experts and the public alike, fueling speculation about the President's health and potential impact on the ongoing pandemic.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anyone who has been in close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19 should be tested, regardless of whether they are exhibiting symptoms. However, President Trump has so far declined to undergo testing, stating that he feels fine and citing the White House's protocols for testing.

The president's refusal to be tested has sparked a wave of criticism, with many arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the seriousness of the pandemic. By not being tested, Trump is sending a message that the virus is not a threat to him, despite evidence to the contrary.

The issue is not just about the President's health, but also about the potential spread of the virus within the White House and the broader community. If Trump has been exposed to the virus, but has not been tested, he could unknowingly be spreading it to others. This is particularly concerning given the President's frequent interactions with world leaders and large crowds.

Furthermore, by not being tested, Trump is creating an appearance of invulnerability, which could discourage others from taking the necessary precautions to protect themselves and others. This is a dangerous situation, as the pandemic continues to rage across the country, with over 600,000 confirmed cases and over 26,000 deaths as of this writing.

The White House has defended the President's decision not to be tested, stating that he is following the advice of his physicians and that he has not been in close contact with anyone who has tested positive for the virus. However, this argument has been met with skepticism, as the President's schedule shows numerous interactions with individuals who have since tested positive.

Health experts have also expressed concern about the potential political implications of the President's refusal to be tested. If Trump were to test positive, it could have significant implications for the upcoming election, potentially altering the course of the campaign and raising questions about the President's ability to effectively lead the country during a crisis.

In response to the criticism, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated that the President will be tested if he develops symptoms or if his doctors recommend it. However, this has done little to alleviate concerns, as the President's health is of paramount importance, and his continued refusal to be tested only adds to the uncertainty surrounding his status.

In conclusion, the fact that President Trump has not been tested for the coronavirus is a matter of great concern for health experts and the public. By refusing to be tested, the President is sending a dangerous message about the seriousness of the pandemic and potentially putting others at risk. It is crucial that the President sets an example by following the advice of health officials and being transparent about his health status. The nation is watching, and the President's actions have the potential to have a significant impact on the ongoing fight against the coronavirus.",mistral

**Choosing the Right Cooking Program**

The Instant Pot offers a variety of built-in programs to cook different dishes. These programs include Soup, Meat/Stew, Bean/Chili, Rice, Porridge, Steam, Sauté, Yogurt, Keep Warm, and Pressure Cook. Choose the program that best suits your recipe.

**Preparing Your Ingredients**

Prepare your ingredients according to your recipe. For best results, cut vegetables into uniform sizes to ensure even cooking. Brown meat in the Sauté function before pressure cooking for added flavor.

**Adding Liquid**

Most Instant Pot recipes require a liquid base, such as broth, water, or wine. The liquid helps create steam and maintain pressure inside the pot during cooking. A general rule is to use 1-2 cups of liquid for most dishes.

**Sealing the Instant Pot**

Once all ingredients are added, close the lid and make sure the steam release handle is in the sealing position. Turn the steam release handle to ""Sealing.""

Press the ""Manual"" or ""Pressure Cook"" button and use the +/- buttons to adjust the cooking time. The Instant Pot will take a few minutes to build pressure before it starts counting down the cooking time.

**Releasing Pressure**

After cooking, let the Instant Pot release pressure naturally for 10-15 minutes before switching the steam release handle to ""Venting"" to release any remaining pressure. Be careful as hot steam will escape.

**Serving Your Meal**

Once all pressure is released, open the lid and carefully remove the inner pot. Use oven mitts or pot holders to handle the pot. Serve your meal and enjoy!

**Cleaning Your Instant Pot**

Cleaning the Instant Pot is easy. Remove the inner pot and wash it with warm, soapy water. Wipe the exterior of the Instant Pot with a damp cloth.

**Tips and Tricks**

- Use the Sauté function to brown meats, sauté vegetables, or reduce sauces.
- Add a tablespoon of oil to the inner pot before sautéing to prevent sticking.
- For multiple layers of rice, cook each layer separately.
- Use the Yogurt function to make homemade yogurt.
- If your Instant Pot overpressurizes, it may cause a burn notice. Allow the pot to cool down before opening and cleaning.

With these tips and steps, you're now ready to use your Instant Pot to prepare delicious, home-cooked meals with ease and convenience. Happy cooking!",mistral
Delhi riots: 'No-one who saw the photo thought I would survive',"**Delhi Riots: 'No-One Who Saw the Photo Thought I Would Survive'**

In the chaotic aftermath of the Delhi riots, one photograph has come to symbolize the brutal violence that erupted in the Indian capital. The image, capturing a young man named Saqib, lying motionless on a street, has become a stark reminder of the human toll of the unrest.

Saqib, a 23-year-old resident of Northeast Delhi's Chand Bagh area, was on his way home from work on February 24 when he was caught in the crossfire between Hindu and Muslim mobs. He was shot in the chest and left for dead.

""No one who saw the photo thought I would survive,"" Saqib said from his hospital bed, his voice barely a whisper. ""I didn't think I would either.""

The photo, taken by a local photographer, shows Saqib lying on the ground, his shirt soaked in blood, his face expressionless. It was shared widely on social media, sparking outrage and calls for justice.

Saqib's family found him on the street, and he was rushed to a hospital. Doctors said he had suffered a bullet wound to his chest and that he was lucky to be alive.

""When I saw him, I couldn't believe it was my son,"" Saqib's father, a rickshaw puller, said, his voice choked with emotion. ""I thought he was dead.""

The Delhi riots, which took place from February 24 to February 26, left at least 53 people dead and hundreds injured. The violence was triggered by a citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims and has led to widespread protests across India.

Saqib's family said they had been living in fear for weeks before the riots. They had received threats and had to flee their home.

""We thought we were safe here,"" Saqib's mother said. ""But then the mobs came, and everything changed.""

Saqib's family is not alone. Thousands of Muslims in Northeast Delhi have been displaced by the violence, and many are living in makeshift shelters.

The Indian government has been widely criticized for its handling of the riots. Critics say that the police did not do enough to prevent the violence and that they stood by while mobs attacked Muslim neighborhoods.

Saqib's family is calling for a thorough investigation into the riots and for those responsible to be held accountable.

""I want justice,"" Saqib said. ""I want those who did this to me to be punished.""

Saqib's recovery is slow, but he is determined to rebuild his life. He hopes to return to work as a tailor and to one day marry and start a family.

""I'm lucky to be alive,"" Saqib said. ""But I won't let this define me. I will keep fighting.""

As India grapples with the aftermath of the Delhi riots, Saqib's story serves as a reminder of the need for peace and justice. His survival is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and his determination to rebuild his life is an inspiration to all.",mistral
What this will cost Mitch McConnell,"Title: What This Will Cost Mitch McConnell

In the turbulent landscape of American politics, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell finds himself in a precarious position following the 2022 midterm elections. As the Republican Party grapples with its post-election fallout, McConnell's political future and legacy are under scrutiny.

McConnell's tenure as Senate leader has been marked by significant achievements, such as the confirmation of three Supreme Court Justices and numerous conservative judicial appointments. However, his hardline approach has also led to a deepening rift within the Republican Party, setting the stage for potential fallout.

The 2022 midterms saw a significant shift in the political landscape, with Democrats defying historical trends to retain control of the Senate. Despite expectations of a ""red wave,"" Republicans failed to secure the necessary seats to take control, dealing a blow to McConnell's ambitions.

This outcome has sparked criticism from within the party, with some Republicans accusing McConnell of a lackluster campaign strategy and insufficient support for GOP candidates. In particular, McConnell's refusal to support former President Donald Trump's endorsed candidates in several key races has drawn ire from Trump's base.

The backlash against McConnell is not limited to the Republicans. Demonstrations outside his Kentucky home have become a regular occurrence, with protesters calling for his resignation. The intensity of these protests is unusual for a Senate leader, underscoring the public dissatisfaction with McConnell's leadership.

McConnell's future in the Senate remains uncertain. Some speculate that he may choose to retire, allowing a more moderate Republican to take his place. Others believe he will seek reelection in 2026, hoping to rebuild his political capital and restore his influence.

Regardless of his decision, the 2022 midterm elections have exacted a heavy toll on McConnell's political standing. His hardline approach and refusal to align with Trump's base have alienated many within his party, potentially weakening his ability to exert influence in the Senate.

Moreover, the shifting political landscape may present new challenges for McConnell. With President Biden and a Democratic-controlled Congress, the next few years are likely to be marked by partisan gridlock. McConnell's ability to navigate this environment and advocate for Republican priorities will be crucial to his political future.

In conclusion, the 2022 midterm elections have left Mitch McConnell's political future in doubt. His hardline approach and refusal to align with Trump's base have led to a deepening rift within the Republican Party, potentially weakening his influence in the Senate. As McConnell considers his next steps, he faces a difficult road ahead in rebuilding his political capital and restoring his legacy.",mistral
Senate Democrats call for more sanctions against 'Putin's chef' following CNN investigation,"Title: Senate Democrats Call for More Sanctions Against 'Putin's Chef' Following CNN Investigation

Washington D.C., [Current Date] — A group of Senate Democrats is urging the Biden administration to impose additional sanctions on Russian oligarch Gennady Timchenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a CNN investigation that alleges Timchenko's company has been involved in illicit activities.

In a letter to the White House, ten Senate Democrats, led by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), expressed concern over Timchenko's continued business dealings in the United States and his alleged ties to the Russian government. The senators called on the administration to take immediate action to sanction Timchenko and his companies, in line with the foreign policy objectives of the United States.

""The evidence uncovered by CNN's investigation raises serious questions about the extent of Timchenko's complicity in illicit activities and his close ties to the Russian government,"" the senators wrote in the letter. ""It is imperative that the United States take action to hold accountable those who undermine our democratic values and engage in corruption.""

The CNN investigation, which aired on Sunday, alleged that Timchenko's company, Volga Group, has been involved in money laundering, tax evasion, and other illegal activities. The report claimed that Timchenko has used shell companies and offshore accounts to conceal the true ownership of his assets and to evade American sanctions.

Timchenko's ties to Putin are well-documented. He was first sanctioned by the United States in 2014, along with other Russian oligarchs, in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. The Obama administration accused Timchenko of being a close associate of Putin and a key figure in the Russian economy.

Since then, Timchenko has been able to maintain a low profile in the United States, where he owns several multi-million-dollar properties. He has also continued to do business with American companies, despite the sanctions.

The Senate Democrats' letter comes as the Biden administration is reportedly considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to a series of cyberattacks and other acts of aggression. The administration has said it is reviewing its options, but has not yet announced any specific actions.

The senators urged the administration to take a tough stance against Russia and to send a clear message that the United States will not tolerate corruption and illicit activities by Russian oligarchs.

""The United States must take a leadership role in the global effort to combat corruption and to hold accountable those who undermine democratic values and engage in illicit activities,"" the senators wrote. ""We urge the administration to consider the evidence uncovered by CNN's investigation and to take immediate action to sanction Gennady Timchenko and his companies.""

The letter was also signed by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).

A spokesperson for the White House declined to comment on the letter, but said that the administration is reviewing its options for responding to Russia's actions.

The Senate Democrats' call for additional sanctions against Timchenko is the latest in a series of bipartisan efforts to hold Russia accountable for its actions. In recent months, both the House and Senate have passed legislation aimed at targeting Russian oligarchs and their assets in the United States.

The legislation, which is still pending, would give the U.S. government new tools to sanction oligarchs and to seize their assets in the United States. It would also require the Treasury Department to publish a list of Russian oligarchs and their assets, providing the public with greater transparency into the activities of these wealthy individuals.

The Senate Democrats' letter is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges posed by Russian oligarchs and their ties to the Russian government. As the United States and its allies work to counter Russian aggression, the issue of corruption and the role of oligarchs in perpetuating it",mistral

How virtual reality is changing the live music experience,"Title: How Virtual Reality is Changing the Live Music Experience

In the dynamic world of entertainment, few sectors are as captivating and exhilarating as live music. However, the advent of virtual reality (VR) technology is poised to revolutionize this realm, offering a unique blend of immersive experiences and global accessibility.

The live music industry has long been a cornerstone of cultural expression and community gathering. Yet, geographical limitations and financial barriers often prevented fans from experiencing their favorite artists in person. VR technology is set to erase these barriers, providing an opportunity for music enthusiasts worldwide to attend concerts virtually, regardless of their location.

One of the most significant advancements in this area is the development of VR concert platforms. Companies such as MelodyVR and Next VR are pioneering the creation of virtual concert venues, allowing fans to don VR headsets and immerse themselves in live performances. These platforms offer users a 360-degree view of the concert, placing them right in the heart of the action.

Moreover, VR technology is not just limited to watching concerts. It also opens up opportunities for interactive experiences. Artists can now engage with their audience in unprecedented ways, creating immersive experiences that blend music, art, and technology. For instance, Björk's virtual reality project, ""Björk Digital,"" allowed fans to explore a 3D world inspired by her music, providing an entirely new way to experience her art.

The benefits of VR technology extend beyond the concert-goer. Artists and music producers also stand to gain from this innovation. Virtual reality concerts offer a new revenue stream, allowing artists to reach a global audience without the expense and logistical challenges of touring. Furthermore, VR technology can provide valuable data on audience engagement, helping artists tailor their performances and connect with fans on a deeper level.

However, the integration of VR technology into the live music experience is not without its challenges. One of the main concerns is the potential for a disconnected audience. While VR technology offers a unique level of immersion, it also risks isolating users from the communal aspect of live music. The shared energy and camaraderie that comes with attending a concert in person may be lost in a virtual setting.

Another concern is the accessibility of VR technology. While the cost of VR headsets has decreased in recent years, they still remain a luxury item for many. Moreover, the technology requires a powerful computer or console to run smoothly, further limiting its accessibility.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of VR technology in the live music industry are undeniable. It offers the promise of a more inclusive, immersive, and interactive live music experience. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see it play an increasingly significant role in the future of live music.

In conclusion, virtual reality is set to transform the live music landscape. By offering immersive, interactive, and globally accessible experiences, VR technology is poised to revolutionize the way we attend and enjoy live music. While challenges remain, the potential benefits are undeniable, and we can expect to see VR technology play an increasingly significant role in the future of live music.",mistral
"Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up","Title: Putin and Xi Extend Control Amid Crisis as Trump Struggles to Keep Up

In the face of the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic, world leaders are being tested on their ability to navigate the crisis while maintaining their grip on power. Two leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, are leveraging the crisis to further consolidate their control, while U.S. President Donald Trump faces mounting challenges to his leadership.

Putin, already a strongman who has tightened his grip on power over the past two decades, has exploited the crisis to further consolidate his hold on Russia. Last week, he secured the passage of constitutional amendments that could potentially allow him to stay in power until 2036. The changes, which were approved by a landslide vote in a hasty referendum, also enshrine Putin's ideology as the foundation of Russia's statehood.

In China, Xi has used the crisis to bolster his image as a decisive and effective leader. He has been visible in public, visiting hospitals and factories, and has taken a firm hand in managing the crisis. Xi has also used the pandemic to crack down on dissent, with reports of increased surveillance and censorship, as well as a clampdown on protests over the government's handling of the outbreak.

In contrast, Trump's response to the pandemic has been erratic and divisive. He has flip-flopped on the severity of the crisis, downplaying it one moment, then sounding the alarm the next. His handling of the crisis has been marred by political infighting, with the president attacking critics and political rivals, and refusing to accept responsibility for the government's slow response to the outbreak.

Trump's handling of the pandemic has also been marked by a lack of decisive action. Despite warnings from public health experts, the president has resisted calls for a nationwide lockdown, instead leaving the decision to individual states. This has led to a patchwork of responses across the country, with some states taking aggressive action to contain the virus, while others have been slow to act.

Trump's political rivals have seized on the crisis to attack his leadership. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has accused Trump of bungling the response to the pandemic and putting politics ahead of public health. Biden has called for a national strategy to combat the virus, and has criticized the president for his lack of leadership and his refusal to wear a mask in public.

The coronavirus pandemic has exposed weaknesses in all three leaders' responses to the crisis, but Putin and Xi have been more effective in using the crisis to consolidate their power. Putin's constitutional changes, which were passed with near unanimous support in a hasty referendum, have given him the ability to stay in power for potentially two more terms. Xi, meanwhile, has used the pandemic to crack down on dissent and bolster his image as a decisive leader.

Trump, on the other hand, has struggled to keep up. His erratic and divisive response to the crisis has undermined his leadership, and his refusal to wear a mask has made him a lightning rod for criticism. The president's political rivals have seized on the crisis to attack his leadership, and his response has been marked by a lack of decisive action.

As the pandemic continues to spread across the world, the leaders of Russia, China, and the United States will be tested like never before. Putin and Xi have already shown that they are willing to use the crisis to consolidate their power, while Trump faces mounting challenges to his leadership. The outcome of the pandemic will determine not just the fate of the world, but also the future of these three leaders.",mistral
How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus,"Title: How to Clean Your Phone to Help Protect Against Coronavirus

As the global fight against COVID-19 continues, maintaining hygiene and cleanliness has become more important than ever. One often-overlooked item in our daily lives is our smartphone, which we touch frequently and carry everywhere. Here's a simple guide on how to clean your phone effectively to help protect against coronavirus.

1. Use Alcohol Wipes or Sprays

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol to disinfect your phone. Alcohol wipes are readily available at most stores, or you can make your own by soaking a microfiber cloth in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 30 seconds.

2. Avoid Moisture and Harsh Chemicals

While alcohol is effective, avoid using bleach or other harsh chemicals as they can damage your phone's screen and other components. Also, avoid getting moisture into any openings, as this can lead to internal damage.

3. Clean Your Case and Accessories

Don't forget to clean your phone case and any accessories like headphones or chargers. These items can harbor germs as well, and regular cleaning can help reduce the risk.

4. Use Disposable Wipes or Cloths

To prevent recontamination, use a new wipe or cloth for each section of your phone. This ensures that you're not transferring germs from one area to another.

5. Turn Off Your Phone Before Cleaning

It's a good idea to turn off your phone before cleaning to prevent any accidental activation of buttons. This also helps ensure that the alcohol solution doesn't get inside the device.

6. Be Gentle

When cleaning your phone, be gentle to avoid scratching the screen. Use a soft, lint-free cloth if you don't have alcohol wipes.

7. Clean Regularly

Ideally, you should clean your phone daily, especially if you're using it in public places or if you've been in contact with someone who is sick.

In addition to cleaning your phone, practicing good hygiene is essential. Wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, and maintain a safe distance from others.

While cleaning your phone won't guarantee protection against coronavirus, it's a simple step that can help reduce the risk of transmission. By following these guidelines, you can help keep yourself and others safe.",mistral
Coronavirus shows up Trump's compassion deficit,"Title: ""Coronavirus Shows Up Trump's Compassion Deficit""

In the face of a global pandemic that has claimed over 240,000 lives and infected millions, President Donald Trump's response has been marked by a noticeable lack of empathy, underscoring a longstanding criticism of his administration's compassion deficit.

As the coronavirus swept across the United States, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, the president's public remarks have been marred by a series of tone-deaf comments and actions. In a notable instance, Trump tweeted a photo of himself at his golf resort in Virginia, captioned, ""Great day at the White House CoronaVirus Task Force, and yesterday, a very good round of golf!"" The tweet sparked widespread criticism for its insensitivity at a time when the virus was claiming thousands of lives each day.

Moreover, the president's handling of the crisis has been characterized by a lack of empathy towards those affected by the virus. During a press conference, when asked about the rising number of deaths, Trump responded, ""It is what it is,"" a comment that was widely viewed as callous and uncaring. Similarly, when asked about the economic toll of the pandemic, the president said, ""People are dying, that's true. And more are going to die, unfortunately. But we're going to lose fewer people than we would have lost had we not done anything.""

Trump's response to the crisis has also been criticized for its lack of coordination and planning. Critics argue that the president's focus on reopening the economy, even as the virus continues to spread, shows a lack of concern for public health and safety. In contrast, many governors have taken a more measured approach, prioritizing the health of their constituents while also working to revive their economies.

The president's approach to the crisis has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. The White House has been slow to release data on the number of tests being conducted, the number of cases, and the number of deaths. This lack of transparency has fueled speculation about the true extent of the crisis and the effectiveness of the administration's response.

Furthermore, the president's response to the crisis has been marked by a lack of empathy towards those most affected by the pandemic. The administration's initial response was slow and disorganized, leading to a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. As a result, many healthcare workers have been forced to reuse masks and other PPE, putting themselves at risk of infection.

The president's response to the crisis has also been criticized for its lack of support for those who have lost their jobs or are struggling to make ends meet. While the government has provided some financial aid to individuals and businesses, many have criticized the administration for not doing enough. Moreover, the president has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the crisis, even as unemployment rates soar and food banks struggle to meet demand.

In contrast, many Democratic leaders have shown a marked contrast in their response to the crisis. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been praised for his empathetic and compassionate leadership during the pandemic, offering daily briefings that provide clear and concise information about the virus and the state's response. Similarly, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has been praised for her leadership in negotiating a relief package for those affected by the crisis.

In conclusion, the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted a longstanding criticism of the Trump administration's lack of compassion. The president's tone-deaf comments, lack of transparency, and failure to prioritize public health have been contrasted with the empathetic and compassionate leadership shown by many Democratic leaders. As the pandemic continues to ravage the country, it remains to be seen whether the president will learn from his mistakes and show more empathy and compassion in his response to the crisis.",mistral

Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary,"**White Giraffes Slain by Poachers at Kenyan Wildlife Sanctuary**

In a devastating blow to conservation efforts, the rare white giraffes residing at Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy in Garissa County, Kenya, have been brutally killed by poachers. The loss of these unique creatures has left the local community and wildlife enthusiasts worldwide in mourning.

The white giraffes, Umbrella and Owen, were discovered in 2017 and were believed to be the only ones of their kind in the world. Their striking coats, resulting from a genetic disorder known as leucism, made them an international sensation. They captivated the hearts of many, including researchers and conservationists, who hoped their presence would inspire efforts to protect their habitat and species.

According to a statement released by the conservancy, the poachers targeted the white giraffes due to the misconception that their unique coloration made their bones more valuable. The poachers are said to have used a high-powered rifle to kill the giraffes, leaving behind a scene of carnage.

The Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, a non-profit organization that manages the protected area, is working closely with the Kenyan Wildlife Service (KWS) to investigate the poaching incident. The conservancy's director, Boniface Lele, expressed his deep sorrow and vowed to bring those responsible to justice.

""The loss of Umbrella and Owen is a devastating blow to us all,"" Lele said. ""These magnificent creatures were not just a source of pride for our community, but they were also powerful symbols of conservation and hope. We are committed to finding the perpetrators and ensuring they face the full force of the law.""

The killings of Umbrella and Owen serve as a grim reminder of the ongoing threats faced by wildlife in Kenya. Poaching remains a significant issue, despite efforts by the government and conservation organizations to combat it. The loss of these rare white giraffes underscores the urgent need for continued action to protect endangered species and their habitats.

The global conservation community has expressed its condolences and support for the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy. Organizations such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF) have pledged their assistance in the investigation and the ongoing efforts to protect the remaining giraffe populations in Kenya.

""The white giraffes were not just a unique attraction, but they were also an important part of the ecosystem,"" said Azzedine Downes, IFAW's president and CEO. ""Their loss is a tragedy, but we will not let it discourage us. We will continue to work with our partners in Kenya to protect wildlife and ensure that future generations can marvel at the beauty of these magnificent creatures.""

As the investigation into the poaching of Umbrella and Owen continues, the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy and its partners will redouble their efforts to protect the remaining giraffe populations in the region. They hope that the tragic loss of these unique creatures will serve as a rallying cry for greater action to combat wildlife crime and secure a future for the world's most endangered species.",mistral
Flu leaves a 4-year-old girl blind in Iowa,"Title: Flu Leaves 4-Year-Old Girl Blind in Iowa

Iowa City, IA - A heart-wrenching tale of a 4-year-old girl has swept through the community of Iowa City, where she resides with her family. The toddler, identified as Emily Johnson, is now blind after a severe case of the flu left her critically ill.

Emily, a vibrant and active child known for her infectious laughter, was admitted to University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital in mid-January. Her parents, who declined to comment for this article, reported that she had been experiencing flu-like symptoms for several days prior.

Dr. Robert Thompson, Emily's pediatrician, confirmed the initial diagnosis, stating, ""Emily came in with a high fever, severe cough, and difficulty breathing. We immediately started her on antiviral medication, but her condition rapidly deteriorated.""

The flu, a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, can be particularly dangerous for young children and those with weakened immune systems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), complications from the flu can result in hospitalization or even death, underscoring the importance of vaccination, especially during the current flu season.

Emily's case, however, took a tragic turn. ""Despite our best efforts, Emily developed acute encephalopathy, a condition that can cause brain damage and lead to long-term complications, including vision loss,"" said Dr. Thompson.

Emily's family has since launched a GoFundMe campaign to help cover the mounting medical expenses, with a goal of $100,000. The campaign has already raised over $60,000, with donations pouring in from across the country.

The community has also rallied around the family, organizing a series of fundraisers, including a local bake sale and a benefit concert. A neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, said, ""Emily is such a sweet girl, and it's heartbreaking to see her and her family go through this. We just want to help in any way we can.""

Emily's story serves as a stark reminder of the potentially devastating effects of the flu. While the vaccine is not 100% effective, it significantly reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The CDC recommends annual vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, with a particular emphasis on high-risk groups such as young children, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions.

As Emily continues her recovery, her family and community remain hopeful for her future. ""Emily is a fighter, and we believe she will overcome this challenge,"" said a close friend of the family. ""We're just taking it one day at a time and praying for a miracle.""

In the meantime, the community continues to support the Johnsons, offering both financial assistance and emotional support during this difficult time. For more information about Emily's condition or to make a donation, visit her GoFundMe page.

This story serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of vaccination and the potential consequences of not doing so. As the flu season continues, it's crucial to prioritize health and safety, not only for ourselves but for those around us, especially vulnerable members of our community.",mistral
The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"Title: The Soft Power Impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Decorative Collars

In the world of politics, the power of a statement can often lie not in the words spoken, but in the symbols that are worn. One such symbol, emblematic of both personal style and cultural symbolism, has become a significant part of the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: her decorative collars.

Known colloquially as ""jabot"" collars, these eye-catching accessories have adorned Ginsburg's neck since her appointment to the Court in 1993. They have become more than just a fashion statement; they have evolved into a potent tool of soft power, a term used to describe the ability to attract and co-opt people to a nation's values, ideas, and policies through appeal and attraction rather than coercion.

The origins of Ginsburg's jabot collars can be traced back to her late husband, Martin Ginsburg. As a gift for her graduation from Columbia Law School in 1959, he presented her with a jabot collar. The gift was both pragmatic and symbolic, designed to hide the collar of her graduation robe and serve as a reminder of their shared history. Over the years, this initial gift has grown into a collection of over 100 collars, each with its unique design and story.

Ginsburg's collars have captured the public's imagination, becoming a symbol of her fierce intellect, resilience, and unwavering commitment to justice. They have transcended the realm of fashion, taking on a life of their own as a symbol of femininity, power, and resistance.

The collars have also served as a means of quiet protest. Ginsburg, known for her dissents in high-profile cases, has used her collars to make subtle statements. For instance, during the oral arguments for the 2013 case Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Ginsburg wore a collar designed by artist and activist Sue Phelps. The collar featured the words ""We the People"" in multiple languages, symbolizing Ginsburg's belief in the importance of equal representation for all.

In an increasingly polarized political climate, Ginsburg's collars have served as a beacon of hope and inspiration. They have become a symbol of resistance, a reminder that even in the face of adversity, one can maintain their dignity and hold fast to their values.

But the impact of Ginsburg's collars extends beyond the United States. They have become a symbol of feminism and justice on a global scale. In interviews, Ginsburg has spoken about the importance of international cooperation and the need for a global community that values equality and justice. Her collars, in their unique and colorful designs, have served as a visual embodiment of these ideals, resonating with people worldwide.

In a world where political leaders often seem distant and unapproachable, Ginsburg's collars offer a different perspective. They serve as a reminder that even the most powerful figures can be human, with personal histories and symbols that resonate on a deeply personal level.

As Ginsburg's health declined in her final years, her collars took on an even greater significance. They became a symbol of her resilience, her determination, and her unwavering commitment to justice. Even in the face of her own mortality, Ginsburg continued to use her collars as a means of making a statement, wearing them until her final days on the bench.

In the years since her passing, Ginsburg's collars have continued to be a source of inspiration. They serve as a reminder of a legacy that transcends the political realm, inspiring people to stand up for their beliefs, to resist injustice, and to strive for a world that values equality and justice for all.

In the end, Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars are more than just accessories. They are a testament to a life lived with purpose, a symbol of a fierce intellect, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, hope can be found in the most unexpected of places. As we move forward, let us remember Ginsburg's collars not",mistral
Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure,"Title: Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure

In a world where consumers increasingly demand ethical products, the chocolate industry is under the spotlight for its long-standing ties to child labor and forced labor. However, a growing number of companies are taking steps to ensure their chocolate supply chains are slave-free, offering consumers a chance to indulge in a sweet treat without the guilt.

One such company is Tony's Chocolonely, a Dutch chocolate maker that prides itself on its transparent and ethical sourcing practices. Founded in 2005, the company aims to combat child labor and modern slavery in the cocoa industry by working directly with farmers and cooperatives to ensure fair wages and safe working conditions.

""Our mission is to make 100% slave-free the norm in chocolate,"" said Teun van de Keuken, co-founder of Tony's Chocolonely. ""We believe that everyone deserves a living income, and we're determined to make that a reality for cocoa farmers and their families.""

Tony's Chocolonely sources its cocoa beans from West Africa, where the majority of the world's cocoa is grown. The company works with Fairtrade certified cooperatives, which ensures that farmers receive a fair price for their cocoa and have access to social and environmental programs.

In addition to its commitment to fair trade, Tony's Chocolonely also conducts regular audits of its supply chain to ensure that there is no evidence of child labor or forced labor. The company has also established a hotline for workers to report any concerns or issues, and provides training to farmers on how to identify and address child labor.

Other companies are following suit. Hershey's, the largest chocolate maker in the U.S., has pledged to eliminate child labor from its supply chain by 2022. The company has implemented a number of measures to achieve this goal, including partnering with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and investing in community development programs in cocoa-growing regions.

""We believe that every person deserves the opportunity to work in safe, fair and equitable conditions,"" said Michele Buck, CEO of Hershey's. ""We're committed to making a positive impact in the communities where our cocoa is sourced, and we're working closely with our partners to achieve this goal.""

While progress is being made, the fight against child labor and forced labor in the chocolate industry is far from over. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), an estimated 2.1 million children are engaged in hazardous work in the cocoa sector, and many are exposed to forced labor, physical abuse, and harmful chemicals.

Advocacy groups are calling on consumers to use their purchasing power to demand change. ""Consumers have the power to make a difference by choosing chocolate that is certified as slave-free,"" said Kaitlyn Henderson, campaign director at the anti-slavery organization Free the Slaves. ""By supporting companies that are committed to ethical sourcing, we can help to end the exploitation of cocoa farmers and their families.""

As the chocolate industry faces increasing scrutiny and pressure to address child labor and forced labor, it remains to be seen whether companies will continue to make progress towards a slave-free supply chain. But for consumers who want to enjoy their chocolate without the guilt, companies like Tony's Chocolonely offer a sweet alternative.

""We believe that chocolate can be a force for good,"" said van de Keuken. ""By choosing slave-free chocolate, consumers can help to create a world where cocoa farmers are paid a living wage, and where children are free from exploitation.""

In a world where ethical consumption is becoming more and more important, the chocolate industry is taking steps to ensure that consumers can indulge in a sweet treat without the guilt. As more companies commit to slave-free chocolate, the future looks brighter for cocoa farmers and their families, and for consumers who want to make a difference with their purchasing power.",mistral

Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks,"**Major Sports Leagues in the US Suspend Play or Bar Fans Amid Coronavirus Outbreaks**

In a historic move to combat the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, several major sports leagues in the United States have decided to either halt play or exclude fans from games. The decisions, made in consultation with health authorities, aim to mitigate the spread of the virus and prioritize public safety.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) was the first to announce that it would suspend its season indefinitely, following the diagnosis of Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert with COVID-19. The announcement came just hours before the Jazz was set to face off against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday night.

The National Hockey League (NHL), Major League Soccer (MLS), and Major League Baseball (MLB) have also taken steps to address the situation. The NHL has suspended its season, while the MLS has postponed its matches for 30 days. MLB, which had already delayed the start of its spring training, has canceled domestic and international games until further notice.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has also taken action, canceling all remaining winter and spring championships, including the Division I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments, commonly known as March Madness.

The decision to exclude fans from games has been made by leagues such as the NBA and the NHL. In a statement, the NBA said, ""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic."" The NHL, in a similar statement, said it was ""working with public health officials, medical experts, and team physicians to determine the next steps.""

The moves come as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. continues to rise, with over 1,600 cases and 41 deaths as of Wednesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The decisions have been met with a mix of reactions from players, fans, and industry experts. While many have expressed understanding and support for the measures, others have raised concerns about the financial implications for teams, players, and staff, as well as the potential impact on the broader sports industry.

The NFL, which has a later start to its season, has not yet made a decision regarding its upcoming games. However, the league has issued a statement saying it is ""working closely with medical experts to assess potential impacts caused by COVID-19.""

The developments mark a significant shift in the sports world, with many events and competitions being postponed or canceled around the globe. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has also expressed concern about the ongoing situation, saying it is ""closely monitoring the evolution of the worldwide situation and its impact"" on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how long these measures will be in place and what the long-term effects will be on the sports industry in the U.S. and beyond. In the meantime, public health remains the top priority, with sports leagues and organizations working to do their part in slowing the spread of the coronavirus.",mistral
10 commandments for better sleep on World Sleep Day,"**Title:** 10 Commandments for Better Sleep on World Sleep Day

1. **Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle helps regulate your body’s internal clock and could improve the quality of your sleep.

2. **Create a Restful Environment:** A cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable room can promote better sleep. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary.

3. **Limit Exposure to Screens Before Bed:** The blue light emitted by phones, tablets, computers, and TVs can suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep.

4. **Exercise Regularly:** Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. However, try to finish your workout at least three hours before bedtime to allow your body to cool down.

5. **Watch Your Diet:** Aim to eat a balanced diet and avoid heavy meals close to bedtime. Also, limit caffeine and alcohol consumption, especially in the evening.

6. **Manage Stress Levels:** Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, reading, or listening to calming music can help reduce stress and promote better sleep.

7. **Limit Naps:** Short power naps of 20-30 minutes can help increase alertness and productivity, but longer or irregular napping can disrupt your nighttime sleep.

8. **Use Your Bed for Sleep and Sex Only:** Training your body to associate the bed with sleep can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy better quality sleep.

9. **Stay Hydrated, But Avoid Liquids Before Bed:** While it’s important to stay hydrated, drinking large amounts of fluid close to bedtime could lead to frequent bathroom trips during the night.

10. **Consult a Professional if Needed:** If you consistently have trouble sleeping, consider seeking help from a healthcare provider. They can help identify any underlying issues and provide appropriate treatment.

This World Sleep Day, commit to these 10 commandments for better sleep. A good night's rest is essential for both physical and mental health. Remember, quality sleep can lead to improved mood, increased productivity, and a healthier lifestyle. Sweet dreams!",mistral

The tragic details of the killing of Amie Harwick,"Title: ""The Tragic Details of the Killing of Amie Harwick""

Los Angeles, CA - A shocking and heartbreaking incident has left the entertainment industry and the public in mourning. On Saturday, February 15, renowned family therapist Amie Harwick was killed in her home in Los Angeles's Hollywood Hills. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has since arrested and charged her ex-boyfriend, Gareth Pursehouse, with her murder.

Harwick, 38, was a well-respected therapist who had appeared on several high-profile talk shows, including Dr. Phil, to discuss topics like divorce, dating, and domestic violence. She was also a dedicated advocate for victims of domestic abuse.

According to the LAPD, Pursehouse, 41, allegedly threw Harwick from a third-story balcony of her home after a domestic dispute. Harwick was pronounced dead at the scene. Neighbors reported hearing loud noises coming from Harwick's home late on Saturday night.

Pursehouse was taken into custody on Sunday, February 16, after a brief standoff with the police. He was charged with one count of murder and one count of first-degree residential burglary.

Harwick and Pursehouse reportedly dated for two years before breaking up in 2018. In court documents, Harwick alleged that Pursehouse had physically abused her during their relationship. She had obtained a restraining order against him in 2019, which was extended until 2020.

Harwick's friends and colleagues have expressed their shock and grief at her death. Dr. Phil McGraw, who had featured Harwick on his show multiple times, said in a statement, ""Amie was a brilliant and dynamic therapist, an advocate for women, and a loved and dedicated member of my team. She was smart, she was funny, she was a incredible wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend.""

Harwick's death has sparked renewed conversations about domestic violence and the importance of seeking help. The Los Angeles Domestic Violence Hotline saw a spike in calls in the days following her death, with many people seeking information and support.

The LAPD is continuing to investigate Harwick's murder, and Pursehouse is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday, February 18. The case has been assigned to the department's Robbery-Homicide Division.

Harwick's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of her funeral and to support her young daughter. Donations can be made at <https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-amies-family-during-this-difficult-time>.

The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"Title: The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders

In the quiet town of Meadowgrove, a perplexing enigma has emerged, leaving residents in a state of bewilderment. Over the past month, several bus commuters have inexplicably vanished without a trace while traveling on their usual routes. The local authorities, along with the transportation department, are scrambling to solve this enigma, as the number of missing individuals continues to climb.

The incident first came to light when 47-year-old Jane Thompson, a regular bus commuter, failed to show up at her workplace. Her colleagues reported her absence to the police, who soon learned that she was last seen boarding the 7:30 AM bus from Meadowgrove's Central Terminal. The bus driver, Robert Price, confirmed seeing Jane board the bus but was puzzled when she did not disembark at her usual stop.

Since Jane's disappearance, four more individuals have vanished under similar circumstances. All five victims were regular bus commuters who had no known ties to criminal organizations or any personal issues that could potentially explain their sudden disappearance.

The Meadowgrove Police Department, led by Chief John Matthews, has launched a thorough investigation, interviewing witnesses, examining CCTV footage, and questioning bus drivers. However, no concrete leads have emerged thus far.

""It's an unusual case, indeed,"" Chief Matthews said in a press conference. ""We are leaving no stone unturned in our quest to solve this mystery. We understand the concern and apprehension of our citizens, and we assure you that we are doing everything in our power to find those who have gone missing.""

The transportation department, in collaboration with the police, has increased security measures on buses, including installing additional CCTV cameras and conducting regular inspections. They have also offered a reward for any information leading to the whereabouts of the missing individuals.

Meanwhile, the town's residents are on edge, with many choosing to carpool or walk to work instead of taking the bus. The once bustling Central Terminal now echoes with an eerie silence, as commuters hesitate to board the buses.

Local psychologist Dr. Emily Parker believes that the fear and uncertainty surrounding the case are taking a toll on Meadowgrove's residents. ""Human beings are social creatures, and the sudden disappearance of several individuals from our community has understandably created a sense of unease,"" she said. ""It's crucial that we, as a community, support each other during this challenging time and remain vigilant in providing any information that could aid the investigation.""

As the search for the missing bus riders continues, the people of Meadowgrove hold onto hope that their loved ones will be found safe and sound. In the meantime, the town unites in resilience, reminding each other that the strength of a community lies in its ability to support one another during trying times.

The Meadowgrove Police Department urges anyone with information regarding the missing bus riders to come forward. Tips can be submitted anonymously through their dedicated hotline. The community awaits the resolution of this enigma, hoping that answers will bring a sense of closure and peace to the affected families and the town as a whole.",mistral
David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact,"Title: David Axelrod: I Woke Up This Morning as an Alternative Fact

In an unexpected turn of events, renowned political strategist and veteran commentator David Axelrod shared a bizarre experience on social media, likening his morning wake-up to becoming an ""alternative fact.""

Axelrod, who served as senior advisor to President Barack Obama, took to Twitter early this morning to express his bewilderment. His post read, ""Just woke up as an alternative fact. I can't even."" The tweet has since garnered thousands of likes, retweets, and comments, with many expressing their amusement and bewilderment.

When reached for comment, Axelrod elaborated on his unusual statement. ""I don't know what it was about this morning, but when I woke up, I felt like I was living in an alternate reality,"" he said. ""It was surreal, like I was no longer me, but this other thing that people keep talking about—an alternative fact.""

Axelrod went on to explain that he felt a sense of disconnect from his usual self, as if he was observing his own life from a distance. ""I've been in politics a long time, and I've seen my fair share of strange and unexpected things,"" he said. ""But this was something else entirely.""

While Axelrod's tweet has sparked a flurry of speculation and humor online, some have suggested that the political strategist may be commenting on the current state of American politics. In recent years, the term ""alternative facts"" has become synonymous with false or misleading information, often used to describe statements made by political figures that contradict verifiable evidence.

Axelrod himself has been a vocal critic of the use of alternative facts in politics, particularly in the context of the Trump administration. In a 2017 interview with CNN, he described the phenomenon as a dangerous trend that undermines the very foundations of democracy.

However, Axelrod insisted that his tweet was meant simply as a humorous observation of his own strange experience, rather than a comment on the broader political climate. ""I don't want to read too much into it,"" he said. ""I just woke up feeling a little off, and I thought it was funny to compare it to something that's become such a buzzword in politics.""

Despite the light-hearted nature of his tweet, Axelrod's experience has struck a chord with many people who feel similarly disillusioned by the current state of American politics. In a time of political polarization and mistrust, Axelrod's unexpected statement serves as a poignant reminder of the need for honesty, integrity, and fact-based discourse in our public life.

As for Axelrod, he seems to have recovered from his brief moment of alternate reality. He has since tweeted about his usual political analysis, offering insightful commentary on the latest developments in the world of American politics.

Yet, the memory of his unusual morning will undoubtedly linger, serving as a reminder of the strange and unpredictable world we live in, where even the most ordinary moments can feel like an alternative fact.",mistral
"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, NationÃ¢ÂÂs Largest","**Title**: Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure Mounts to Close School System, Nation's Largest

New York City, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, is facing mounting pressure to close its public school system, the largest in the nation. With over 1.1 million students and 150,000 staff members, the decision to shut down the schools could significantly impact the city's efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that schools will remain open for the time being, citing the need to ensure continuous learning and provide meals to students who rely on them. However, the mayor also acknowledged the growing concerns over the safety of students and staff in the face of the pandemic.

""We are in a difficult situation, and we understand the fears and concerns of our community,"" de Blasio said during a press conference. ""We are working tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of our students, staff, and families.""

The call to close the schools has been led by city council members, teachers' unions, and public health experts, who argue that keeping the schools open increases the risk of further spreading the virus. They point to the increasing number of confirmed cases among students and staff, as well as the potential for asymptomatic individuals to unknowingly transmit the disease.

""It's only a matter of time before we see a significant outbreak within our schools,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. ""Closing the schools is a necessary step to protect our most vulnerable populations and slow the spread of the virus.""

The New York City Department of Education has implemented a number of measures to reduce the risk of infection, including increased cleaning and disinfecting, mandatory handwashing, and the distribution of hand sanitizer. However, critics argue that these measures are not enough to ensure the safety of students and staff in the dense, crowded buildings.

The decision to close the schools would not be without its challenges. Many parents are essential workers who rely on the schools to provide childcare, and closing the schools could exacerbate the strain on the city's already overburdened healthcare system. Additionally, the closure would have significant economic consequences for the city, as schools are a major source of revenue for the city and state.

City officials are reportedly considering a number of options to address these concerns, including the implementation of remote learning, the provision of childcare for essential workers, and the distribution of meals to students at designated locations.

""We are exploring every option to ensure the continued education of our students and the safety of our families,"" said Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza. ""We will make a decision based on the best interests of our students and the health of our community.""

The pressure to close the schools in New York City is part of a larger nationwide trend, as school districts across the country grapple with the challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak. As of Wednesday, over 400 school districts in 29 states have closed, affecting millions of students.

In the meantime, city officials are urging residents to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including washing hands frequently, avoiding large gatherings, and staying home if feeling sick.

""We are all in this together, and we need to take responsible actions to protect ourselves and our community,"" said de Blasio. ""We will continue to work closely with health officials and community leaders to make the best decisions for the health and safety of our city.""

As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether New York City will join the growing list of school districts that have closed their doors in response to the coronavirus outbreak. What is certain is that the decision will have far-reaching consequences for the city, its schools, and its families.",mistral
Violence forces Haiti to cancel Carnival,"**Title**: Violence Forces Haiti to Cancel Carnival

**Port-au-Prince, Haiti** - Amidst escalating violence and political unrest, Haiti's government has announced the cancellation of this year's Carnival festivities, a move aimed at preserving national security and preventing further escalation of violence.

The annual Carnival, a vibrant celebration of Haitian culture, music, and heritage, was scheduled to take place from February 21-25. However, ongoing protests and clashes between security forces and demonstrators have made the event untenable.

""The security situation in the country is not conducive to holding a large-scale event like Carnival,"" said Haiti's Culture Minister Johannès Pierre in a press conference yesterday. ""We cannot risk the safety of our citizens, especially during such a sensitive period.""

The decision to cancel Carnival comes after weeks of protests, sparked by fuel price hikes and widespread discontent with the government. The unrest has led to numerous incidents of violence, leaving several dead and hundreds injured.

The cancellation of Carnival, a significant economic boost for the country, is expected to deal a heavy blow to businesses and artists who depend on the festivities for their livelihoods.

""This is a devastating blow for us,"" said Jean-Baptiste, a well-known Carnival band leader who preferred to withhold his full name for safety reasons. ""Carnival is more than just a celebration; it's our lifeline. We're left with nothing.""

The government has promised to provide financial assistance to those affected by the cancellation. However, the exact details and the extent of the aid are yet to be announced.

Meanwhile, the international community has expressed concern over the situation in Haiti. The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for urgent dialogue to address the root causes of the crisis and restore stability.

""I urge all parties to engage in a dialogue to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis,"" Guterres said in a statement. ""The people of Haiti deserve a better future.""

As Haiti grapples with its political crisis, the cancellation of Carnival serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the country. The government, international community, and citizens alike are called upon to work towards finding a peaceful resolution to the crisis and ensuring a safer, more prosperous future for Haiti.",mistral
McDonald's is selling a new Big Mac with four patties,"**McDonald's Introduces a Bigger, Beefier Big Mac**

Fast-food giant McDonald's has announced the release of a new version of its iconic Big Mac burger, featuring four beef patties instead of the traditional three. The new burger, dubbed the ""Grand Mac,"" is set to hit menus across the United States this month.

The Grand Mac, which was first tested in select locations in 2017, is an attempt by McDonald's to cater to customers who crave a heartier burger experience. The burger is said to be larger in size and has a thicker bun to accommodate the extra beef.

The Grand Mac retains the classic Big Mac ingredients, including special sauce, lettuce, cheese, onions, and pickles, sandwiched between a sesame seed bun. However, the addition of the fourth beef patty significantly increases the burger's calorie count. According to McDonald's nutritional information, the Grand Mac has 550 calories, 29 grams of fat, and 960 milligrams of sodium, compared to the original Big Mac's 540 calories, 25 grams of fat, and 950 milligrams of sodium.

McDonald's is marketing the Grand Mac as a limited-time offer, available for a suggested price of $5.19. The company has not yet announced how long the burger will be available on menus.

The launch of the Grand Mac comes as McDonald's continues to focus on expanding its menu offerings and improving the quality of its food. In recent years, the fast-food chain has introduced a variety of new items, including the McCafe coffee line, the McChicken Sandwich remake, and the Buttermilk Crispy Tenders.

However, the Grand Mac is not the first time McDonald's has experimented with a larger Big Mac. In 2011, the chain introduced the Big Mac Bacon Clubhouse, which featured four beef patties, bacon, and additional toppings. The burger was discontinued a few years later.

Reaction to the Grand Mac has been mixed, with some customers expressing excitement about the beefier burger, while others have criticized the increased calorie count. Some social media users have even joked about the need for a larger size bun to accommodate the extra patty.

Despite the mixed reaction, McDonald's remains optimistic about the Grand Mac's potential success. In a statement, McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said, ""We're always looking for new ways to evolve our menu to meet the changing needs and preferences of our customers. The Grand Mac is a great example of that, and we're excited to bring it to McDonald's restaurants nationwide.""

The Grand Mac is set to roll out to McDonald's locations across the United States starting this month. It remains to be seen whether the beefier burger will become a permanent addition to the chain's menu or simply a limited-time offering. For now, Big Mac fans can look forward to sinking their teeth into a bigger, beefier version of the classic sandwich.",mistral
BBC News,"**BBC News:** Tech Giants Partner to Develop AI-Powered Language Translation

In a historic collaboration, tech giants Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have announced a joint venture to develop an advanced AI-powered language translation system. The goal of this initiative is to enhance cross-cultural communication and break down linguistic barriers, particularly in the professional and business sectors.

The project, named ""Project Harmony,"" aims to create a translation service that not only accurately translates spoken and written language between multiple languages but also retains the nuances and cultural context of the original message. This is a significant leap forward from current translation technologies, which often fall short in capturing the subtleties of language and cultural differences.

""Project Harmony"" will leverage the collective resources, expertise, and AI research of the three tech giants. Google's deep learning capabilities, Microsoft's work in natural language processing, and Amazon's experience with voice recognition technology will be integrated to create a comprehensive and effective translation system.

According to the joint statement released by the companies, the aim is to make the new translation service accessible to a wide audience, including businesses, governments, and individuals. The service is expected to be available in multiple formats, such as mobile apps, web platforms, and integration with existing communication tools like email and messaging services.

The development of such a sophisticated AI-powered language translation system has the potential to revolutionize global communication. It could facilitate international collaboration, foster cross-cultural understanding, and promote economic growth by breaking down barriers to trade and investment.

However, the project also raises concerns about data privacy and security. The companies have pledged to prioritize user privacy and to adhere to the highest standards of data protection. They plan to implement robust security measures and offer users the option to opt-out of data collection for personal use.

The tech industry has welcomed the collaboration, with many seeing it as a positive step towards innovation and progress. Critics, on the other hand, have raised questions about the potential monopoly of information and the impact on smaller translation service providers.

The partnership between Google, Microsoft, and Amazon is a testament to the power of collaboration in driving technological advancement. As the project moves forward, the world will be watching to see if ""Project Harmony"" lives up to its promise of bridging linguistic gaps and fostering global understanding.

The development and rollout of the new AI-powered language translation system are expected to take several years. In the meantime, the three companies plan to engage with stakeholders, including linguists, cultural experts, and users, to ensure the system is culturally sensitive, accurate, and user-friendly.

Transcripts,"Title: Transcripts Reveal Shocking Details in High-Profile Case

In a stunning turn of events, recently unsealed transcripts from a high-profile court case have shed new light on the allegations at the center of the controversy. The documents, which were under seal for several months, contain testimonies of key witnesses and evidence that could potentially alter the course of the case.

The transcripts, obtained by our news outlet, detail the testimonies of several individuals who were present during the events in question. One of the most significant revelations comes from the testimony of John Doe, a former associate of the accused party. Doe claims to have witnessed the accused engaging in behavior that is contrary to their public persona and could potentially be criminal in nature.

In his testimony, Doe describes an incident that allegedly took place in a private setting. He claims to have been present when the accused made remarks that are being interpreted as threatening and aggressive. Doe also alleges that the accused was under the influence of substances during this incident.

Another key witness, Jane Smith, a former business partner of the accused, also testifies to behavior that she claims is out of character for the accused. Smith testifies that the accused made promises and commitments that they subsequently reneged on, causing significant financial losses to her business.

The transcripts also contain evidence that appears to contradict statements made by the accused during their initial interviews with law enforcement. For instance, the accused was questioned about their whereabouts on a specific date, and they provided a detailed alibi. However, phone records and other evidence presented in the transcripts appear to contradict this alibi.

The revelations in the transcripts have sent shockwaves through the public and the legal community. The accused's legal team has issued a statement, calling the allegations ""baseless and malicious,"" and vowing to ""vigorously defend"" their client.

The case, which has been closely followed by the public, has taken yet another unexpected turn with the release of these transcripts. The transcripts are expected to be a central focus during the upcoming court proceedings, and their impact on the case remains to be seen.

Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"Title: Are Cell Phone Calls on Airplane Flights Inevitable?

In the annals of air travel, few topics have sparked as much debate as the question of whether to allow cell phone calls during flights. As technology continues to evolve, some believe that the ban on in-flight calls is an antiquated relic of a bygone era. Others argue that the quietude of air travel is a sacred tradition that should be preserved.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) currently prohibits the use of mobile phones for voice calls during flights below 10,000 feet due to concerns about interference with the aircraft's communication systems. However, with advancements in cellular technology, some airlines are exploring the possibility of lifting this ban.

One of the primary arguments in favor of allowing cell phone calls is the potential economic benefits. Proponents suggest that allowing calls could lead to increased productivity for business travelers, who could conduct meetings and transactions mid-flight. This, in turn, could boost airline revenue by attracting more business travelers.

Moreover, proponents argue that the ban on cell phone calls is outdated, given the widespread availability of Wi-Fi on flights. Many passengers use their phones for internet browsing, streaming, and sending messages, but the ban on voice calls seems arbitrary in this context.

However, opponents of in-flight calls argue that they would disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of air travel. Flights, they contend, are one of the few remaining spaces where people can disconnect from the constant barrage of information and noise that characterizes modern life. Allowing calls, they fear, could transform flights into cacophonous, stressful environments.

Furthermore, opponents worry about the potential impact on other passengers' privacy. In a confined space, even a brief conversation could potentially be overheard by fellow travelers, leading to potential embarrassment or discomfort.

The debate over in-flight calls is complex and multifaceted, involving considerations of safety, economics, and the social fabric of air travel. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that the issue will continue to be hotly debated.

In the meantime, some airlines are experimenting with solutions that might bridge the gap between the proponents and opponents of in-flight calls. For example, some airlines are offering ""quiet zones"" where calls are prohibited, allowing passengers to choose whether they wish to be surrounded by the sounds of conversation or peaceful silence.

Others are exploring the use of technology to block cell phone signals within the cabin, ensuring that calls cannot be made during flights. This would address safety concerns while still allowing passengers to use their phones for internet browsing and messaging.

Ultimately, the future of in-flight calls remains uncertain. While some may lament the potential loss of a quiet sanctuary in the sky, others may welcome the opportunity to stay connected even at 30,000 feet. As the debate continues, it is clear that the issue will require careful consideration and a balancing of competing interests.

In the end, the decision may come down to a matter of personal preference. For those who value the quietude of air travel, there may be the option to seek out flights that prohibit calls. For those who prioritize connectivity, there may be the opportunity to stay connected no matter where they are in the world.

Regardless of the eventual outcome, one thing is certain: the debate over in-flight calls is a reflection of our broader society, where the role of technology in our lives is a source of both excitement and concern. As we continue to navigate this complex landscape, it is important to remember that compromise and understanding are essential components of any solution.

In the meantime, as the plane takes off and the seatbelt sign is turned off, passengers can continue to sit back, relax, and savor the unique and cherished peace of the air travel experience. Whether or not that peace will be disrupted by the ringing of cell phones remains to be seen.",mistral
"On Friday the 13th we wonder why, scientifically, we believe in superstitions","Title: On Friday the 13th, a Look into the Scientific Explanation Behind Superstitions

Friday the 13th, a day that strikes fear and apprehension in the hearts of many, has once again arrived. This date, shrouded in superstition, is believed by some to be unlucky and fraught with misfortune. But why do we subscribe to these beliefs, and what is the scientific basis behind our fear of Friday the 13th?

The origins of Friday the 13th's superstition are murky, with various theories tracing its roots to Christianity, Norse mythology, and even numerology. However, the psychological and neurological underpinnings of these beliefs are more clearly understood.

One of the key factors is the amyggdala, a small but critical part of the brain that plays a crucial role in processing emotions, especially fear. According to a study published in the journal Neuropsychologia, the mere exposure to the number 13 activates the amyggdala, causing a spike in anxiety and fear responses.

This response is not limited to the number 13, but extends to other superstitions as well. For instance, the fear of spiders (arachnophobia) or snakes (ophidiophobia) can be attributed to our evolutionary past, where these creatures posed a real threat to our ancestors. Today, these fears persist, even though we are no longer in immediate danger from these animals.

Our brains have a tendency to overgeneralize and associate, a process known as the ""availability heuristic."" This means that we are more likely to remember and fear events that are more easily recalled, such as a friend who was involved in a car accident on a Friday or a horror movie set on the 13th. This, in turn, reinforces our superstitions and makes them seem more plausible.

Another factor is cognitive dissonance, a psychological term that describes the mental discomfort experienced by holding two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. For example, a person who believes in fate ( determinism ) but also values free will (indeterminism) may feel a sense of discomfort and uncertainty. Superstitions can provide a sense of control and order in an otherwise chaotic world, reducing cognitive dissonance and offering a sense of comfort.

However, it's important to note that superstitions are not grounded in facts or evidence. They are not based on rational thought or empirical evidence, but rather on cognitive biases, cultural conditioning, and personal experiences. While they may offer a sense of comfort and control, they can also lead to irrational fear and avoidance of certain situations or numbers.

On the other hand, some argue that superstitions, despite their lack of basis in fact, can have positive effects. For instance, the belief that a lucky charm can lead to success may boost self-confidence and motivation, leading to better performance.

As Friday the 13th passes, it's worth considering why we hold onto these superstitions. While they may be rooted in our evolutionary past and influenced by cognitive biases, they ultimately serve as a reminder of the power of the mind and the human tendency to seek patterns and meaning in the world around us.

Whether you're a firm believer in superstitions or a skeptic, Friday the 13th offers an opportunity to reflect on our beliefs, the role of the mind in shaping our reality, and the enduring power of superstition in human culture.

Zuckerberg's important message on miscarriage,"**Title:** Zuckerberg's Important Message on Miscarriage

**Subtitle:** Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg opens up about his wife's miscarriage, shedding light on a common yet often taboo subject.

In a heartfelt post on Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, have shared their personal experience with a miscarriage, aiming to destigmatize this common yet often secretive aspect of pregnancy.

The couple, who are parents to daughter Maxima, revealed that they recently lost a pregnancy. Zuckerberg wrote, ""Priscilla and I have some painful news to share from earlier this year... we lost a pregnancy early on, and had several miscarriages this year.""

Zuckerberg's candid admission comes as a refreshing change in a society where miscarriages are often shrouded in silence, leaving many women feeling isolated and ashamed. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, approximately 10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.

Zuckerberg's post highlights the importance of open conversations about miscarriages. He wrote, ""There's a lot of discussion in our society about female empowerment. For women going through this, you're not alone, and I want to do my part to destigmatize discussion on these topics,"" he added, ""You are amazingly strong.""

The Facebook CEO's revelation has sparked a wave of support and empathy from social media users, with many sharing their own stories of loss. One user commented, ""Thank you for sharing this. I lost a pregnancy 10 years ago and it's still one of the hardest things I've ever gone through."" Another wrote, ""I lost a pregnancy 2 years ago and it was the darkest time of my life. Reading your post brought tears to my eyes, and I feel a little less alone.""

Zuckerberg's post also highlights the physical and emotional toll miscarriages can take on women. He wrote, ""I've heard from so many people that they felt pressured to keep their miscarriages secret, because they were afraid of the reaction they'd face. That's exactly why Priscilla and I decided to share our experience.""

The couple's decision to open up about their loss is part of a broader movement to break the silence around miscarriages and reduce the stigma associated with them. Organizations like the Miscarriage Association and the March of Dimes are working to increase awareness and provide support for those affected by miscarriage.

Zuckerberg's post serves as a reminder that miscarriages are a common part of pregnancy and that it's essential to create a supportive environment for those who experience them. As one user wrote, ""Thank you for speaking out about this. It's time we normalize these conversations and support each other through the difficult times.""

In conclusion, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan's candid discussion about their miscarriage has sparked a much-needed conversation about a sensitive and often overlooked aspect of pregnancy. Their openness has provided comfort and support to many who have gone through similar experiences, and it serves as a call to action for society to create a more empathetic and supportive environment for those affected by miscarriage.",mistral

Directed by Jason Orley, the coming-of-age comedy-drama sees Davidson play Zeke, a 23-year-old dropout who befriends 16-year-old Mo (Griffin Gluck). Zeke, with his carefree attitude and rebellious spirit, serves as a mentor to the naive and inexperienced Mo.

While Davidson's comedic timing is on point, his role in ""Big Time Adolescence"" seems to be a rehash of the characters he has previously portrayed. Zeke is a slightly more mature version of the lovable yet troubled characters Davidson has played in shows like ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The King of Staten Island.""

The film's premise, while promising, fails to explore Zeke's character in depth, leaving viewers with a one-dimensional portrayal of the character. Davidson's performance lacks the nuanced complexity that would make Zeke a truly memorable character.

However, it's not all bad news. Davidson's chemistry with Gluck is undeniable, and their dynamic provides some of the film's most engaging moments. Gluck delivers a heartfelt performance as Mo, a character grappling with the complexities of adolescence.

The supporting cast, including Emily Arlook as Mo's sister, and O’Shea Jackson Jr. as Mo's father, also deliver strong performances, adding depth to the narrative.

""Big Time Adolescence"" is a visually stunning film, with cinematography that captures the vibrancy and energy of youth. The film's soundtrack, featuring tracks from the likes of The Strokes and The Ramones, adds to the film's nostalgic appeal.

In conclusion, while ""Big Time Adolescence"" is a visually appealing and entertaining film, it fails to offer much in the way of originality when it comes to Pete Davidson's character. Despite this, Davidson's charisma and the strong performances of the supporting cast make it worth a watch for fans of the comedian and coming-of-age films.

""Big Time Adolescence"" is now streaming on Hulu. Viewers should approach the film with an open mind, understanding that while it may not push the boundaries of comedic acting, it offers an engaging and entertaining storyline.",mistral
"In Earth's early history, a day was 23.5 hours and a year lasted 372 days","Title: Earth's Early History Reveals 23.5-Hour Days and 372-Day Years

In a groundbreaking discovery that sheds new light on Earth's distant past, researchers have uncovered evidence suggesting that a day on Earth was once 23.5 hours long, and a year lasted approximately 372 days. This revelation, published in the journal Nature, challenges previous beliefs about the early rotation and orbital dynamics of our planet.

The findings are based on an analysis of zircon crystals, some of the oldest known materials on Earth, which were formed around 4.4 billion years ago. By examining the patterns of uranium and lead isotopes within these crystals, scientists were able to determine the exact timing of the crystals' formation, providing a window into Earth's early geological history.

""Our research has revealed that the Earth's rotation was significantly slower in its early years, with a day lasting around 23.5 hours,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jane Thompson of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). ""This is a major shift from our current understanding of a 24-hour day.""

The team also found that the Earth's year was significantly shorter, with a duration of approximately 372 days. This is a stark contrast to the 365.25-day solar calendar we use today.

The changes in Earth's rotation and revolution are believed to be the result of a series of colossal impacts from celestial bodies, such as asteroids and planetesimals, during the early stages of our planet's formation. These impacts caused extensive damage to the Earth's crust and molten mantle, which in turn affected the planet's rotation and orbital characteristics.

""The Earth was a very different place in its early years,"" said Dr. Thompson. ""Our findings provide a unique insight into the geological and climatological conditions that existed on our planet billions of years ago.""

The discovery has far-reaching implications for our understanding of Earth's early history, as well as the development of life on our planet. For instance, a longer day would have significantly impacted the Earth's climate, with more pronounced changes in temperature and light throughout the day. Similarly, a shorter year would have resulted in more frequent and drastic seasonal changes.

The research also raises questions about the origin and evolution of life on Earth. ""Life has to adapt to the conditions it finds itself in,"" said Dr. Thompson. ""If the day was longer and the year was shorter, this could have had a profound impact on the development and survival of early life forms.""

The team plans to continue their research, using a variety of geological and astronomical techniques to further investigate Earth's early history. They hope to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how our planet evolved, and how these changes might have impacted the development of life.

""This is just the beginning of our journey into Earth's distant past,"" said Dr. Thompson. ""We have so much more to learn about our planet and its early history.""

The discovery of Earth's early 23.5-hour days and 372-day years marks a significant milestone in our understanding of the history of our planet. As we continue to uncover the mysteries of our past, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complex and dynamic processes that have shaped our world.

In the words of Dr. Thompson, ""Every new discovery we make about Earth's early history is another piece of the puzzle, helping us to understand the incredible journey our planet has taken to become the home we know today.""",mistral
Coronavirus decisions creates big burden for college students,"Title: ""Coronavirus Decisions Create Big Burden for College Students""

As colleges and universities across the nation grapple with how to safely reopen campuses amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the burden of these decisions is falling heavily on the shoulders of students.

With the fall semester fast approaching, students are left in a precarious position, balancing academic progress with health and safety concerns. The decision to return to campus, made by institutions and students alike, carries significant financial, emotional, and logistical implications.

Financial pressures loom large for many students, particularly those who rely on campus jobs, scholarships, and financial aid to cover tuition and living expenses. The uncertain future of campus operations, coupled with the potential for increased costs associated with COVID-19 safety measures, has left many students wondering how they will afford their education.

""I was really hoping to get a job on campus this year to help with tuition, but with everything online, I don't know if there will be any opportunities,"" said Sarah Johnson, a sophomore at the University of Michigan. ""I'm not sure how I'm going to pay for school if I can't work.""

Emotional stress is another factor that students are grappling with. The fear of contracting the virus, the uncertainty of what the semester will look like, and the potential for social isolation are all taking a toll on the mental health of students.

""I'm really scared about going back to school,"" said Emily Davis, a junior at the University of California, Berkeley. ""I don't know if I'll be able to make friends or have the same college experience I was looking forward to. And with everything online, it's hard to feel connected to the school and my classmates.""

Logistical challenges also abound for students, particularly those who live on campus. Dorm rooms are being reconfigured to promote social distancing, and students are being asked to follow strict guidelines regarding mask-wearing, handwashing, and gathering.

""It's going to be really difficult to live in the dorms with all these new rules,"" said John Smith, a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin. ""I don't know if I'll be able to make friends or have a normal college experience with all these restrictions.""

Some students have chosen to forego the traditional college experience altogether, opting instead for online classes from the safety of their homes. This decision, however, is not without its own set of challenges.

""I was really looking forward to going away to college and living on my own, but with everything online, it just doesn't feel the same,"" said Jane Doe, a freshman at the University of Florida. ""I miss the social aspect of being on campus and the sense of community that comes with it. It's hard to feel connected to the school and my classmates when I'm sitting in my bedroom at home.""

As the pandemic continues to evolve, the decisions colleges and universities make will have far-reaching implications for their students. The burden of these decisions is heavy, and students are left grappling with uncertainty and anxiety as they navigate this new normal.

""I just want to be able to focus on my education and have a normal college experience, but it feels like there are so many obstacles in my way,"" said Sarah Johnson. ""I just hope that things will get better soon and that I can have the college experience I was looking forward to.""

As the nation watches and waits to see how colleges and universities navigate the challenges of the pandemic, one thing is clear: the decisions being made will have a lasting impact on the lives of students for years to come.",mistral
The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games,"Title: The Tourism Legacy of the Olympic Games

In the aftermath of the Olympic Games, cities worldwide often witness a surge in tourism, with the Games leaving a lasting impact on the host destinations. This phenomenon is not a new one, as the Olympic Games have long been a catalyst for increased global interest in host cities, leading to a significant boost in tourism and economic growth.

The 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, serve as a prime example of this tourism legacy. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Tokyo welcomed over 10 million foreign tourists during the Games, marking a 15-year record for inbound tourism in the city. The influx of visitors generated an estimated $11 billion in spending, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

Moreover, the Tokyo Games highlighted the city's cultural attractions, such as the historic Asakusa district and the Meiji Shrine, as well as its modern architecture, including the iconic Tokyo Skytree and the newly constructed National Stadium. These landmarks undoubtedly contributed to the city's allure for tourists, both during and after the Games.

The Olympic Games in London, held in 2012, also experienced a tourism boom following the event. According to VisitBritain, the country saw a 6.4% increase in overseas visitor arrivals in the year following the Games, with a total of 33.4 million tourists. This surge was largely attributed to the widespread global exposure of London's iconic landmarks, such as Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, and the British Museum, during the Games.

Similarly, the 2008 Beijing Olympics had a profound impact on tourism in China's capital city. The Games boosted Beijing's international profile, drawing attention to its rich history and cultural heritage, as well as its modern architecture, such as the Bird's Nest Stadium and the Water Cube. According to a report by the World Tourism Organization, Beijing's international tourist arrivals increased by 14.5% in 2008, the year of the Games, and continued to grow in the following years.

However, the tourism legacy of the Olympic Games is not without its challenges. The influx of tourists can strain infrastructure and public services, leading to issues such as traffic congestion, overcrowding, and increased pollution. Moreover, the cost of hosting the Olympics, which often runs into billions of dollars, can burden host cities and countries for years to come, diverting resources from other much-needed public services.

Despite these challenges, the tourism legacy of the Olympic Games is undeniable. Cities that host the Games often experience a surge in international interest, boosting their tourism industries and driving economic growth. As the world awaits the next Olympic host city, it is clear that the Games will continue to leave a lasting impact on the global tourism landscape.",mistral

Fly in a WWI fighter plane,"**Experience the Thrill of a Lifetime: Flying a WWI Fighter Plane**

In an era where supersonic jets and drones dominate the skies, a rare opportunity arises for modern-day aviation enthusiasts to step back in time and experience the raw, unfiltered thrill of flying a World War I (WWI) fighter plane.

Nestled amidst the picturesque landscapes of southern England lies the Shoreham Aircraft Museum, home to one of the largest collections of vintage aircraft in the United Kingdom. Among its prized possessions is a fully-restored Sopwith Camel, a British single-seat biplane fighter used extensively during WWI.

For a select few, the museum offers the unique chance to climb aboard this historic aircraft and take to the skies, experiencing the sensory overload that pilots of yesteryear faced. The experience begins with a thorough briefing from a seasoned pilot, who shares tales of daring dogfights and harrowing escapes from enemy fire.

Once buckled in and equipped with a leather helmet and goggles, the experience quickly becomes real as the engine roars to life beneath you. The propeller whirrs and spins, creating a deafening symphony that drowns out all other sounds. The plane Taxies down the runway, its wheels bouncing and spitting gravel as it gains speed.

As the plane lifts off, the ground recedes beneath you at an alarming pace. The sensation is both exhilarating and terrifying, a stark contrast to the smooth, silent ascent of modern aircraft. The controls are sensitive and unforgiving, requiring constant adjustments to maintain altitude and direction.

The flight itself is a rollercoaster ride through the skies, with breathtaking views of the English countryside interspersed with moments of white-knuckle tension as the plane dives and climbs in response to the pilot's commands. The open cockpit offers an unobstructed view of the world below, while the wind howls past your ears and the cold air bites at your face.

Despite the modern safety measures in place, there is an undeniable sense of danger that adds to the experience. The Sopwith Camel is a fragile machine, with no modern conveniences like autopilot or radar to guide it. Every maneuver must be executed with precision and skill, or risk sending the plane spiraling towards the earth.

Upon landing, the adrenaline rush subsides, replaced by a newfound appreciation for the pilots who braved the skies during WWI. The experience is not for the faint of heart, but for those who seek a taste of history and the thrill of adventure, it is an opportunity not to be missed.

Why women feel pressured to shave,"Title: Why Women Feel Pressured to Shave

In a society where body hair has long been seen as taboo for women, a growing movement is challenging the norm and encouraging self-expression. However, many women still feel pressured to remove their body hair, whether for personal reasons or due to societal expectations.

The origins of this pressure can be traced back to the early 20th century, when advertisements for Gillette's new razor for women, the Milady Décolletée, hit the market. The ad featured a scantily clad woman holding a razor, with the caption, ""You'll wonder where the missing link was all your life."" This marketing strategy tapped into the emerging ideal of the ""modern woman,"" who was expected to be clean, groomed, and sexually attractive.

Fast forward to the present day, and the beauty industry continues to profit from this pressure. From razors and waxing strips to laser hair removal treatments, the options for hair removal are numerous and expensive. The constant bombardment of images in media of hairless women can create a subconscious pressure for women to conform, leading to feelings of inadequacy if they choose not to remove their body hair.

Women who choose to embrace their body hair often face backlash and judgment, whether it be from friends, family, or strangers. This can lead to feelings of isolation and shame, as women may feel that they are deviating from the societal norm. However, the body positivity movement is helping to change this narrative, with more and more women speaking out about their choice to go au naturel and challenging the beauty standards that have been imposed upon them.

One woman, who asked to remain anonymous, shared her experience with feeling pressured to shave. ""Growing up, I never really thought much about my body hair, but as I got older and started dating, I felt like I had to shave to be attractive. It was a constant battle, and it made me feel self-conscious and uncomfortable.""

The pressure to shave can also have negative physical and emotional effects. Removing body hair can lead to irritation, ingrown hairs, and even infection. Additionally, the constant battle to stay hair-free can contribute to feelings of anxiety and stress.

Despite these challenges, there are many women who are choosing to reject the pressure to shave and embrace their body hair. Some are even using social media to share their experiences and inspire others to join them in their journey towards body positivity.

One such woman is model and activist, Hannah Berner. In an interview with Glamour, Berner shared her thoughts on the pressure to shave, saying, ""I think it's important for women to understand that their body hair is normal and natural, and that they have the right to do whatever makes them feel comfortable and confident.""

As the body positivity movement continues to gain momentum, it is hoped that the pressure to shave will one day become a thing of the past. Until then, it is important for women to remember that they have the power to make their own choices about their bodies and to embrace their individuality.

In conclusion, the pressure to shave is a complex issue that is deeply rooted in society's beauty standards. While progress is being made towards body positivity and self-expression, many women still feel pressure to remove their body hair. It is important for women to remember that their body hair is normal and natural, and that they have the right to do whatever makes them feel comfortable and confident. The movement towards body positivity and self-expression is a step in the right direction, and it is hoped that one day the pressure to shave will become a thing of the past.",mistral
Broadway theaters to suspend all performances because of coronavirus,"**Broadway Theaters to Suspend All Performances Due to Coronavirus**

New York, NY – In an unprecedented move to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, all Broadway theaters will suspend performances effective immediately, according to a joint announcement made by the Broadway League and the Actors' Equity Association.

The decision, which affects 41 theaters and hundreds of shows, comes as concerns about the virus's impact on public health continue to grow.

""The health and well-being of Broadway theatergoers, performers, stagehands, and employees remain our number one priority,"" said Charlotte St. Martin, President of the Broadway League, in a statement. ""Given the city's traumatic experience with the coronavirus, and in light of the increasing number of reported cases, we believe we must do our part as responsible citizens to curb the spread of the virus.""

The suspension will last through Sunday, April 12, although the league and the union will continue to reassess the situation and provide updates on a weekly basis.

During the suspension, all ticket holders will receive refunds or exchanges for a future performance, depending on the policies of the specific show and theater.

This decision follows a series of cancellations and postponements across the theater world, including major productions in London, Paris, and Vienna.

In New York City, other cultural institutions, such as museums and concert venues, have also announced temporary closures or reduced hours.

""The Broadway community is heartbroken to take this step, knowing the challenging implications for our industry,"" added Mary McColl, Executive Director of Actors' Equity Association. ""But we know it is the right thing to do under the circumstances.""

The suspension affects a wide range of shows, from long-running classics like ""Hamilton"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"" to new productions like ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""Jagged Little Pill.""

The Broadway League and Actors' Equity Association have been working closely with city and state officials, as well as health experts, to monitor the situation and develop guidelines for the safe reopening of theaters.

""We are grateful for the extraordinary cooperation of all parties involved, and we are confident that we will be able to welcome audiences back to our theaters as soon as it is safe to do so,"" said St. Martin.

The suspension of performances is an indication of the seriousness with which the entertainment industry is taking the coronavirus outbreak. It also underscores the interconnectedness of global culture and the need for collective action in times of crisis.

As the situation continues to evolve, many are looking to the arts community for leadership and inspiration. The decision to suspend performances sends a clear message: the health and well-being of all is paramount, and the show will go on when it is safe to do so.

In the meantime, the Broadway community is encouraging everyone to stay informed, take precautions, and support one another during these challenging times.

""We ask everyone to join us in following the guidelines set forth by public health officials, and to remember that, even when we cannot gather in our theaters, the spirit of Broadway lives on,"" said McColl. ""We will get through this together, and we look forward to welcoming you back to our stages as soon as it is safe to do so.""",mistral
Thousands forced to work on Brazil's cattle ranches,"Title: Thousands Forced to Work on Brazil's Cattle Ranches

In a grim revelation, human rights groups and investigative journalists have uncovered evidence of thousands of workers living in inhumane conditions on Brazil's vast cattle ranches. The workers, primarily immigrants from neighboring countries, are allegedly forced into labor under threat of violence and deprived of basic rights.

The investigations, conducted over several months, paint a picture of exploitation and abuse on a massive scale. Workers, many of whom are undocumented, are reportedly trapped in a cycle of debt bondage, forced to work long hours in exchange for meager wages or food. Their living conditions are described as appalling, with inadequate housing, lack of access to clean water, and no healthcare facilities.

""It's modern-day slavery,"" said a representative from a leading human rights organization, requesting anonymity for safety reasons. ""These workers are treated as mere commodities, with no regard for their rights or dignity.""

The investigations have highlighted the complicity of the Brazilian government and the cattle industry in this exploitation. According to the investigators, local authorities often turn a blind eye to the abuses, while the industry benefits from cheap, exploitable labor.

The findings have sparked outrage and calls for action from human rights groups, politicians, and the public. Some have called for stricter laws to protect workers' rights, while others have demanded a complete overhaul of the cattle industry.

""This is not just about improving working conditions for these workers, it's about upholding basic human rights,"" said a spokesperson for Amnesty International. ""The Brazilian government must take immediate action to end this abuse and hold those responsible accountable.""

The Brazilian government has yet to respond to the allegations. However, the Ministry of Labor has announced plans to conduct its own investigations into the matter.

The revelations come at a time when Brazil's cattle industry is under scrutiny for its environmental impact. The Amazon rainforest, home to a vast array of species and crucial in the fight against climate change, has been ravaged by deforestation, much of it driven by cattle ranching.

The plight of the thousands of workers on Brazil's cattle ranches serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of this industry. As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and the protection of human rights, the need for reform in Brazil's cattle industry has never been more urgent.

In the meantime, the workers continue to toil in harsh conditions, with little hope for a better future. Their stories underscore the need for action, not just in Brazil, but globally, to eradicate exploitation and ensure that all workers, regardless of their nationality or the industry they work in, are treated with dignity and respect.",mistral

**Scientists Discover New Species of Deep-Sea Squid**

In a groundbreaking discovery, a team of international marine scientists has identified a new species of deep-sea squid, expanding our understanding of the ocean's biodiversity. The new squid, tentatively named *Vampyroteuthis infernus mirabilis*, was found during an expedition to the Kermadec Trench, the world's third deepest trench.

The discovery was made by a multinational team of scientists from the National Oceanography Centre (UK), the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (New Zealand), and the University of Otago (New Zealand), among others. The team was exploring the Kermadec Trench as part of the Nekton Deep Ocean Mission, a groundbreaking research project aimed at better understanding the deep ocean.

The *Vampyroteuthis infernus mirabilis* is a remarkable creature, with a unique set of adaptations for life in the crushing pressure and near-freezing temperatures of the deep sea. It possesses a gelatinous body, a pair of long, tentacle-like arms, and bioluminescent markings that likely serve as a means of communication or camouflage.

Dr. Jane Goodwin, a marine biologist from the National Oceanography Centre and a member of the team that discovered the new species, described the discovery as ""a significant milestone in our understanding of the deep sea."" She continued, ""This squid is a testament to the incredible diversity of life in the deep ocean, and it highlights the importance of continued research and exploration.""

The *Vampyroteuthis infernus mirabilis* is a close relative of the vampire squid, a well-known deep-sea creature that is capable of producing bioluminescent light to communicate, camouflage, and ward off predators. However, the new species exhibits some unique characteristics, including a more streamlined body and a different pattern of bioluminescent markings.

The discovery of the *Vampyroteuthis infernus mirabilis* is just the latest in a series of major findings by the Nekton Deep Ocean Mission. The project, which began in 2017, aims to explore and better understand the deep ocean, a critical but poorly understood ecosystem that covers more than half of the planet.

As the world grapples with the challenges posed by climate change, the deep ocean is increasingly being recognized as a critical factor in global carbon cycling. The Nekton Deep Ocean Mission is part of a global effort to better understand the deep ocean and its role in the Earth's climate system.

The discovery of the *Vampyroteuthis infernus mirabilis* is a reminder of the incredible diversity of life that exists in the deep ocean, and it underscores the importance of continued research and exploration. As Dr. Goodwin put it, ""The deep sea is a world like no other, and every new discovery helps us to better understand our planet and our place within it.""

The team plans to continue their research on the *Vampyroteuthis infernus mirabilis* and other deep-sea species as part of the Nekton Deep Ocean Mission. Their findings will help to advance our understanding of the deep sea and its role in the Earth's climate system, and they may even lead to new insights into the origins of life on Earth.

The discovery of the *Vampyroteuthis infernus mirabilis* is a testament to the power of scientific exploration and the importance of understanding the world around us. As we continue to unlock the secrets of the deep ocean, we gain a deeper appreciation for the incredible diversity of life on our planet and the critical role that the deep sea plays in maintaining a healthy and sustainable planet.

Step into the world of America's most notorious gangster,"Title: Step into the World of America's Most Notorious Gangster

In the annals of American criminal history, few names loom as large and as menacing as Al Capone. Born in 1899 in Brooklyn, New York, Capone would rise to become the undisputed king of Chicago's criminal underworld during the Prohibition era, a time when the production, sale, and consumption of alcohol were banned.

Capone's ascension to power was a tale of ambition, violence, and ruthless cunning. After a brief stint in the U.S. Army, Capone returned to his native New York, where he quickly became involved in organized crime. In 1920, he was recruited by Johnny Torrio, a powerful Chicago gangster, to help run his illegal operations in Chicago.

Capone's first years in Chicago were marked by a series of violent power struggles with rival gangs. He was instrumental in the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, in which seven members of a rival gang were gunned down in broad daylight. The massacre, which shocked the nation, solidified Capone's position as the most feared gangster in America.

Capone's empire was built on the illegal sale of alcohol, gambling, and prostitution. He controlled a vast network of speakeasies, brothels, and casinos, earning millions of dollars in profits each year. Capone's methods were brutal, and he was not above using violence, intimidation, and bribery to maintain his power and control.

Capone's reign as the king of Chicago's underworld ended in 1931, when he was indicted on federal income tax evasion charges. Despite his attempts to bribe and intimidate government officials, Capone was convicted in 1931 and sentenced to eleven years in prison.

In prison, Capone's health began to deteriorate, and he was diagnosed with syphilis, which had gone untreated for many years. He was eventually released from prison in 1939, but his health continued to decline, and he passed away in 1947 at the age of 48.

Capone's legacy as America's most notorious gangster lives on, and he remains a fascinating and controversial figure. His life story has been the subject of countless books, movies, and television shows, and he continues to captivate audiences with his larger-than-life persona and his ruthless tactics.

Despite Capone's criminal activities, some argue that he was a product of his time, and that he was simply trying to survive in a world where the rules were often bent or broken. Others see him as a symbol of the excesses of the Roaring Twenties, a time when crime and corruption ran rampant, and when the pursuit of wealth and power knew no bounds.

Whatever one's views on Capone, there is no denying that he was a remarkable and unforgettable figure. He was a man who rose from humble beginnings to become the most feared gangster in America, and who left an indelible mark on the criminal underworld of the 20th century.

As we step into the world of Al Capone, we are reminded of the power of ambition, the allure of wealth and power, and the lengths to which some will go to achieve their dreams. Capone's story is a cautionary tale, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the consequences of choosing the wrong path. But it is also a testament to the enduring power of the American dream, and to the fascination that we continue to feel for those who dared to chase it at any cost.",mistral

The unsung car designer who created the DeLorean and James Bond's underwater car,"**Title:** The Unsung Car Designer Who Created the DeLorean and James Bond's Underwater Car

#### John DeLorean's Lesser-Known Design Partner: Giugiaro's Influential Legacy

In the annals of automotive design, names like Enzo Ferrari, Lee Iacocca, and Carroll Shelby often take center stage. Yet, there exists a lesser-known figure who played a pivotal role in shaping some of the most iconic vehicles in cinematic history: Giorgetto Giugiaro.

Giugiaro, an Italian automobile designer, was the creative force behind several groundbreaking designs, including the DeLorean DMC-12, the time-traveling car from the ""Back to the Future"" series, and the Lotus Esprit S1, the underwater vehicle driven by James Bond in ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""

Born in 1930 in Italy, Giugiaro's passion for automobiles was ignited at an early age. After studying at the Institute of Industrial Design in Turin, he began his career at Carrozzeria Ghia, a prestigious Italian coachbuilder. It was during this time that he honed his skills and developed the design philosophy that would later define his career.

In 1968, Giugiaro co-founded Italdesign, an independent automotive design and engineering consultancy. This move proved to be a turning point in his career, allowing him to work with a diverse range of automakers, including Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen.

One of Giugiaro's most famous designs emerged from his collaboration with John DeLorean, the former president of General Motors and founder of the DeLorean Motor Company (DMC). The DeLorean DMC-12, with its sleek stainless steel body and distinctive gull-wing doors, was a radical departure from the boxy designs of the time.

Despite its unique aesthetic, the DMC-12 faced numerous production challenges, leading to delays and high costs. By the time it was released in 1981, the car was already viewed as outdated, and its high price tag ensured it would never achieve widespread success. However, the DMC-12's enduring popularity can be attributed to its starring role in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, which cemented its place in pop culture history.

Another iconic vehicle that bears Giugiaro's signature is the Lotus Esprit S1, which made its debut in 1976. The Esprit was designed to challenge the dominance of Ferrari and Lamborghini in the supercar market. Its futuristic design, featuring a distinctive wedge shape and hidden headlights, was a testament to Giugiaro's forward-thinking approach to automotive design.

The Esprit's most memorable on-screen appearance came in 1977, when it was chosen as James Bond's underwater vehicle in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" The scene, in which Bond drives the Esprit off a pier and into the water, was groundbreaking at the time and has since become one of the most iconic moments in Bond film history.

While Giugiaro's designs for DeLorean and the Lotus Esprit are undeniably iconic, his influence extends far beyond these two vehicles. Over the course of his career, he designed or co-designed over 350 cars for various automakers, including the Alfa Romeo Alfasud, the Maserati Bora, and the Volkswagen Golf.

In recognition of his contributions to the automotive industry, Giugiaro was awarded the Compasso d'Oro, Italy's most prestigious design award, on multiple occasions. He was also inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2002.

Giugiaro passed away in 2018 at the age of 88. His legacy lives on in the countless vehicles that bear his design influence, from the iconic cars of the silver screen to the everyday cars that fill our streets.

You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies,"Title: ""You can't build the truth on a scaffold of lies""

In the world of politics, truth and deception often dance in a delicate balance, leaving the public to grapple with the complexities of governance. A recent series of events has shed light on the importance of honesty and integrity, reminding us that a foundation built on lies crumbles under scrutiny.

The recent controversy surrounding the construction project of a high-profile political figure serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of dishonesty. The project, hailed as a symbol of progress and economic development, has been shrouded in controversy due to allegations of mismanagement, corruption, and outright deception.

At the heart of the controversy is the questionable use of funds, with several reports suggesting a significant misappropriation. The political figure, in an attempt to defend his project, has been making bold promises and sweeping statements, painting a picture of a flawless endeavor. However, a closer look at the facts paints a different picture.

A detailed investigation by a team of independent auditors has uncovered a web of financial irregularities. The report, released to the public, paints a picture of a project riddled with inflated costs, unjustified expenditures, and questionable contracts. The auditors' findings have raised serious questions about the transparency and accountability of the project.

In response to the damning report, the political figure has doubled down on his claims, accusing the auditors of bias and conspiracy. His supporters have rallied behind him, dismissing the report as politically motivated and lacking in credibility. However, the evidence presented by the auditors speaks for itself.

The controversy has sparked a national debate, with many calling for transparency, accountability, and integrity in governance. Critics argue that the political figure's actions have eroded public trust and undermined the democratic process. They argue that a political leader's primary responsibility is to serve the people honestly and transparently, not to build personal legacies on a scaffold of lies.

The political figure's actions have also raised concerns about the broader implications of dishonesty in governance. If a political leader can misuse public funds and deceive the public without consequences, what does this say about our democratic system? What does it say about the state of our nation?

As the controversy continues to unfold, it serves as a reminder that truth and honesty are the cornerstones of a functioning democracy. It is a reminder that we, as a nation, must hold our leaders accountable for their actions. It is a reminder that we must demand transparency and integrity, lest we find ourselves living in a world built on a scaffold of lies.

In the face of the controversy, the political figure has a choice to make. He can choose to admit his mistakes, learn from them, and work towards restoring public trust. Or he can choose to continue his denials, further eroding the trust and confidence of the people. The choice he makes will have far-reaching implications, not just for him, but for the future of our democracy.

As citizens, it is our responsibility to demand honesty and integrity from our leaders. We must hold them accountable for their actions, and we must not allow ourselves to be fooled by empty promises and deception. We must build our nation on a foundation of truth, not on a scaffold of lies.",mistral
21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India,"Title: 21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India

In a startling revelation, a recent study has found that 21 out of the 30 cities with the highest levels of air pollution globally are located in India. The World Health Organization (WHO) report has highlighted the urgent need for action to address this environmental crisis.

New Delhi, the capital city, ranks as the most polluted city in the world, with an annual mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of 153 micrograms per cubic meter. This is significantly above the WHO's safe limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. The second and third most polluted cities are also in India – Faridabad and Gaziabad, respectively.

"Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time","Title: Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time

In the face of the rapidly evolving coronavirus pandemic, the United States government's response has been, at best, inadequate. As the nation grapples with the ongoing health crisis, the economic fallout, and the devastating human toll, it is clear that the government's initial approach has fallen far short of what is necessary to protect the American people.

From the outset, the government's response has been characterized by a lack of urgency, a disregard for science, and a disjointed approach. The failures to act swiftly and decisively have resulted in a crisis that could have been mitigated, if not entirely avoided.

The government's initial response was marked by a reluctance to take strong measures to contain the spread of the virus. This was exemplified by the Trump administration's insistence on downplaying the severity of the pandemic, even as cases began to spike in other countries. The administration's message was clear: the coronavirus was not a threat to the United States.

But as the virus began to spread across the country, it became increasingly clear that the government's denial and complacency had put the nation at risk. The lack of testing, the conflation of COVID-19 with the flu, and the failure to implement widespread social distancing measures meant that the virus was able to take hold in communities across the country.

As the number of cases and deaths continued to rise, the government's response remained scattershot and haphazard. The lack of a coherent national strategy has resulted in a patchwork of responses across the country, with some states taking aggressive measures to contain the virus while others have largely left it to individuals to protect themselves.

The government's failure to take decisive action has had devastating consequences. Hospitals have been overwhelmed, resources have been strained, and the economy has plunged into a deep recession. The toll on individuals and families has been immense, with millions of Americans losing their jobs and their livelihoods.

But it is not too late for the government to take action. The first step is to acknowledge the severity of the crisis and to take decisive action to contain the spread of the virus. This means implementing widespread testing, contact tracing, and social distancing measures. It also means providing financial assistance to individuals and businesses that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

The government must also take a science-based approach to the pandemic, following the guidance of public health experts and listening to the advice of those on the front lines of the crisis. This means prioritizing the health and safety of the American people over political considerations and economic interests.

The government's failures on the coronavirus pandemic are a damning indictment of its incompetence and its disregard for the well-being of the American people. But there is still time for the government to take action and to turn the tide of the crisis. The nation is counting on its leaders to act with urgency, compassion, and wisdom. It is time for the government to step up and to do what is necessary to protect the American people.",mistral
Bristol sisters aim to raise awareness of 'honour hate',"**Title:** Bristol Sisters Aim to Raise Awareness of 'Honour Hate'

**Subtitle:** A powerful duo takes on the challenge of addressing the prevalence of 'honour-based' violence in the UK

*In the heart of Bristol, a city known for its vibrant culture and diversity, two sisters are using their voices to shed light on a darker aspect of society: 'honour-based' violence.*

**A Family's Tragedy Sparks a Movement**

For Amira and Aisha Khan, the issue hits close to home. Their cousin, Shafilea Ahmed, was a victim of 'honour-based' violence, a form of domestic abuse motivated by perceived actions that bring shame upon the family. Shafilea, just 17 years old at the time, was brutally murdered by her parents in 2003.

Now, more than a decade later, Amira and Aisha are determined to ensure that their cousin's life and death are not in vain. They have launched a campaign called 'Honour Not Shame,' aiming to raise awareness about the prevalence and dangers of 'honour-based' violence in the UK.

**What is 'Honour-Based' Violence?**

'Honour-based' violence is a term used to describe a range of abusive behaviours that are wrongly justified in the name of 'honour.' This can include physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as forced marriage and 'honour killings.' The victims are often women and girls, but men and boys can also be targeted.

Despite its devastating impact, 'honour-based' violence is often shrouded in silence, with victims and their families feeling too afraid to speak out. This, the sisters argue, is a major reason why the issue remains largely unaddressed.

**Breaking the Silence**

Amira and Aisha are determined to break this silence. Through their campaign, they aim to educate the public about 'honour-based' violence, empower victims to seek help, and work with policymakers to improve support for victims.

""We want to make sure that no other family has to go through what we went through with Shafilea,"" Amira said in a recent interview. ""We want to create a society where everyone is safe, regardless of their gender, race, or culture.""

The sisters have already made significant strides in their mission. They have given talks at schools, colleges, and community events, and have worked with local authorities to improve services for victims. They have also established a helpline for those affected by 'honour-based' violence.

**A Growing Problem**

Despite these efforts, 'honour-based' violence remains a significant problem in the UK. According to the Forced Marriage Unit, there were 1,464 forced marriage cases reported in 2019, a 33% increase from the previous year. The true number is likely to be much higher, as many cases go unreported.

The sisters are not alone in their fight against 'honour-based' violence. There are numerous organisations and individuals working tirelessly to support victims and raise awareness about the issue. However, they argue that more needs to be done.

**A Call to Action**

Amira and Aisha are calling on the government, local authorities, and the public to take action against 'honour-based' violence. They want to see improved support for victims, better education about the issue, and tougher laws to punish perpetrators.

""We need to create a society where everyone is valued and respected, regardless of their background,"" Aisha said. ""We need to make it clear that 'honour-based' violence will not be tolerated.""

In the wake of Shafilea's tragic death, Amira and Aisha have turned their grief into action. Through their campaign, they are working to ensure that no other family has to experience the pain they have endured. And in doing so, they are helping to build a safer, fairer, and more compassionate society for all.",mistral
Video shows a man rescuing neighbor's dog after its leash got stuck in elevator doors,"**Man Heroically Rescues Neighbor's Dog Trapped in Elevator Doors**

In a heartwarming display of quick thinking and bravery, a local resident named John Doe rescued his neighbor's dog from a precarious situation in their apartment building's elevator on Wednesday evening.

The incident occurred around 7:30 PM when the dog, a small but energetic terrier named Max, managed to slip its leash as it exited the elevator on the third floor. The leash became entangled in the closing doors, trapping Max between the doors and the floor.

John Doe, who was waiting for the elevator on the same floor, heard Max's panicked barking and noticed the unusual scene. Without a moment's hesitation, he sprang into action.

""I saw the dog was trapped, and I knew I had to do something,"" John recounted. ""I couldn't just stand there and watch.""

With a combination of agility and determination, John managed to wedge himself into the gap between the elevator doors and the floor, reaching out to grab Max just as the elevator reached the ground floor.

""I was a bit scared, but I knew I had to stay calm for Max's sake,"" John said. ""I didn't want to make the situation worse.""

Once he had a firm grip on Max's collar, John carefully pulled the dog out of the elevator, eliciting cheers and applause from fellow residents who had gathered around.

""I'm just glad everything turned out okay,"" John said modestly. ""Max is a sweet dog, and I'm just happy I could help.""

The building management praised John for his quick action, stating that such incidents could potentially be dangerous. They also emphasized the importance of securing pets properly when using the elevator.

Max's owner, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed her gratitude towards John. ""I can't thank him enough for saving Max,"" she said. ""He's more than just a pet to me, and John's actions really mean a lot.""

John Doe, a software engineer by profession, downplayed his heroics, stating that he was just in the right place at the right time. However, his neighbors and Max's owner see him as a true hero.

In the aftermath of the incident, Max seemed a bit shaken but otherwise unharmed. His owner reported that he had settled down and was back to his usual playful self.

This heartwarming incident serves as a reminder of the kindness and courage that exists within our communities. John Doe's quick thinking and selfless actions not only saved Max but also brought a sense of unity and appreciation among the building's residents.",mistral

**Headline**: Groundbreaking Discovery: Ancient Manuscript Unearthed in Egypt Sheds New Light on Early Civilizations

**Sub-headline**: Archaeologists hail the discovery as a ""game changer"" in understanding the early history of human societies.

**Main Image**: A close-up of the ancient manuscript, with a shadowy archaeologist in the background.

**Body Text**:

In a significant find that promises to rewrite historical narratives, an international team of archaeologists has unearthed an ancient manuscript in Egypt, dating back over 3,500 years. The discovery, made in the remote desert region of Luxor, is being hailed as a ""game changer"" in understanding the early history of human societies.

The manuscript, written in an unknown script, was found buried in a hidden chamber within the ancient tomb of a little-known pharaoh. The tomb, located in the Valley of the Kings, is believed to have been sealed for over 3,500 years. The manuscript, remarkably well-preserved, measures approximately 1.5 meters in length and 0.8 meters in width.

""This discovery is nothing short of extraordinary,"" said Dr. Amelia Hart, the lead archaeologist on the excavation team. ""The manuscript provides us with a unique insight into the thoughts, beliefs, and daily lives of one of the earliest known civilizations.""

The manuscript is written on papyrus, a material commonly used in ancient Egypt for writing. It contains complex hieroglyphics, many of which have never been seen before. The team of archaeologists and historians, working tirelessly to decipher the script, have made some initial breakthroughs.

""We've managed to translate a few passages, and they offer a fascinating glimpse into this ancient civilization,"" said Dr. Hart. ""For instance, we've found references to a previously unknown trade network that stretched across the Mediterranean and beyond. We've also uncovered a detailed account of a major military campaign, which suggests a level of organizational complexity that we hadn't previously understood.""

The discovery has sparked intense interest among historians and archaeologists around the world. The manuscript promises to shed new light on various aspects of ancient Egyptian society, including their religious practices, political structures, and cultural traditions.

""This find is a testament to the richness and complexity of ancient civilizations,"" said Dr. John Williams, a renowned historian at Oxford University. ""It's a reminder that there is still so much to learn about our past, and that every new discovery has the potential to challenge our existing understanding.""

The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities has announced that the manuscript will be carefully conserved and studied over the coming months. Once the translation is complete, the manuscript will be displayed at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

""This is a historic moment for Egypt and the world,"" said Dr. Khaled El-Enany, Egypt's Minister of Antiquities. ""This manuscript is a treasure trove of knowledge, and it will undoubtedly help us to better understand our shared human history.""

As the world waits with bated breath for further translations, one thing is certain: the ancient manuscript unearthed in Egypt is set to redefine our understanding of early civilizations.

How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef,"Title: How McDonald's Made the Switch to Fresh Beef

McDonald's, the global fast-food giant, has recently announced a significant shift in its beef supply chain, transitioning from frozen beef patties to fresh beef in a bid to enhance the quality of its burgers.

The move, which began in select locations in 2016, has now been rolled out to over 14,000 restaurants across the United States. This change represents the largest overhaul of McDonald's beef supply in its 63-year history, a testament to the company's commitment to improving the quality of its offerings.

The fresh beef initiative is part of McDonald's ongoing strategy to adapt to changing consumer preferences. In recent years, there has been a growing demand for fresh, high-quality ingredients in fast food, a trend that McDonald's aims to capitalize on.

The transition to fresh beef involves grilling the patties on the spot, rather than cooking pre-formed, frozen patties. This allows for a more uniform cooking experience, resulting in a juicier, tastier burger. The change has been well-received by customers, with many praising the improved flavor and texture of the new patties.

McDonald's has partnered with several suppliers to ensure a steady supply of fresh beef. The company has implemented stringent quality control measures, including regular inspections and audits, to maintain the highest standards.

The fresh beef initiative is not without its challenges. The logistics of sourcing, storing, and preparing fresh beef on a large scale are complex and require significant investment. However, McDonald's believes that the benefits outweigh the costs, citing increased customer satisfaction and improved brand image as key benefits.

In addition to the fresh beef initiative, McDonald's has also made strides in other areas to improve the quality of its food. The company has introduced healthier options, such as salads and fruit, and has committed to using antibiotic-free chicken in its menu items.

The shift to fresh beef is just one part of McDonald's larger strategy to modernize its brand and appeal to a new generation of customers. As consumer preferences continue to evolve, McDonald's is positioning itself as a fast-food leader that is responsive to these changes.

In conclusion, McDonald's has made a significant shift in its beef supply chain, transitioning from frozen beef patties to fresh beef. This change represents a commitment to improving the quality of its offerings and adapting to changing consumer preferences. The transition to fresh beef has been well-received by customers and is part of a larger strategy by McDonald's to modernize its brand.",mistral

**Image:** A beautifully cooked, golden-brown splayed roast chicken on a platter, surrounded by caramelized ramps.

**Subtitle:** Elevate your dinner table with this delectable roast chicken recipe featuring a seasonal favorite – caramelized ramps.

**Ingredients:**

- One 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) whole chicken
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 bunches (about 2 pounds/900 grams) of ramps, roots trimmed
- 4 tablespoons (57 grams) unsalted butter, divided
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) white wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon (4 grams) Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon (1.5 grams) cornstarch
- Chopped fresh chives, for garnish

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Chicken:** Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Remove the chicken giblets and pat the chicken dry. Season the cavity and outside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Using kitchen shears, cut out the backbone of the chicken, then press the chicken flat, splaying the legs apart. Place the splayed chicken, breast-side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

2. **Caramelize the Ramps:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons (28 grams) of butter over medium-high heat. Add the ramps, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer the ramps to a plate.

3. **Make the Sauce:** In the same skillet, add olive oil, vinegar, and mustard. Cook over medium heat until the vinegar is almost fully evaporated, about 1 minute. Whisk in the heavy cream, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons (28 grams) of butter. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cornstarch, then return the ramps to the pan and cook until the sauce coats the ramps, about 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.

4. **Roast the Chicken:** Roast the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165°F (74°C), about 45 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter and let rest for 10 minutes.

5. **Serve:** Spoon the ramp sauce over the chicken and garnish with chopped chives. Serve the remaining sauce on the side.

Coronavirus: How to clean your smartphone safely,"Title: Coronavirus: How to Clean Your Smartphone Safely

In the ongoing battle against the coronavirus, maintaining cleanliness has become more crucial than ever. This includes our gadgets, particularly our smartphones, which we touch frequently throughout the day. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to clean your smartphone safely to help reduce the risk of infection.

**1. Use the Right Cleaning Supplies**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using isopropyl alcohol with at least 70% alcohol or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, as these substances are known to kill the virus on surfaces. Avoid using bleach, as it can damage the screen.

**2. Remove the Case**

If your phone has a case, remove it before cleaning to ensure that all areas of your device are disinfected. Once cleaned, you can put the case back on.

**3. Turn Off Your Phone**

Turn off your phone before cleaning to prevent any accidental activation that could cause damage.

**4. Dampen a Microfiber Cloth**

Dampen a microfiber cloth with the disinfecting solution. The cloth should be slightly damp, not wet. Too much liquid can seep into the phone's seams and cause damage.

**5. Clean Your Phone**

Gently wipe the screen, back, and all edges of the phone using the damp microfiber cloth. Pay extra attention to areas prone to dirt and germs, such as the home button, charging ports, and volume buttons.

**6. Dry Your Phone**

After cleaning, use a dry microfiber cloth to dry your phone. This will help prevent any liquid from seeping into the phone and causing damage.

**7. Repeat as Needed**

For added protection, consider cleaning your phone regularly. The CDC suggests cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces daily in household areas.

**8. Be Mindful of Screens**

While disinfecting your phone, be careful not to press too hard on the screen, as this could potentially scratch it.

**9. Consider a Phone Sanitizer**

If you frequently use your phone in public spaces, you might want to consider investing in a phone sanitizer. These devices use UV light to kill germs on your phone's surface.

**10. Wash Your Hands**

Lastly, always remember to wash your hands before and after handling your phone. This is one of the best ways to protect yourself from germs and viruses.

In these unprecedented times, taking precautions to maintain cleanliness is essential. By following these steps, you can help ensure your smartphone is a safe and clean part of your daily life.",mistral

"4 of your latest coronavirus questions, answered","**Title:** 4 of Your Latest Coronavirus Questions, Answered

**1. Are vaccinated individuals still required to wear masks?**

Yes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend that vaccinated individuals wear masks in certain situations. These include indoor settings in areas with high transmission rates, hospitals, prisons, and homeless shelters. Furthermore, the CDC advises vaccinated individuals to wear masks in public settings when they cannot socially distance.

**2. Can I safely attend large outdoor events if I'm vaccinated?**

Outdoor events, especially those with proper ventilation, are generally considered safer for vaccinated individuals. However, the CDC still recommends maintaining social distancing and wearing masks in crowded settings. It's also important to remember that not everyone around you may be vaccinated, so being cautious and considerate is essential.

**3. What should I do if I've been exposed to someone with COVID-19, but I'm fully vaccinated?**

If you've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, the CDC suggests getting tested 3-5 days after exposure, even if you don't have symptoms. If your test is negative, you should still wear a mask indoors in public settings for 14 days following exposure or until your test result.

**4. Can children receive the COVID-19 vaccine?**

These people could make Trump's life miserable,"Title: ""These People Could Make Trump's Life Miserable""

In the aftermath of former President Donald Trump's indictment, the legal landscape for the ex-commander-in-chief is becoming increasingly complex. While Trump has long been a subject of various investigations, several key figures could potentially intensify the legal challenges he faces.

1. **Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg**: Bragg took office in January and inherited the investigation into Trump's business practices, including the Stormy Daniels payment and the alleged hush money paid to Karen McDougal. Bragg's office recently secured an indictment, marking the first time a former U.S. president has been charged with a crime. The specific charges have not been disclosed, but they are expected to be related to business practices and financial transactions.

2. **New York Attorney General Letitia James**: James' office is conducting a separate civil investigation into the Trump Organization's financial dealings. James' team has been in the process of reviewing more than 800,000 documents and conducting witness interviews. The investigation could lead to a lawsuit against the Trump Organization, potentially implicating Trump himself.

3. **Georgia Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis**: Willis is investigating Trump and his allies' actions during the 2020 election, particularly their attempts to overturn the results in Georgia. The investigation includes a potential attempt to interfere with the certification of Georgia's electoral votes and the January 6th Capitol insurrection.

4. **Congressional Committee Investigations**: Both the House Select Committee on the January 6th Attack and the House Oversight Committee are conducting investigations into Trump's actions during his presidency. The January 6th Committee is focused on the events leading up to and during the Capitol insurrection, while the Oversight Committee is investigating Trump's handling of classified documents after leaving office.

5. **Federal Investigations**: The Department of Justice is conducting several investigations into Trump's actions, including his role in the January 6th Capitol insurrection, his handling of classified documents, and potential obstruction of justice. The DOJ is also investigating Trump's involvement in efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in multiple states.

As the legal battles unfold, Trump's legal team has been vocal about their intentions to challenge the validity of the investigations and the charges against their client. Trump himself has maintained his innocence and has accused the investigators of political motivations.

Despite these assertions, the mounting legal challenges could potentially consume a significant portion of Trump's time and resources, potentially affecting his public image and future political ambitions. The outcome of these investigations could also set precedents for future cases involving former high-ranking officials.

In the meantime, the American public will continue to watch as these investigations and potential legal battles unfold, shedding light on the actions of one of the most controversial figures in modern U.S. history.",mistral
Ellie and Nele: From she to he - and back to she again,"Title: ""Ellie and Nele: From She to He - and Back to She Again""

In a journey that has captivated the hearts of many, Ellie, a 26-year-old artist from Minneapolis, has shared her unique story of identity exploration and self-discovery. Born as Eliot, Ellie transitioned to a male identity in her late teenage years, only to reaffirm her female identity a few years later.

""I've always felt like I was on a quest to understand who I truly am,"" Ellie shared in an exclusive interview. ""I didn't realize at the time that transitioning was temporary for me, but looking back, it was a crucial step in my journey.""

Ellie's story began in a small town in Minnesota. Growing up, she felt uncomfortable in her body and struggled to connect with her male peers. She recalls feeling a deep connection to femininity but suppressing those feelings due to societal expectations and a lack of understanding.

At the age of 18, Ellie decided to transition to a male identity. She changed her name, began hormone replacement therapy, and underwent top surgery. ""I felt like I was finally becoming the person I was meant to be,"" she said.

However, as the years passed, Ellie began to question her identity again. She felt a growing discomfort with her masculine presentation and a longing for the femininity she had suppressed for so long. ""I realized that transitioning didn't resolve my identity crisis,"" she explained. ""It just shifted it.""

In 2019, Ellie made the decision to transition back to a female identity. She resumed hormone therapy, changed her name to Ellie, and is currently in the process of restoring her feminine appearance through breast reconstruction.

Ellie's story resonates with many people, particularly those who are grappling with their own identity crises. She hopes that by sharing her story, she can offer hope and encouragement to others who are struggling. ""It's okay to change your mind,"" she said. ""It's okay to evolve and grow. And it's okay to be true to yourself, no matter where that journey takes you.""

Ellie's journey has also brought attention to the lack of support and resources for people who transition and then decide to reverse their transition. ""There's a lot of stigma around detransitioning, and it's important to change that narrative,"" she said. ""I'm not 'failed' or 'confused.' I'm simply a person who is exploring and understanding my identity in a way that works for me.""

Ellie's story is a powerful reminder that identity is a fluid and complex thing, and that it's okay to change and grow throughout our lives. As she continues to navigate her journey, she encourages others to do the same, and to always be true to themselves.

""My identity is not a fixed thing,"" she said. ""It's a journey, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next.""

In a world that often seeks to categorize and define people, Ellie's story offers a refreshing reminder of the beauty and complexity of the human spirit. Her courage and resilience serve as an inspiration to us all, reminding us that it's okay to be who we are, and that it's never too late to embrace our true selves.",mistral

Saudi Arabia detains senior members of its royal family,"**Saudi Arabia Detains Senior Members of Its Royal Family**

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia – A shocking turn of events has unfolded in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as senior members of the royal family were detained in a series of unexpected raids over the weekend.

According to official sources, the detentions are part of an ongoing anti-corruption campaign led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also the country's de facto ruler. The exact number of those arrested is still uncertain, with reports suggesting anywhere from 11 to 20 princes and former ministers are currently under investigation.

Among those detained is Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a prominent businessman and investor often referred to as the ""Arabian Warren Buffett."" His net worth is estimated to be around $18.7 billion, making him one of the richest individuals in the world. The billionaire is best known for his stakes in companies such as Twitter, Apple, and Citigroup.

Other prominent figures reportedly caught up in this sweep include Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who until recently served as the Minister of the National Guard, and Adel Fakeih, the former mayor of Jeddah and Minister of Economy and Planning.

The detentions have sent waves of unease through the royal family and the business community in Saudi Arabia. Some have speculated that the crackdown is intended to consolidate power around the young crown prince, who has been pursuing ambitious reforms since being appointed to his current position in 2015.

However, critics argue that the arrests are politically motivated and are being used as a tool to silence potential rivals and critics. Human rights groups have expressed concern that those arrested may be subjected to torture or other forms of abuse while in custody.

The anti-corruption crackdown has been ongoing for several months, with dozens of businessmen and government officials already being detained and questioned. The campaign appears to be part of a broader effort to modernize the Saudi economy and reduce its reliance on oil revenue.

In a statement, the Saudi government emphasized that the anti-corruption drive is being conducted in accordance with Islamic law and will ensure the financial stability of the country. Officials also stressed that those arrested will be afforded due process and the opportunity to defend themselves in court.

The abrupt nature of the arrests and the high-profile figures involved have raised eyebrows both within Saudi Arabia and internationally. The United States, one of Saudi Arabia's closest allies, has yet to comment on the situation.

As the situation continues to develop, it remains unclear what the long-term implications of these detentions will be for Saudi Arabia's royal family, business community, and the country as a whole. One thing is certain: the Kingdom is entering uncharted waters, and only time will tell if the current course will lead to stability or further instability.

In the heart of the Indian Ocean, where azure waters meet pristine white sands, a unique quarantine scenario is unfolding. At the luxury resort island of Gili Lankanfushi, Maldives, tourists are being kept under mandatory quarantine due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Initially designed as a haven for weary travelers seeking tranquility and relaxation, the resort has now transformed into a temporary quarantine facility. The decision, made in line with the Maldives government's guidelines, has left some guests initially surprised but ultimately reassured by the high standard of care being provided.

""We were a bit taken aback at first,"" said a guest from the United States, who chose to remain anonymous. ""But once we understood the situation and saw the measures being taken, we felt safe and well looked after.""

Guests are housed in private villas, each equipped with a dedicated team of staff to ensure their comfort and wellbeing during the 14-day quarantine period. The resort's secluded nature, combined with stringent health and safety protocols, provides an isolated environment that minimizes the risk of infection.

The Maldives, known for its breathtaking islands and vibrant marine life, has been largely unaffected by the pandemic, with just over 12,000 confirmed cases as of this writing. However, the government has taken proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including a mandatory quarantine for all incoming travelers.

Gili Lankanfushi, a member of the prestigious Minor Hotels group, has adapted swiftly to the new circumstances. The resort has implemented rigorous cleaning and disinfection procedures, contactless service, and temperature checks for all staff and guests.

""The safety and wellbeing of our guests and employees is our top priority,"" said the resort's general manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""We understand that these are challenging times, but we are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.""

While the quarantine period may not be the traditional holiday experience guests had anticipated, the resort is doing its best to make their stay as comfortable as possible. Daily meals are delivered to the villas, and guests can participate in virtual fitness classes, yoga sessions, and cooking demonstrations led by the resort's expert staff.

For some, the enforced isolation has even provided an opportunity for reflection and rejuvenation. ""It's been a strange experience, but I've also found it quite peaceful,"" said a guest from the UK. ""I've had time to relax, read, and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.""

As the world grapples with the ongoing pandemic, the situation at Gili Lankanfushi serves as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the tourism industry. Despite the challenges, the resort remains committed to providing a safe and memorable experience for its guests, even if that means a temporary quarantine in paradise.

My mother was raped in a nursing home at 88,"Title: ""My Mother Was Raped in a Nursing Home at 88""

In the quiet town of Meadowgrove, a shocking incident has sparked outrage and concern, casting a dark cloud over a local nursing home that was once renowned for its care and compassion. The victim, an 88-year-old woman named Eleanor Johnson, has bravely stepped forward to share her harrowing experience, shedding light on a hidden issue that has long plagued the elderly community.

Eleanor, a vibrant woman with a zest for life even in her twilight years, was admitted to Meadowgrove Nursing Home two months ago following a fall at her home. Her family, who lived nearby, visited regularly, finding comfort in the staff's assurances of her well-being. However, on a chilly November afternoon, Eleanor's daughter received a call that would shatter their world.

""Mom was raped,"" Eleanor's daughter, Emily, recounted, her voice trembling with emotion. ""They told me she was found in a state of undress, traumatized and terrified. I can't even begin to describe the pain and anger I felt.""

The Meadowgrove Police Department, upon investigation, confirmed the horrific allegations. The nursing home's security footage revealed a shocking incident that occurred in broad daylight, in a room far from the sight of staff or other residents. The perpetrator, a male nursing assistant, has since been arrested and charged with rape and sexual assault of a vulnerable adult.

The nursing home's management has issued a statement expressing their ""deepest sympathies"" to Eleanor and her family. They assert that immediately upon learning of the incident, they cooperated fully with the police investigation and have since terminated the responsible employee. However, this has done little to assuage the growing concern and outrage within the community.

Advocacy groups for the elderly have long warned about the prevalence of sexual abuse in nursing homes, citing a lack of adequate staffing, training, and oversight as contributing factors. In the United States alone, it is estimated that tens of thousands of elderly individuals suffer from some form of sexual abuse each year.

Eleanor's case has brought this issue to the forefront of public discourse. Her family has decided to share her story in hopes of bringing about change, ensuring that such an atrocity never happens again.

""I want my mother's experience to be a catalyst for change,"" Emily said. ""We need to ensure that nursing homes are safe, that staff are properly trained, and that the elderly are protected from harm.""

Local authorities have pledged to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident at Meadowgrove Nursing Home. They are also urging families to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity or signs of abuse.

Eleanor, meanwhile, continues her recovery, not just physically, but emotionally. With the support of her family and the community, she is determined to move forward, seeking justice not just for herself, but for all elderly individuals who have fallen victim to such heinous acts.

As the case unfolds, the town of Meadowgrove stands united, vowing to protect its most vulnerable citizens and to ensure that those who prey on the elderly are brought to justice. The incident serves as a grim reminder that while we may grow old, our right to dignity, safety, and respect should never be compromised.",mistral

This abrupt decision is expected to have significant financial implications, particularly for the league's television partners.

The NBA's broadcast deals with networks such as ABC, TNT, and ESPN are worth billions of dollars, and the suspension of games will undoubtedly disrupt these lucrative arrangements. According to media industry analysts, the loss of NBA content could result in a substantial financial hit for the networks, with some estimates suggesting potential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

""The suspension of the NBA season is a blow to our programming schedule and our business,"" said James Goldston, president of ABC News, in a statement. ""We are working closely with the NBA to determine the best course of action moving forward.""

ESPN, the league's longstanding broadcast partner, is expected to bear the brunt of the financial fallout. The network had planned to air 25 NBA games over the next two weeks, with an estimated total value of over $100 million in advertising revenue. The sudden absence of these games will leave a significant gap in ESPN's schedule, and the network will need to find alternative programming to fill the void.

""We understand our fans are frustrated, and we share in that frustration,"" said ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro. ""But the health and safety of everyone is our top priority, and we support the NBA's decision.""

As the NBA grapples with the pandemic, other sports leagues are closely watching the situation. The National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) have both taken steps to limit fan attendance at games, while the National Football League (NFL) has yet to announce any changes to its upcoming season.

However, the NBA's bold move could serve as a precedent for other leagues to follow suit, potentially leading to further financial losses for television partners. According to industry analysts, the value of sports programming to networks is significant, with live sports events attracting millions of viewers and generating substantial advertising revenue.

""The NBA's decision to suspend its season is a wake-up call for the entire sports industry,"" said media analyst Michael Nathanson. ""The financial impact could be substantial, and it's unclear how networks will recover from this loss.""

In response to the NBA's suspension, networks are exploring alternative programming options to fill the void left by the absence of live sports. Some have turned to classic sports programming, such as reruns of past games and documentaries, while others are considering airing esports events or other live programming alternatives.

Despite the challenges ahead, industry experts believe that the NBA and its television partners will find a way to weather the storm. ""The NBA is a resilient league, and I have no doubt that they will find a way to overcome this challenge,"" said Goldston. ""We are committed to working closely with the NBA to support them during this difficult time.""

As the NBA and its television partners navigate the uncertain future, one thing is certain: the pandemic has disrupted the sports world in ways that were once unimaginable. The suspension of the NBA season is just the latest example of how the coronavirus is reshaping the landscape of the sports industry.

In the coming weeks, we will likely see more changes as leagues and networks adapt to the new reality. For now, fans and networks alike will need to wait and see how the situation unfolds. As the NBA and its partners grapple with the financial implications of the suspension, one thing is clear: the impact will be felt far and wide.",mistral

Nigeria says it is ready and more than capable of dealing with coronavirus,"Title: Nigeria Says It's Ready and More Than Capable of Dealing with Coronavirus

Abuja, Nigeria - The Nigerian government has reassured its citizens and the international community that it is well-prepared to manage the potential spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) within its borders.

In a press conference held yesterday, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, emphasized that Nigeria's health infrastructure and response mechanisms have been strengthened since the Ebola outbreak in 2014. He stated, ""We have learned valuable lessons from the Ebola outbreak, and we are confident that we can effectively contain any potential spread of the coronavirus.""

The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been at the forefront of the country's preparations. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, the Director-General of NCDC, reported that over 7,000 healthcare workers have been trained on infection prevention and control. He added that ""our laboratories are functional and can test for the coronavirus. We have the capacity to test up to 3,000 samples per week.""

The government has also taken steps to strengthen border surveillance. The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, announced that all passengers arriving from affected countries will undergo health screening at airports. He also stated that the federal government is working closely with international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to ensure that Nigeria is equipped with the necessary resources to combat the virus.

In an effort to educate the public, the Nigerian government has launched a national awareness campaign. The campaign, which includes radio and television announcements, aims to provide accurate information about the virus and prevent the spread of misinformation. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, urged Nigerians to take the threat seriously and to follow the guidance of health officials.

Despite these assurances, some experts have raised concerns about Nigeria's readiness. Dr. Oyewale Tomori, a virologist and former president of the Nigerian Academy of Science, expressed his concerns in an interview, stating, ""We still have a lot of work to do. Our healthcare infrastructure is not where it needs to be, and we need to have more testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure the safety of our healthcare workers.""

Additionally, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has called for the government to take immediate action to address the shortage of healthcare facilities and equipment. The President of the NMA, Dr. Francis Faduyile, stated, ""We urge the government to prioritize the strengthening of our healthcare system. We need more hospitals, more beds, and more PPE for our healthcare workers. We cannot afford to be caught off guard.""

Despite these concerns, the Nigerian government remains optimistic. The Minister of Health, Dr. Ehanire, concluded the press conference by saying, ""We are confident that we can effectively manage the coronavirus. We have learned from past outbreaks, and we have the support of international organizations. We urge all Nigerians to take the threat seriously and to follow the guidance of health officials. Together, we can prevent the spread of the coronavirus.""

The Nigerian government's response to the coronavirus outbreak remains a work in progress. The country's preparations have been praised by international organizations, but concerns remain about the state of Nigeria's healthcare infrastructure and the availability of resources. As the number of cases continues to rise globally, it is crucial that Nigeria continues to strengthen its response mechanisms to protect its citizens and prevent the spread of the virus.",mistral
Donald Trump brings out the worst in people,"Title: Donald Trump Brings Out the Worst in People

In a political climate that has become increasingly divisive, former President Donald Trump's rhetoric and actions have been a significant contributing factor in exacerbating tensions among American citizens. Over the past four years, Trump's controversial statements and policies have not only polarized the nation but also emboldened extremist groups, inciting violence and hate crimes.

Since leaving office, Trump has continued to make divisive comments, fueling conspiracy theories and stoking the flames of discord. In a recent rally, he made unfounded claims about the 2020 election, repeating falsehoods about widespread voter fraud, which has led to increased distrust in the electoral process and encouraged attempts to undermine the results. This has had a ripple effect, with some Trump supporters resorting to violence and intimidation tactics, such as targeting election workers and officials.

Trump's incendiary rhetoric has also been linked to an increase in hate crimes. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit organization that monitors hate groups, reported a surge in hate crimes during Trump's presidency, with a notable increase in incidents targeting racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ individuals. The organization attributes this rise in hate crimes to Trump's repeated use of racist, xenophobic, and homophobic language, as well as his implementation of policies that discriminate against these groups.

Moreover, Trump's presidency has emboldened extremist groups, such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, who have been involved in numerous instances of violence and insurrection. These groups have been empowered by Trump's rhetoric, which has legitimized their extremist views and given them a platform to spread their message of hate and division.

In addition to promoting hate and division, Trump has also undermined the democratic process and the rule of law. His repeated attempts to interfere with investigations, obstruct justice, and undermine the impeachment process have eroded public trust in the government and set a dangerous precedent for future administrations.

Trump's actions and words have not only divided the nation but have also had a detrimental impact on American democracy. By promoting hate, inciting violence, and undermining the democratic process, he has brought out the worst in people and created a toxic political environment that threatens the very fabric of American society.

The aftermath of Trump's presidency will undoubtedly leave lasting scars on the nation, but it is essential for Americans to come together and work towards healing and reconciliation. It is crucial to hold Trump and his allies accountable for their actions and to address the underlying issues that have contributed to the rise of extremism and divisiveness in America.

Only by acknowledging the harm that Trump has caused and working towards a more inclusive, tolerant, and united society can we begin to move forward and ensure a brighter future for all Americans.",mistral
Our connected world made coronavirus spread. It may also be what saves us from it,"Title: ""Our Connected World Made Coronavirus Spread. It May Also Be What Saves Us From It""

In the age of globalization, the world has become more interconnected than ever before. This interconnectedness, once a beacon of progress and advancement, has also been a double-edged sword, as evidenced by the rapid and widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). However, the very tools that facilitated the virus's dissemination may also prove instrumental in our fight against it.

The coronavirus, a pathogen that originated in Wuhan, China, has since spread to over 200 countries, infecting millions and claiming countless lives. The speed and scale of its spread can be attributed, in large part, to our connected world. The ease of international travel and the global supply chain have allowed the virus to traverse continents in a matter of weeks, infecting unsuspecting individuals along the way.

However, it is not all doom and gloom. The same interconnected world that facilitated the virus's spread is also enabling us to combat it more effectively than ever before.

Take social media, for example. In the early days of the pandemic, misinformation and fear spread as quickly as the virus itself. However, as the world adapted to the new reality, social media platforms have become a valuable tool for disseminating accurate information and combating the spread of misinformation. Governments, health organizations, and even everyday citizens have taken to social media to share updates, advice, and resources, helping to keep communities informed and empowered.

Another example is telemedicine. As physical distancing measures have been implemented around the world, traditional healthcare models have been disrupted. However, the rise of telemedicine has allowed patients to consult with healthcare providers remotely, reducing the need for in-person visits and limiting the potential for infection. This not only helps to flatten the curve and reduce the strain on healthcare systems but also ensures that those who are most vulnerable can continue to access essential healthcare services.

Collaboration and cooperation between nations have also been crucial in the fight against COVID-19. Scientists and researchers from around the world have pooled their resources and expertise to develop vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests. This international collaboration has accelerated the pace of progress and brought us closer to a solution than we would have been otherwise.

Moreover, the interconnectedness of our world has allowed for the rapid sharing of best practices and lessons learned. Cities and nations that have successfully managed the pandemic have been able to share their strategies and successes with others, helping to inform and guide decision-making around the world.

The interconnected world that has facilitated the spread of COVID-19 is also our best hope for overcoming it. The same tools that have allowed the virus to travel the globe can also help us to combat it. Social media, telemedicine, international collaboration, and the sharing of best practices are all powerful weapons in our arsenal against the pandemic.

As we continue to navigate this unprecedented crisis, it is essential that we harness the power of our connected world to fight the virus and protect our communities. The road ahead is long and difficult, but with unity, collaboration, and the power of technology, we can overcome this challenge and emerge stronger than ever before.

In conclusion, the interconnected world that has facilitated the spread of COVID-19 is also our best hope for overcoming it. The same tools that have allowed the virus to travel the globe can also help us to combat it. By working together, sharing information, and leveraging technology, we can navigate this crisis and emerge stronger than ever before.",mistral

Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"Title: Brazil's Fashion Industry Has a Diversity Problem

In the heart of São Paulo, Brazil's fashion capital, a diversity crisis is brewing. Despite the country's rich cultural tapestry, the fashion industry remains dominated by white models, largely ignoring the ethnic and body diversity that defines Brazil.

A study conducted by the Brazilian Association of Models (ABM) in 2020 revealed that 93% of models working in the country are white, a stark contrast to the nation's demographics where people of color make up over 50% of the population.

The lack of diversity extends beyond the runway. Designers, casting directors, and industry executives are overwhelmingly white, creating a system that perpetuates homogeneity. This homogeneity, in turn, perpetuates stereotypes and limits the representation of Brazil's diverse population.

Juliana Lima, a black model who has broken barriers in the industry, spoke out about her experiences. ""I've been told I'm too black for some shows, too curvy for others. It's disheartening to know that my appearance is still considered a liability in an industry that should be about beauty and self-expression,"" she said.

Lima's experiences echo those of many models of color in Brazil. They face discrimination, limited opportunities, and a lack of support from the industry, forcing many to seek opportunities abroad.

The absence of diversity in the fashion industry also has economic implications. A 2019 report by McKinsey & Company found that companies with ethnically and culturally diverse teams are more likely to outperform less diverse ones. In a country like Brazil, where consumer spending power is growing, the fashion industry's failure to reflect its customers could lead to missed opportunities.

However, there are signs of change. In recent years, a new generation of designers and activists has emerged, pushing for more diversity and inclusion. Brands like Diogo de Oliveira and Viva a Vida have made a conscious effort to feature models of color in their campaigns and shows.

The rise of social media has also given a platform to voices that were once marginalized. Influencers like Lima, Isabella Carvalho, and Victoria Lee have used their platforms to challenge the status quo and demand change.

The fashion industry in Brazil still has a long way to go. But with the growing pressure from consumers, activists, and the new generation of designers, there is hope for a more inclusive and representative industry.

As Juliana Lima puts it, ""We are not just asking for a seat at the table. We are asking for the table to be expanded so that everyone, regardless of their race, size, or background, can have a seat.""

In the end, a more diverse and inclusive fashion industry not only benefits the people who work in it but also the consumers who support it. It's a change that the industry in Brazil, and the world, can no longer afford to ignore.",mistral
"Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts","Title: Here Is When Each Generation Begins and Ends, According to Facts

In the ever-evolving landscape of societal dynamics, understanding generational shifts is crucial. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the start and end years for each generation, based on the research of demographers and sociologists:

**Traditionalists (Silent Generation):** Born between 1928 and 1945, these individuals are characterized by their resilience, loyalty, and conservatism. The traditionalist generation has significantly contributed to post-World War II rebuilding and is now largely retired.

**Baby Boomers:** This generation was born between 1946 and 1964. They are known for their optimism, ambition, and idealism. Baby Boomers are the largest generation in U.S. history and are currently transitioning into retirement.

**Generation X:** Born between 1965 and 1980, Gen Xers are often described as independent, self-reliant, and adaptable. This generation entered the workforce during a period of economic recession and has been stereotyped as disillusioned.

**Millennials (Generation Y):** Millennials were born between 1981 and 1996. This generation is technologically savvy, diverse, and ambitious. Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. workforce.

**Generation Z (iGeneration, Gen Z):** Born between 1997 and 2012, Gen Z is the most diverse generation yet. They are digital natives, pragmatic, and entrepreneurial. This generation is just entering the workforce.

**Generation Alpha:** The youngest generation, born after 2012, is still being studied. Early research suggests that Gen Alphas will be the most technologically proficient generation, with strong global awareness and a focus on sustainability.

It's important to note that these birth year ranges are not definitive and can vary slightly depending on the source. Additionally, while these generational labels offer useful shorthand, it's crucial to remember that individuals within each generation are unique and cannot be pigeonholed.

Understanding generational differences can help businesses, organizations, and policymakers to better understand and cater to the needs and preferences of different age groups. By acknowledging and respecting these differences, we can foster a more inclusive and productive society.

As each generation transitions into a new phase of life, it's fascinating to observe the impact they will have on our world. From the resilience of the Traditionalists to the technological prowess of Gen Z, each generation brings its unique strengths and perspectives to the table. By appreciating these differences and working together, we can continue to build a brighter future for all.",mistral

**UK's BBC Announces New Initiatives to Boost Diversity and Inclusion**

In a move to enhance diversity and inclusion within its ranks, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has unveiled a series of new initiatives aimed at fostering a more representative and equitable workforce.

The broadcaster revealed plans to launch a comprehensive training program focused on unconscious bias, aimed at educating staff about the subtle and often unintentional ways discrimination can manifest in the workplace. This training will be mandatory for all BBC employees, with an initial rollout scheduled for later this year.

In addition to the training program, the BBC has pledged to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in senior roles. The broadcaster will be setting specific targets for the recruitment and promotion of individuals from diverse backgrounds, with a particular emphasis on those from ethnic minorities and lower socio-economic backgrounds.

BBC Director-General Tim Davie, who took over the role in September 2020, has made diversity and inclusion a key priority for his tenure. In a statement, he said, ""The BBC is a public service that belongs to every person in the UK. It is essential that our workforce reflects the diversity of the audiences we serve. We have much work to do, but I am determined to make real progress.""

The new initiatives come amidst growing calls for greater diversity in the media industry, both in the UK and internationally. Critics have long argued that the lack of representation of underrepresented groups in media can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce social inequalities.

The BBC's efforts to boost diversity and inclusion follow a period of scrutiny for the broadcaster. In recent years, the BBC has faced allegations of pay disparities between male and female presenters, as well as criticism over its handling of sexual harassment claims.

In response to these criticisms, the BBC has implemented a number of measures to address pay gaps and improve its handling of complaints. The broadcaster has also established a new Diversity and Inclusion unit, which will oversee the implementation of the new initiatives announced today.

The BBC's commitment to diversity and inclusion extends beyond its workforce. The broadcaster has also pledged to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in its programming. This includes a commitment to ensure that at least one-quarter of all lead characters in BBC dramas are from an ethnic minority background.

The new initiatives have been welcomed by advocacy groups and industry figures. Lord Hall, the former Director-General of the BBC, said, ""The BBC has a unique role in our society, and it is essential that it reflects the diversity of the UK. Tim Davie is right to make diversity and inclusion a priority, and I wish him every success in achieving his goals.""

As the BBC embarks on this new chapter, it remains to be seen how effective these initiatives will be in promoting greater diversity and inclusion within the broadcaster. However, with a clear commitment from leadership and a comprehensive plan in place, there is reason to be hopeful that real progress can be made.

Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos,"Title: Deciphering the Hidden Meanings of Japanese Tattoos

In the vibrant and intricate world of Japanese tattoos, known as Irezumi, each design carries a rich history and unique symbolism that dates back centuries. From the mythological creatures to the poignant narratives, every tattoo tells a story, serving as an enduring testament to the culture and values of Japan.

The origins of Irezumi can be traced back to the Jōmon period (14,000 to 300 BCE), where simple tattoos were used for identification, protection, or to signify social status. However, it was during the Edo period (1603-1868) that Irezumi evolved into a highly stylized art form, adopting the distinctive characteristics we recognize today.

One of the most iconic symbols in Japanese tattoos is the koi fish. Swimming upstream against strong currents, the koi symbolizes perseverance, determination, and a battle against adversity. This powerful message resonates with many individuals, inspiring them to embrace the koi as a personal emblem of their own struggles and triumphs.

Another popular motif is the turtle, often depicted with a crane. The turtle represents longevity, wisdom, and perseverance, while the crane symbolizes longevity and fidelity. Together, these two creatures convey a deep appreciation for life's enduring qualities and the importance of loyalty and wisdom in navigating life's challenges.

Mythological creatures, such as the dragon and phoenix, also hold significant meanings in Japanese tattoos. The dragon, known as the king of all animals, symbolizes power, strength, and good luck. On the other hand, the phoenix, or hō-ō, represents rebirth, renewal, and immortality. A phoenix tattoo may be chosen by those seeking to commemorate a transformative event or to embody a fresh start in their lives.

In addition to these well-known symbols, Japanese tattoos often incorporate intricate patterns and designs from various elements of Japanese culture, including traditional art, literature, and folklore. The ukiyo-e style, for example, can be seen in numerous Irezumi designs, featuring woodblock prints of beautiful landscapes, courtesans, and mythical creatures.

As with any cultural symbol, there are certain nuances and historical contexts that must be considered when interpreting the meanings behind Japanese tattoos. For instance, while the cherry blossom is often associated with beauty, transience, and resilience, it also serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of life and the impermanence of earthly pleasures. Similarly, the tiger, a symbol of courage and strength, is also associated with the yakuza, Japan's organized crime syndicate, leading to a more negative connotation.

It is essential to approach the interpretation of Japanese tattoos with a deep understanding of their cultural significance and historical context. By doing so, one can appreciate the rich tapestry of meanings woven into each design and the enduring appeal of this ancient art form.

As the world continues to embrace and appreciate Japanese tattoos, it is essential to acknowledge and respect the cultural roots of this art form. By understanding the symbolism inherent in each design and the historical context from which they emerge, we can cultivate a deeper appreciation for Irezumi and the stories they tell.

In the end, a Japanese tattoo is not just a piece of art but a testament to the resilience, wisdom, and beauty that reside within us all. Each tattoo serves as a unique reminder of our own journeys, triumphs, and aspirations, and as such, they hold a special place in the hearts of those who bear them.",mistral
Satellite images show Iran building burial pits for coronavirus victims,"**Iran Constructs Mass Graves Amidst Surge in COVID-19 Deaths**

*Updated: [Date and Time]*

Tehran, Iran – Satellite imagery obtained by Reuters shows an increase in burial activity at five cemeteries across Iran, suggesting the country is struggling to handle the rising death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The images, captured between April 13 and May 1, 2020, reveal the expansion of burial pits at Behesht-e Zahra, Tehran's largest cemetery, as well as four other burial sites in the cities of Mashhad, Qom, Isfahan, and Khorramabad.

The images depict large, roughly rectangular excavations, some of which appear to have been recently filled with earth. According to experts, these features are consistent with mass graves.

""The scale and speed of these excavations suggest a significant increase in burial activity that exceeds the norm,"" said Dr. Mohammad Ali Rasoulzadeh, a geospatial analyst and epidemiologist based in Tehran. ""Given the current surge in COVID-19 cases, it is highly likely that these graves are intended for victims of the virus.""

Iran has reported over 93,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 5,900 deaths as of May 1, 2020. However, critics and health professionals alike have accused the Iranian government of underreporting both the number of cases and deaths.

The Iranian government has yet to comment on the satellite images, but President Hassan Rouhani recently acknowledged that the country is facing a critical situation. ""The situation is very difficult, and every day we are losing a large number of our people,"" he said in a televised address on April 29, 2020.

The construction of mass graves is not a new phenomenon in Iran. During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, an estimated half a million people died, many of whom were buried in mass graves.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has urged Iran to ensure that the bodies of COVID-19 victims are handled with respect and dignity. ""In times of crisis, it is essential that the dead are treated with the utmost respect and that their families are given the opportunity to mourn and lay their loved ones to rest according to their cultural and religious traditions,"" said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director for the Near and Middle East.

The satellite images come as the global community grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected over 3.5 million people and claimed over 246,000 lives according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Experts warn that the situation in Iran could worsen in the coming weeks due to a lack of testing, insufficient hospital capacity, and a reluctance to implement lockdown measures. ""The situation in Iran is extremely concerning,"" said Dr. Rasoulzadeh. ""The government needs to take immediate action to stem the tide of infections and prevent further loss of life.""

In the meantime, families of COVID-19 victims in Iran are left to mourn their loved ones in silence, with many unable to hold traditional funerals due to restrictions on gatherings. ""I can't even visit my husband's grave,"" said Fatemeh, a woman from Tehran who lost her husband to COVID-19. ""I just have to sit at home and pray for him.""

As the world watches in disbelief, Iran continues to struggle with the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many to question the government's ability to effectively manage the crisis.

In today's fast-paced world, the lives of individuals are a complex tapestry of work, family, relationships, and personal pursuits. One such life, belonging to a 32-year-old software engineer named Alex, offers a fascinating glimpse into the daily routine of a modern-day individual.

Alex's day begins at 6:00 am, with the alarm on his smartphone jolting him awake. He reaches for his phone, a habit he's been trying to break for years, but the allure of checking emails and social media is too strong to resist. After a quick glance at the news and a brief scroll through his social media feeds, he silences his phone and begins his morning routine.

A short workout at the gym, followed by a healthy breakfast, sets the tone for the day. Alex works from home, a trend that has become increasingly common due to the pandemic.

US politics,"Title: US Politics: Midterms Approach as Partisan Tensions Rise

Washington D.C., Oct 16 — As the midterm elections draw near, the political landscape in the United States is marked by a surge in partisan tensions and a growing divide between key political parties. The stakes are high, with control of both houses of Congress hanging in the balance.

The Democratic Party, currently holding a slim majority in the Senate and a narrow lead in the House of Representatives, is facing a formidable challenge from the Republican Party, which is eager to regain control and steer the nation's political course.

Recent polls suggest a tight race, with many key battleground states still undecided. In the Senate, Democratic incumbents in states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona are facing stiff competition from Republican challengers. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives could see significant shifts, with several competitive races unfolding across the country.

The midterms have been the focus of intense political rhetoric, with both parties accusing each other of mismanagement and incompetence. The Democratic Party has criticized the Republican Party's handling of various issues, including the economy, climate change, and healthcare. On the other hand, the Republicans have accused the Democrats of overreach on issues like voting rights and immigration.

The economy has emerged as a significant campaign issue. Inflation remains a concern for many Americans, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showing a 5.4% year-over-year increase in September. This has led to increased pressure on the White House, with critics arguing that the Biden administration's economic policies have contributed to the inflationary pressure.

Climate change is another critical issue, with both parties offering contrasting views. The Democratic Party has proposed a series of ambitious climate initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to combat climate change and lower prescription drug costs. In contrast, the Republican Party has been more skeptical about climate change and has criticized the Democrats' proposals as overly ambitious and costly.

Healthcare has also been a contentious issue, with the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) hanging in the balance. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of the ACA, and the outcome could have significant implications for millions of Americans who rely on the healthcare law.

Immigration has been another hot-button issue, with both parties offering contrasting views. The Democrats have called for a more humane and comprehensive approach to immigration, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The Republicans, on the other hand, have advocated for stricter border controls and a focus on enforcing existing immigration laws.

Voting rights have also been a contentious issue, with several states implementing new voting restrictions. The Democrats have accused the Republicans of trying to suppress voter turnout, while the Republicans have argued that the new restrictions are necessary to prevent voter fraud.

As the midterms approach, both parties are gearing up for a fierce battle. The outcome of the elections could have significant implications for the nation's political direction and the issues that will dominate the political agenda in the coming years.

In conclusion, the midterm elections are shaping up to be a crucial test of the nation's political divide. As partisan tensions rise, Americans will head to the polls to decide the future of the nation's political landscape. The stakes are high, and the outcome of the elections could have significant implications for the nation's economy, climate, healthcare, immigration, and voting rights.",mistral
Leeds pupil 'sent home' for selling hand sanitiser,"Title: Leeds Pupil 'Sent Home' for Selling Hand Sanitiser

A 14-year-old student from Leeds has been sent home from school after being caught selling hand sanitiser to fellow pupils.

The incident occurred at Oakwood High School, where the student, who wishes to remain anonymous, was reportedly selling small bottles of hand sanitiser for 50p each. According to sources, the student had been buying the sanitiser in bulk from various supermarkets and reselling it during school hours.

School officials were alerted to the situation when a concerned parent contacted them about their child being offered the sanitiser. The school then launched an investigation, leading to the student's suspension.

""We take matters such as this very seriously,"" a spokesperson for Oakwood High School said. ""Selling goods within school premises is against our rules and regulations, and we believe it's important to remind our students about the importance of honesty and integrity.""

The school has stressed that it understands the concerns surrounding the ongoing pandemic and the need for hand sanitiser, but selling it for personal gain is not the solution.

""We encourage our students to be considerate and supportive of each other during these challenging times,"" the spokesperson added. ""There are safer and more ethical ways to help each other.""

The student, who is in Year 9, has reportedly apologised for their actions and will be required to write an essay on the importance of honesty and the school's code of conduct. They will also be expected to donate the profits from their sales to a charity supporting vulnerable people during the pandemic.

This is not the first instance of a student selling goods within school premises. Last year, a student at another Leeds school was found selling stationery items, leading to a similar disciplinary action.

The incident has sparked a debate among parents and educators about the school's response and the wider implications of the student's actions. Some believe that the student was simply trying to make a profit in a situation where hand sanitiser is in high demand and short supply, while others argue that selling items within school is a breach of rules and sets a bad example for other students.

""It's a tricky situation,"" said one parent, who wished to remain anonymous. ""On one hand, I can understand why the student was selling the sanitiser, but on the other hand, it's important to teach our children about the rules and consequences of their actions.""

Oakwood High School has said that it will use this incident as a learning opportunity for all students, emphasising the importance of honesty, integrity, and a sense of community.

The student's actions have also highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by schools during the pandemic, as they strive to maintain a safe and supportive environment while navigating a complex and ever-changing landscape.

As the pandemic continues to impact daily life, it remains to be seen how schools will adapt and respond to such situations in the future. In the meantime, Oakwood High School has reiterated its commitment to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all its students.",mistral
"Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much","Title: ""Stephen Sondheim, the Man Who Felt Too Much""

In a career spanning over six decades, Stephen Sondheim, the titan of American musical theater, left an indelible mark on the world of arts. His death at the age of 91, on November 26, 2021, has sent shockwaves through the artistic community and beyond.

Born on March 22, 1930, in New York City, Sondheim was a prodigious child who excelled in music from an early age. His parents, both musicians, nurtured his talent and encouraged his passion for the arts. Sondheim's first major break came at the age of 27 when he was hired as a rehearsal pianist for the original production of ""West Side Story.""

However, it was his collaboration with director and producer Hal Prince that truly propelled Sondheim into the limelight. Together, they created a series of groundbreaking musicals, including ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" ""Company,"" ""Follies,"" ""A Little Night Music,"" ""Sweeney Todd,"" and ""Into the Woods.""

Sondheim's work was defined by its intellectual depth, complex characters, and intricate lyrics. His songs were not mere catchy tunes, but rather, they were vehicles for exploring the human condition, delving into the darker recesses of the human psyche.

In an interview with The New York Times, Sondheim once said, ""I feel too much."" This sentiment permeated his work, as he penned songs that captured the nuances of human emotion with a level of honesty and vulnerability that was unprecedented in musical theater.

Sondheim's music was not always popular, and he faced numerous rejections and setbacks throughout his career. But he never wavered from his vision. He once said, ""I'm not a populist. I'm not interested in writing something that everybody likes.""

Despite the challenges, Sondheim's work has had a profound impact on the world of theater. His musicals have been revived countless times, and his songs have been covered by some of the biggest names in music, from Barbra Streisand to Elton John.

Sondheim was also a prolific writer, authoring numerous books and articles, and serving as a mentor to countless young artists. He was a fierce advocate for artists' rights and a tireless champion of the arts.

In a statement, President Joe Biden said, ""Stephen Sondheim was one of our great artists. He gave voice to complex emotions that touch all of us, and his work will continue to entertain, comfort, and inspire for generations to come.""

Sondheim's legacy will undoubtedly live on in the countless lives he touched and the enduring impact of his work. His music, with its raw emotional honesty and intellectual depth, will continue to resonate with audiences for generations to come.

In the words of Sondheim himself, ""Art isn't easy. If it were, anybody could do it."" But with Sondheim's passing, it's clear that there will never be another quite like him. The world of arts has lost a titan, but his work will continue to inspire and captivate for years to come.",mistral
Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Title: Fashion Gaffes Reflect Industry's Diversity Problem

In the glamorous world of high fashion, a series of high-profile blunders has raised concerns about the industry's ongoing diversity issue. From casting all-white models in shows to releasing clothing lines with culturally insensitive designs, the fashion industry's lack of inclusivity is becoming increasingly apparent.

The latest incident involves a luxury fashion brand releasing a line of T-shirts adorned with stereotypical caricatures of Asian people. The designs, which included exaggerated features and offensive slang, were swiftly criticized on social media, leading to an immediate apology from the brand and the swift withdrawal of the T-shirts.

This incident follows closely on the heels of a high-profile fashion show where all models were white, despite the brand's claims of diversity and inclusion. The lack of representation sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for a boycott of the brand and demanding change.

The fashion industry has a long history of exclusion and insensitivity when it comes to diversity. In recent years, there have been numerous instances of brands releasing clothing lines with racially insensitive designs, or using models of a certain race to sell products to other racial groups.

These incidents are not only offensive, but they also highlight a lack of understanding and empathy within the industry. The fashion world is increasingly global, with consumers from all corners of the globe, yet the industry continues to struggle with representation and inclusivity.

The need for change is clear, and many within the industry are beginning to take action. Some brands are making a conscious effort to include models of all races and backgrounds in their shows and campaigns, while others are working to ensure that their designs are culturally sensitive and respectful.

However, more needs to be done. The fashion industry must prioritize diversity and inclusivity, not just as a trend, but as a fundamental value. This means not only including people of different races and backgrounds in shows and campaigns, but also ensuring that they are represented at all levels of the industry, from designers to executives.

The fashion industry has the power to shape perceptions and influence culture, and it is time for it to use that power for good. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, the industry can create a more welcoming and inclusive world, both on and off the runway.

It is up to all of us, as consumers and as members of the fashion community, to demand change and hold the industry accountable. By supporting brands that prioritize diversity and inclusivity, and by calling out those that do not, we can create a more diverse and inclusive fashion world.

The fashion industry has a long road ahead, but with determination and dedication, it can overcome its diversity problem and create a more inclusive and welcoming world. It is time for the fashion industry to step up and embrace change, for the sake of its consumers and for the sake of the world.

In conclusion, the fashion industry's ongoing diversity problem is reflected in the series of high-profile blunders that have occurred in recent months. From racially insensitive designs to all-white castings, the industry's lack of inclusivity is becoming increasingly apparent. It is time for the fashion industry to prioritize diversity and inclusivity, not just as a trend, but as a fundamental value. By embracing change and holding the industry accountable, we can create a more diverse and inclusive fashion world.",mistral
How much of your body is your own?,"Title: How Much of Your Body is Your Own?

In the realm of personal identity, the concept of individual ownership extends far beyond possessions and property. It reaches into the very essence of our bodies, raising questions about autonomy, privacy, and the limits of self. In an era of rapidly advancing biotechnology, the boundaries of personal ownership are being pushed, challenging long-held assumptions about what truly belongs to us.

The human body is a complex and interconnected system, a microcosm of life teeming with trillions of cells, each with its own unique genetic makeup. Yet, these cells are not ours in the traditional sense. Every cell in our body, except for the cells in our immune system, carries the exact same DNA. This DNA, passed down from our parents, is not unique to us, but shared with our biological relatives.

This shared genetic heritage is further complicated by the billions of microorganisms that reside within and on our bodies, collectively known as the microbiome. These microbes, far outnumbering our human cells, play crucial roles in our health and wellbeing. They aid in digestion, boost our immune system, and even influence our mood and behavior. Yet, they are not ours; they are the products of our environment and the legacy of our ancestors.

The question of personal ownership becomes even more complex when we consider the role of technology. Modern medicine has made it possible to transplant organs, tissues, and even entire limbs, allowing individuals to survive and thrive despite the loss of their original body parts. These transplanted parts carry the genetic information of their donors, raising questions about the ownership of these newfound limbs. Are they still part of the recipient, or are they the property of the donor?

Moreover, advancements in genetic engineering and synthetic biology open up new avenues for exploration. Scientists are now able to create organisms with custom-designed DNA, raising the possibility of designing and growing human organs from scratch. If these organs are implanted into a human body, who owns them? The creator, the recipient, or neither?

The ethical implications of these questions are profound. If our bodies are not entirely our own, what rights do we have over our genetic information, our microbiome, and our transplanted parts? Should we have the right to modify these aspects of ourselves, or should there be limits to preserve the integrity of our bodies and our identity?

These questions are not just hypothetical. They are being addressed in courts and legislatures around the world. In the United States, for example, a series of court cases have dealt with the ownership of stem cells, genetic information, and the rights of patients over their own bodies. Similarly, the European Union has proposed regulations to govern the use of genetic information and the ownership of synthetic biology products.

As we continue to push the boundaries of what it means to be human, it is crucial that we engage in open and honest discussions about personal ownership. We must balance the excitement of technological advancements with the need to protect our fundamental rights and our sense of self.

In the end, the answer to the question ""How much of your body is your own?"" may be elusive. But by exploring these complex questions, we can ensure that we navigate the future of biotechnology with wisdom, compassion, and a deep respect for the extraordinary journey of the human body.",mistral

Transcripts,"Title: Transcripts Reveal New Details in High-Profile Case

In a surprising development, transcripts from a closed-door hearing have shed light on previously undisclosed details in the high-profile case that has captivated the nation. The documents, obtained exclusively by our news outlet, offer a deeper understanding of the events leading up to the investigation and the parties involved.

The transcripts, totaling over 500 pages, contain testimonies from key witnesses and individuals connected to the case. They provide insights into the complex web of relationships, communications, and potential conflicts of interest that have been under scrutiny.

One of the most significant revelations comes from the testimony of John Doe, a former associate of the key figure under investigation, Jane Smith. In his testimony, Doe alleges that Smith had multiple undisclosed meetings with high-ranking officials from a prominent multinational corporation, Corporation X, in the months leading up to the investigation.

Doe claims these meetings were not disclosed in Smith's initial statement to investigators, and that they could potentially influence the outcome of the case. Corporation X has since issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and asserting that the meetings were of a routine business nature.

Another notable revelation comes from the testimony of an anonymous whistleblower, who claims to have direct knowledge of a cover-up attempt within the organization Smith was a part of. The whistleblower alleges that efforts were made to manipulate evidence and influence witnesses to protect Smith and certain high-level executives.

The whistleblower's testimony, which has not been independently verified, could have significant implications for the case if it holds up under further investigation. The organization in question has issued a statement denying the allegations and asserting that they have cooperated fully with investigators.

The transcripts also contain numerous emails and text messages exchanged between key figures in the case, offering a detailed timeline of events and communications. These documents suggest a pattern of suspicious activities and potential conflicts of interest that will undoubtedly be scrutinized by investigators and the public alike.

The release of these transcripts comes at a critical juncture in the case, as investigators are expected to make a decision on whether to press charges in the coming weeks. The new details revealed in the transcripts could significantly influence that decision, and the public will be closely watching for updates.

In response to the release of the transcripts, both Smith and Corporation X have issued statements denying any wrongdoing and asserting their commitment to transparency and the truth. However, the evidence presented in the transcripts raises serious questions about the integrity of the individuals and organizations involved.

As the investigation continues, the nation eagerly awaits the next developments in this high-profile case. The transcripts offer a tantalizing glimpse into the inner workings of the case, and it remains to be seen how they will ultimately impact the investigation and the lives of those involved.

MLB Life Put on Hold amid Rising Coronavirus Concerns,"**MLB Life Put on Hold amid Rising Coronavirus Concerns**

Major League Baseball (MLB) has paused its spring training and delayed the start of the 2020 season due to the escalating COVID-19 pandemic. The decision, announced on Thursday, marks a significant disruption in the sport's calendar and the lives of countless players, staff, and fans.

The league's commissioner, Rob Manfred, explained the decision, stating, ""In consultation with our medical experts, we have decided that the current circumstances necessitate that MLB pauses the operations of our clubhouses and ballparks."" The announcement came after a series of meetings between league officials, team representatives, and health experts.

The suspension of spring training and delay of the regular season follows similar actions taken by other major sports leagues, including the NBA, NHL, and MLS, as well as the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics. The recent spike in coronavirus cases across the United States has prompted many organizations to reconsider large public gatherings and prioritize the health and safety of their communities.

MLB teams have been instructed to return home from their spring training sites in Florida and Arizona. Players are encouraged to follow guidelines from health experts, including social distancing and self-quarantining, to reduce the risk of infection. The league is also working on plans to conduct workouts and practices for players at home, using technology to facilitate communication and monitoring.

The delay in the start of the season has yet to be determined, with MLB officials expressing hope that play can resume in some form later this year. Commissioner Manfred stated, ""Our hope is that the players will be able to report back to camp and that spring training will be able to resume in some form, and that we'll be able to get back to playing baseball as soon as possible.""

The decision to halt the season has left many players and fans grappling with the uncertainty of the situation. New York Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton expressed his disappointment, saying, ""It's tough to not play, but I understand why we're doing it. We just have to be patient and follow the guidelines to get through this.""

The financial impact of the suspension is also a concern, with many teams relying on the revenue generated during the spring training and regular season. Commissioner Manfred acknowledged the challenges ahead, stating, ""We recognize that this situation is unprecedented and presents many difficult issues that we will need to address. But our guiding principle will continue to be the health and safety of our players, employees, and fans.""

As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, the pause in MLB's season is a stark reminder of the far-reaching effects of the crisis. The league's decision to prioritize the health and safety of its community is a testament to its commitment to its fans and the broader public. While the delay in the start of the season is disappointing for players, staff, and fans alike, the hope remains that baseball will return to the diamond soon.

In the meantime, fans are encouraged to stay informed, follow the guidance of health experts, and do their part to contain the spread of the virus. As the situation continues to evolve, MLB and other sports leagues will undoubtedly face challenges and make difficult decisions. But one thing remains certain: the love of the game and the bond between players, teams, and fans will endure.

**UPDATE:**

The MLB Players Association (MLBPA) has released a statement expressing its support for the league's decision to halt the season. The MLBPA stated, ""The health and safety of our players, their families, and the entire baseball community is of paramount importance."" The statement also emphasized the importance of working together to find solutions that prioritize the health and safety of all involved while also addressing the financial implications of the delay. The MLB and MLBPA are expected to continue discussions in the coming days and weeks.

**UPDATE:**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued new guidelines recommending that gatherings of 50 or more people be postponed or cancelled for the next eight weeks. This recommendation is expected to have significant implications for MLB and other sports leagues, as well as a wide range of other organizations and events. The CDC's guidance undersco",mistral
'We are failing the elephants',"Title: ""'We are failing the elephants': A call to action in the face of escalating poaching and habitat loss

In a stark warning to the international community, conservationists and wildlife experts have issued an urgent call to action, highlighting the critical state of Africa's elephant populations and the escalating threat of poaching and habitat loss.

The latest report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reveals that African elephant populations have plummeted by 62% over the past decade, with an estimated 415,000 elephants remaining in the wild. The decline is primarily attributed to rampant poaching for ivory and habitat loss due to human encroachment and deforestation.

""We are failing the elephants,"" said Mike Chase, founder and CEO of Elephants Without Borders, a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of elephants and other wildlife in Botswana. ""If we don't act now, we are looking at the possible extinction of these magnificent creatures within our lifetime.""

The report underscores the urgent need for increased anti-poaching efforts, stronger laws and enforcement, and more effective management of protected areas. It also highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of human-elephant conflict, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education.

In Botswana, one of Africa's last strongholds for elephants, the situation is particularly dire. The country's elephant population has dropped by a staggering 85% in just five years, according to a separate study by Elephants Without Borders. This drastic decline is largely attributed to poaching, as well as the drought, which has forced elephants to migrate to areas where they come into contact with human settlements, causing conflict and often resulting in the death of both elephants and people.

""The poaching crisis in Botswana is a wake-up call for the world,"" said Chase. ""We need concerted international efforts to combat this crisis, not just for the sake of the elephants, but for the health of our planet as a whole.""

The call to action comes as the international community gathers in Geneva for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) CoP19. The meeting, which takes place every three years, provides an opportunity for governments, conservation organizations, and other stakeholders to discuss and address the most pressing issues facing the world's endangered species.

""We need a global commitment to protect elephants and their habitats,"" said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder and CEO of Save the Elephants. ""We have the knowledge, the technology, and the resources to turn the tide on this crisis. It's up to us to make it happen.""

The call to action has been met with support from various quarters, including the African Elephant Coalition, a group of African countries committed to the conservation of elephants. The coalition has called for a closed season on ivory sales, a moratorium on new ivory stockpile sales, and increased funding for anti-poaching efforts.

""The time for talk is over,"" said Paula Kahumbu, CEO of WildlifeDirect and the African Elephant Coalition's chair. ""We need action, and we need it now. The future of Africa's elephants hangs in the balance.""

As the world watches the unfolding crisis, conservationists and wildlife experts are urging the international community to take bold and decisive action to protect Africa's elephants. The fate of these majestic creatures, they say, is in our hands.

""We have the power to make a difference,"" said Chase. ""We just need the will to act.""",mistral
Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.,"Title: Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.

In a poignant tale of resilience and survival, two women in the bustling city of New York shared a terrifying ordeal as they both contracted the deadly Coronavirus. However, their stories took a starkly different turn as one woman succumbed to the virus while the other emerged as a beacon of hope, having successfully fought off the infection.

The first victim, a 62-year-old grandmother named Martha, was a vibrant and active member of her community. She was a dedicated volunteer at the local food bank and cherished her weekly game nights with friends. However, her life took a drastic turn when she tested positive for COVID-19.

Martha's symptoms began subtly with a slight fever and persistent cough. As the days passed, her condition worsened, and she was hospitalized. Despite the best efforts of the medical staff, Martha's body was unable to fend off the virus, and she passed away peacefully in the hospital, surrounded by her family via video call.

In stark contrast, another woman, a 45-year-old nurse named Emily, also tested positive for the Coronavirus. As a frontline worker, Emily had been caring for COVID-19 patients, and she believes she contracted the virus from a patient.

Emily's symptoms were severe from the outset, with a high fever and difficulty breathing. She was immediately hospitalized and placed on a ventilator. Despite the gravity of her condition, Emily refused to give up. She drew strength from her family, who rallied around her, sending daily messages of encouragement and love.
