(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.

Boston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.

Until I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.

I'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.

The pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)

The pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.

As Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.

""Even before the dawn of social media,"" they write, ""adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist.""

So true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, naÃÂ¯ve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.

But while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to ""go viral"") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?

Now that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?

I could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a ""socially-adept"" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.

Looking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.

I'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.

I think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.

There's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.

When we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).

Of course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to ""just ignore them"" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.

As difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.

Being 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.",I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.

556,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-school-closing-lunches-kids-eat/index.html,"(CNN) A school district in New York has canceled classes and activities until next week because a faculty member contracted the novel coronavirus.

Seattle Public Schools, near the epicenter of an outbreak in Washington, says a staff member tested positive for the virus this week, triggering closures for a minimum of 14 days.

And another district nearby has closed for up to two weeks and transitioned to ""online learning"" because a parent in the district has also contracted the disease.

But as other schools deliberate shutting their doors to slow the spread of the coronavirus, some parents may be left to wonder: If schools close, how will my child eat?

Across the United States, millions of students rely on school lunches, more than 20 million of which are distributed for free each day, according to the US Department of Agriculture

If classes are canceled, figuring out how to provide those meals to students is a challenge, with a web of federal rules governing when and where students can receive food.

While regulators have eased some of those restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, school closures remain ""an evolving situation with many unknowns and complex considerations that vary from one community to the next,"" said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association.

Federal waivers relax rules for coronavirus closures

When schools close unexpectedly -- during a pandemic , for example -- the USDA allows them to provide food to students using programs designed for summer meals, which are often offered at churches, parks and other community sites.

Schools can then be reimbursed by the federal government for the meals they provide, just as they would be during the summer, according to a USDA memorandum issued last year.

The catch, according to the School Nutrition Association, is that the meal distribution sites, including unused schools, must be located in areas where at least half of children come from low-income families.

Using those sites is a ""first step that gives schools in many low income communities the option to continue some form of meal service during coronavirus school closures,"" but the reality is that ""needy students live in all communities,"" said Pratt-Heavner, whose group represents school nutrition professionals.

Underscoring the complex bureaucracy that governs school lunches, meals distributed during unexpected closures also typically have to be eaten in "" congregate feeding "" sites intended to encourage community bonding.

But federal health officials have warned that students should avoid eating in large groups during the coronavirus outbreak, and the USDA issued waivers this past weekend to allow to-go meals in two states hardest hit by the coronavirus epidemic, California and Washington.

Sack lunches and grab-and-go foods

In Washington, a state that has seen more than 200 coronavirus cases, the Northshore School District has moved classes online because a parent tested positive for the coronavirus.

The district, which said it would not have in-person classes for up to two weeks, is offering meals for pick up at 22 school sites. Five production sites are making grab-and-go meals, according to Juliana Fisher, the district's director of food and nutrition services.

And while school closures are always a last resort, some of the nation's largest districts are also making plans to feed students if the coronavirus forces them to shut down.

Not far from the early epicenter of the US outbreak, for example, Seattle Public Schools prepared ""to provide sack lunches prepared by staff in our central kitchen,"" according to Tim Robinson, a spokesperson for the district.

The NYC Department of Education, which serves more than a million students, said that ""if a school is closed for 24 hours, we're prepared to serve grab-and-go breakfast and lunch for any student who wants it,"" according to spokesperson Miranda Barbot.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools, also one of the nation's largest school systems, said it would work with state and federal officials to ""ensure that students in any affected schools are provided with the meals they have come to depend on,"" according to spokesperson Jackie Calzadilla.

And Chicago Public Schools, which currently has one school closed, has ""established a special hotline and email for those families who need support with meals or have additional questions,"" said Emily Bolton, a district spokesperson.

Many schools are preparing to provide meals during potential coronavirus closures. But what those will look in practice -- especially if closures are widespread and prolonged -- remains to be seen.

In California, for example, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Unified School District, Shannon Haber, said that schools are operating normally. But ""we are planning for everything,"" she said. ""Meals to students included.""

Asked how meals would be distributed and what parents can expect, though, her response was brief: ""I have no further information at this time.""",The coronavirus pandemic is closing schools.

A 19-year-old pregnant woman from Guatemala died from injuries suffered after falling from the US-Mexico border wall, US and Guatemalan officials say.

Miriam Stephany GirÃÂ³n Luna fell as she tried to climb the steel mesh barrier near El Paso, Texas on Saturday.

She was taken to hospital where doctors tried to deliver the baby by emergency C-section without success.

Officials say the case indicates a change in how migrants are trying to reach the US amid new restrictions.

President Donald Trump has made the fight against illegal migration to the US a major policy issue and has taken measures to deter entry across the border from Mexico, including plans for a border wall. Large sections of the border near El Paso already have some form of barrier.

GirÃÂ³n Luna was travelling with a 26-year-old man believed to be her partner and the baby's father, and fell more than 6m (19ft), Guatemala's foreign ministry said on Thursday (in Spanish). The man eventually found US border patrol agents, who called for an ambulance to rescue her.

According to the statement, GirÃÂ³n Luna was taken to a hospital in El Paso with a cerebral haemorrhage, liver and kidney lacerations and a pelvis fracture. She underwent multiple surgeries but died from her injuries on Tuesday.

The Guatemalan statement said she was seven months pregnant while US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said she was eight months.

Gloria Chavez, CBP's El Paso sector chief, blamed the death on ""human smugglers"" who had ""encouraged her and helped her climb"" the barrier. ""We will engage our law enforcement partners in Mexico to find those responsible for placing these lives in danger,"" she said in a statement.

Media reports said GirÃÂ³n Luna was a social worker and beauty pageant winner and wanted to reach the US to help her family financially.

Tens of thousands of people from Guatemala and neighbouring El Salvador and Honduras have tried to enter the US in recent years with many saying they are facing violence and poverty.

The number of Guatemalans trying to climb the US-Mexico border wall rose recently because they no longer surrender to US border patrol, Tekandi Paniagua Flores, the Guatemalan consul in Del Rio, Texas, told the Associated Press news agency.

That is because changes implemented by the US government, including the Remain in Mexico policy that forces asylum seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico until a decision on their cases is reached, have made it more difficult for many people to remain in the US once they are caught.

The man who was travelling with GirÃÂ³n Luna is under US custody. Guatemala's foreign ministry said it had started the process to repatriate GirÃÂ³n Luna's body.

Ã¢ÂÂDo you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Horvath asks her editorÃ¢ÂÂs widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)

The show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. Ã¢ÂÂWhy arenÃ¢ÂÂt you mourning quietly?Ã¢ÂÂ asks Adam, HannahÃ¢ÂÂs boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editorÃ¢ÂÂs obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called Ã¢ÂÂAnd Now TheyÃ¢ÂÂre Dead.Ã¢ÂÂ Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer LÃ¢ÂÂWren ScottÃ¢ÂÂs suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.

Ms. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, Ã¢ÂÂHow can I really help?Ã¢ÂÂ It would be great if everyone said, Ã¢ÂÂCan I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ

Last February, on what would have been Ms. RosenthalÃ¢ÂÂs 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friendÃ¢ÂÂs Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of what she wrote wasnÃ¢ÂÂt true,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Feldman said. Ã¢ÂÂBeccaÃ¢ÂÂs mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. FeldmanÃ¢ÂÂs explanation for that kind of behavior is Ã¢ÂÂperformative grief,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, adding: Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, Ã¢ÂÂlook at meÃ¢ÂÂ behavior.Ã¢ÂÂ On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, Ã¢ÂÂ said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.

Then thereÃ¢ÂÂs the lingua franca of social media Ã¢ÂÂ the like button Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs totally discordant with death. Ã¢ÂÂMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing Ã¢ÂÂ136 people like thisÃ¢ÂÂ underneath?Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a Ã¢ÂÂsympathize button,Ã¢ÂÂ something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company.

(CNN) As America approaches the end of Donald Trump's first year as President , one point on which the entire country can agree is that this has been a year like no other in the nation's history. If the polls are to be believed, most of us see Trump's presidency so far as a slow-motion calamity.

And yet, not every development in the last year has been negative. The Trump presidency has energized the country and given it a new mood of seriousness.

It has reminded America about its priorities and caused its people to ponder important questions. Even if he has done so unwittingly, we can thank President Trump for bringing some exciting changes to the country. Here are five of Donald Trump's greatest unintentional accomplishments.

Sparking the women's movement and a conversation about decency

It all started before he came into office, when voters heard and saw how he talked to and about women. We heard the women who accused him of sexual harassment; we saw how he disparaged women on the campaign trail ; and we saw that he became President in spite of it all.

On the day after the inauguration, millions of women took to the streets around the world to make it clear that women would not sit back and watch Trump's style become the new normal. The women's march became likely the largest single day demonstration in US history.

And that was just the beginning. As the backlash against sexism has continued, courageous women revealed the extent of abuse they have experienced in all facets of life. The #MeToo movement took down some of the most prominent figures in journalism, entertainment, politics and elsewhere. And the tsunami against abuse is still raging.

It's no wonder ""feminism"" is Merriam-Webster's word of the year, its most searched term.

And the best is still to come.

The next elections should bring a tide of women to public office. EMILY's List, the group that helps women political candidates, reportedly says last year it had heard from about 1,000 women interested in getting its support. This year, the number skyrocketed to 22,000

Killing apathy

Trump's presidency has electrified the country, creating a sense of energy and urgency unlike anything the United States had seen in at least a generation. Today, even people who routinely muttered, ""I hate politics,"" and stayed uninvolved, are bristling with political thoughts and following the latest news about Trump's legislative agenda, the Russia investigation, and matters as obscure as the gap between what Trump says and what his secretary of state argues.

Americans have discovered that political apathy is a luxury better left to people living in countries where they trust their government.

Raising the question: What really makes America great?

As soon as he took office, Trump started trying to enact the agenda that he claimed would Make America Great Again. But to millions of Americans, Trump's agenda and rhetoric seemed to highlight precisely the opposite.

Trump forced many who had not given the matter much thought to consider what exactly it is that makes America great: its pursuit of ideals such as respect for the individual, for a free press, for equality; and the sacred notion of ""rule of law,"" that no individual, however powerful, stands above the law or should wield his power to interfere with justice.

Trump helped us understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism is love for one's country. It compels us to protect those characteristics that make it worth loving, and to strive to bring the country closer to its ideals. Nationalism, on the other hand, is what Trump preaches in his MAGA creed. It is an attitude of superiority, tainted with notions of ethnic and religious supremacy.

Reinvigorating journalism

When historians look back at the Trump era, they will note that Trump spawned a golden age of journalism. Even as Trump declared war on the media, casting doubt on any piece of news he found unflattering by calling it ""fake news,"" serious journalists went to work with more determination than ever.

Sure, journalists made mistakes, and when discovered, they were promptly corrected. That stands in sharp contrast to Trump's avalanche of lies. By The New York Times' count, Trump has told nearly six times as many falsehoods in 10 months than Barack Obama told in eight years as President. Trump succeeded in confusing the public and blurring reality. It was all in keeping with his gaslighting technique . But the reality-based media fought back with facts and with in-depth reporting that brought Americans history-changing truths.

Giving satire a shot in the arm

While Trump made Americans more serious, he also made comedians much funnier. Political humor blossomed like never before. Observers noted that the President himself hardly ever laughs unless in the company of adoring crowds, with his sense of humor limited to mocks and insults.

But for professional humorists, Trump was a godsend. The bittersweet cracks propelled the ruthlessly brilliant Stephen Colbert to new levels of hilarity, and the more Trump-centered his jokes became, the higher his ratings climbed.

So, you see, it hasn't all been bad. Perhaps Vladimir Putin is right when he says Trump has made significant achievements. Although, this is probably not what Putin or what Trump has in mind when he falsely claims he has accomplished more than any of his predecessors.

It's more along the lines of Colbert's comment after Roy Moore lost the election in Alabama, when he said , ""I'm a little shaky ... due to a condition my doctor calls 'hope.'""

These are at least five achievements from the Trump administration that can give Americans that same hope.","In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism","The Trump presidency has energized the country and given it a new mood of seriousness.

728,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump issued a federal emergency declaration Friday afternoon over the coronavirus outbreak following a week of cancellations, suspensions and growing case numbers that unsettled Americans nationwide.

An emergency or disaster declaration from the President frees up additional money and sets the Federal Emergency Management Agency in motion.

There are two types of declarations authorized by the Stafford Act, which is the statutory authority for "" most federal disaster response activities "": emergency declarations and major disaster declarations.

The difference between the two -- both of which unlock additional resources, like supplies and logistical help -- is scope and money.

Here's what to know about Trump's declaration:

What does a declaration do?

A declaration puts FEMA, which is supporting the Health and Human Services Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for coronavirus response, in a position to be the coordinator.

""The center of gravity switches from HHS headquarters to FEMA,"" said Daniel Kaniewski, who previously served as deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA.

More federal funds will become available, as will supplies, personnel and any other support. FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor told lawmakers Wednesday that the agency's warehouses are stocked with commodities across the country.

When activated, FEMA can help with logistics, like the transport of residents if needed, and put up temporary medical facilities. Those resources could come from across federal agencies, from stocked warehouses and through contracts. States will likely communicate what they need and where they need it.

Steve Reaves, president of the union that represents FEMA workers, said that during the California wildfires, for example, FEMA came in, put up tents, set up command and control centers, and worked with state and local governments to track casualties.

But during other health crises -- including Zika, H1N1 and SARS -- FEMA maintained a supporting role to HHS and declarations were never issued, according to Michael Coen, a senior adviser for emergency management at IEM and former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama administration.

""None of those became as big of an outbreak as we're seeing with COVID-19. But those were examples of FEMA being in support of HHS in some way, but without the use of a Stafford emergency declaration or major disaster declaration,"" he said.

Washington asked for a declaration on Thursday

Requests are generally made by the governor of an affected state. States have been scrambling to sort out what they need to respond to the increasing number of coronavirus cases before they make that request. During the week, FEMA personnel fielded questions from state staff about what support the agency -- which is within the Department of Homeland Security -- can provide to respond to the outbreak, said Reaves.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday requested that the administration declare a national emergency.

""It is incumbent on all of us to acknowledge the gravity of this public health emergency and take the necessary actions now Ã¢ÂÂ not tomorrow, not next week Ã¢ÂÂ to slow the spread of the virus and save lives,"" Inslee said in a statement Friday. ""By declaring a national emergency, the federal government can provide states with direct assistance to meet our residents' needs for health care, shelter, food and cash assistance, and more.""

Additional declarations might come later

Additional declarations might also be issued down the line, so the federal government can reimburse state and local governments for the costs incurred during an incident. For example, President Bill Clinton issued an emergency declaration in 2000 over the West Nile virus, authorizing millions of dollars in federal funds to reimburse affected local governments.

Declarations can start as one type of emergency and then change to another in order to access more resources. These declarations are separate from the national emergency Trump declared over the southern US border last year.

Why did it take so long to declare?

Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, in conjunction with Sens. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, and Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, sent a letter asking Trump to ""immediately"" consider disaster declaration requests for the coronavirus.

The reason for the delay in proceeding with a request may have been because states were still assessing their resources and the federal assistance received thus far.

""It's possible that a) the states have the resources it needs b) that the state has most of the resources it needs and the resources it doesn't have it's getting from HHS and the $8.3 billion,"" Kaniewski, who's now a managing director at Marsh & McLennan Companies.

""I think in the future if those -- and that future can be today or a week from now or it could be never -- if they require supplemental assistance beyond what they're getting from HHS, there would be an obvious time to submit an emergency declaration request.""

New Jersey told CNN on Thursday, for example, that it hadn't reached that point. ""Due to the recent release of more than $15 (million) in HHS funding that can be used for these COVID-19 costs, the State thresholds for FEMA assistance certainly have not been met yet,"" according to a statement from the governor's office Thursday.

As the crisis evolves, states will likely continue to review their needs and the role of federal assistance.",Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"(CNN) President Donald Trump issued a federal emergency declaration Friday afternoon over the coronavirus outbreak following a week of cancellations, suspensions and growing case numbers that unsettled Americans nationwide.
An emergency or disaster declaration from the President frees up additional money and sets the Federal Emergency Management Agency in motion.

But those were examples of FEMA being in support of HHS in some way, but without the use of a Stafford emergency declaration or major disaster declaration,"" he said.

727,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/task-force-coronavirus-trump-praise/index.html,"After being asked whether she was concerned that there could be patients who don't get a ventilator -- or if ""actual physical equipment that is needed to serve the people who get sick is out there"" -- Verma told Fox News: ""And that's why the President has taken such bold and decisive action. We're not waiting for this to get worse. We're not waiting for this to be a crisis in our health care systems.""

She did not answer the question. As health officials on the President's coronavirus task force have faced tough questioning about the federal government's ability to confront the ballooning crisis, they have at times turned to praising Trump instead.

And even though flattering the boss comes with the territory in the Trump administration -- a qualification on display in his first Cabinet meeting -- it's an approach health officials are now taking in the face of a major national crisis.

One official who has received praise from both sides of the political aisle for his straightforward answers is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the President's coronavirus task force. He was one of few officials to acknowledge deficiencies in diagnostic testing and has repeatedly yet delicately corrected the President on the timeline of vaccine development.

In recent days, some lawmakers have urged the President to let Fauci be the public face of the administration's response to coronavirus. The President has praised Fauci and pointed out the doctor's place on the task force -- but some of the lawmakers hope Trump will go further and just let Fauci do the talking.

Non-administration health officials have raised concerns about persistent delays in testing that have caused an obfuscated view of how widespread the virus is in the US, and hospital administrators have advised that they do not have the supplies or room to treat the patients they're expecting.

But when Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accompanied the president to the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta last Friday, he was asked to address the press. He took the opportunity to lavish praise on the man standing next to him.

""First, I want to thank you for your decisive leadership in helping us, you know, put public health first,"" Redfield said. ""I also want to thank you for coming here today and -- and sort of encouraging and bringing energy to the men and women that you see that work every day to try to keep America safe. So, I think that's the most important thing I want to say, sir.""

Then in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, an anesthesiologist who is in his mid-40s, insisted the President was ""healthier than I am"" after being asked if Trump and other aging Democratic candidates should stop traveling given they are in a category most vulnerable to contracting coronavirus.

""Speaking of being at risk, the President, he sleeps less than I do and he's healthier than what I am,"" Adams claimed. He later walked back the remark.

In the days since Trump announced that anyone who wants a test can get a test, a bipartisan group of lawmakers have expressed frustration with the lack of availability. One Republican senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, said the President's claim was inaccurate.""

""People should stop saying if you want a test, you should get a test right now,"" Lankford said after a briefing with administration officials. ""That's not here at this point.""",Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"As health officials on the President's coronavirus task force have faced tough questioning about the federal government's ability to confront the ballooning crisis, they have at times turned to praising Trump instead.

Not even fears about the coronavirus could stop many people from taking to the streets in India to celebrate Holi , one of the world's most photogenic religious festivals, although some donned face masks.

Others, including India's prime minister, opted to give it a miss altogether.

Usually a huge draw for tourists, Holi is traditionally celebrated across India, South Asia and among the Indian diaspora as the spring equinox approaches in the northern hemisphere. This year, it's celebrated on March 9 and 10.

With participants ranging from the old to the young, irrespective of class, the Hindu festival generally is viewed as a bringing together of the community, with swathes of people collectively taking to the streets of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other regions of India to celebrate.

Good over evil

Bright powders and water balloons are launched in the air by participants of ""the Festival of Colors"" with the aim of smearing and throwing as much gulal -- a fine powder offered in several shades -- as possible on friends and family.

Celebrated for centuries, the festival symbolizes the triumph of good over evil and commemorates new beginnings.

Over time, however, Holi has found a place in popular culture. It's now celebrated globally each year and inspires events such as ""The Color Run"" race series, and clothing design, such as Pharrell Williams and Adidas' Hu Holi shoe collaboration.

554,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/health/us-coronavirus-updates-friday/index.html,"(CNN) For many Americans, the past 48 hours have felt like uncharted territory.

Despite the unprecedented measures, one top US health official said the number of outbreaks is ""definitely going to get worse before it gets better.""

There's no way around it, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CNN on Thursday night. ""We will have a lot more cases.""

At least 1,740 cases have been reported across 48 states and the District of Columbia. At least 41 people have died: 31 in Washington state, which has been the epicenter of the outbreak, with at least 457 cases; four in California; two in Florida; one in Georgia; one in Kansas; one in New Jersey and one in South Dakota.

Among the new patients reported Friday was Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who said he would go into self-quarantine after he was in the same room last weekend as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his entourage. Bolsonaro's press secretary tested positive Thursday for coronavirus.

""I feel completely healthy and strong,"" Suarez said in a statement. ""However, I am doing the responsible thing by working with the County's Health Department to take every precaution to ensure that not only my family is healthy, but everyone I have come in contact with is healthy as well.""

The number of cases across the country will likely continue jumping as more tests become available and some facilities begin conducting drive-through testing.

Gatherings are banned, schools are closed

Across many states, the bottom line: Stay home. And if you have to go out, keep your distance.

Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon became the first states to announce statewide shutdowns of all K-12 schools. Friday morning, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the San Diego Unified School District -- which together serve more than 750,000 students -- announced they would close for two weeks, beginning Monday.

""You got to try to slow this thing down early,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told CNN's John Berman on Friday.

Ohio had only five confirmed cases of the coronavirus. But ""two weeks is too late. Another week is too late,"" DeWine said he'd been told by experts.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued guidance to shut down all public and private K-12 schools in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties, the state's most populous areas, for the next six weeks.

""Today's decision has a full range of implications from learning plans and childcare, to free and reduced-price breakfast and lunch, just to name a few,"" Inslee said in a statement. ""I anticipate this will cause ripple effects ... but we can't afford not to do it.""

A day earlier, Inslee announced a ban on all events with more than 250 people in the state's largest three counties. He has also issued guidance for assisting-living facilities to limit visitors after at least 10 homes reported cases.

The announcement paralleled the one by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who directed events with 500 or more people to be canceled or postponed and announced only ""medically necessary visits"" will be allowed in nursing homes. Some experts have advised banning all visitors from skilled-nursing facilities nationwide

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he stood by Cuomo's announcement on large gatherings and called the city's rising coronavirus case numbers ""striking and troubling."" New York City had 42 new cases in a day, he said.

""We don't do any of this lightly. This is difficult,"" he said at a Thursday news conference. ""We know it has a serious, serious impact on a number of businesses ... that's really, really painful for the many, many people who work in that field.""

Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said he asked the governor to issue an executive order to postpone the state's April 4 presidential primary for two months, until June 20. He said coronavirus was ""an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced.""

Similar directives were issued by California, Oregon, New Mexico, Ohio and Utah leaders, who urged the cancellation of large public events.

In Georgia, which had its first death Thursday and has reported 42 cases, officials designated a state park with emergency mobile units as an isolation site for residents who test positive.

At least nine school districts -- including the state's three largest -- also announced closures as early as Friday and lasting up to two weeks.

Others hit the pause button

Augusta National Golf Club on Friday announced that the Masters will be postponed in response to the outbreak. The year's first major was scheduled to tee off on April 9.

It was one of many cancellations that left the public stunned.

In New York, which reported 328 positive cases, the Broadway League said it is suspending all shows through April 12 ""in support of the health and well-being of the theatre public, as well as those who work in the theatre industry.""

The NBA is suspending the rest of its season, it said Wednesday, after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus. That announcement came shortly after the NCAA announced it would ban public audiences from March Madness games -- then a day later canceled the tournaments altogether.

Some shoppers panic-buy essentials

Fearing what might come, Americans from New York to Chicago to Atlanta flocked grocery stores, emptying shelves of essentials.

One Massachusetts resident told CNN it took nearly half an hour to check out as staff members reassured shoppers via intercom that the store would stay open all weekend.

In New York City, some grocery stores had little to nothing left, a Twitter user posted.

Go to any NYC grocery store or Target, view the empty shelves and tell me again the overreaction is on Twitter only, lol. pic.twitter.com/22WQdb1Ev7 Ã¢ÂÂ BeauxAfrique (@BeauxAfrique) March 12, 2020

""Well, it's been very intense,"" Avi Kaner, co-owner of Morton Williams, a New York supermarket chain, told CNN.

The uptick in business began about 10 days ago, Kaner said. But on Thursday, there was a record-breaking 300% to 400% surge in business, he said.

Certain items, like hand sanitizer and wipes, are being rationed by some distributors, Kaner said, and they're gone within minutes of being stocked in store.

""Whenever we do get new rations in of hand sanitizer and wipes, we actually put them out by the registers, and they go within minutes,"" he said.

Shopping patterns mirrored those ""you would see as people prepare for a major storm,"" a Walmart spokesperson told CNN earlier this month

At one grocery chain in Pennsylvania, shelves were kept ""packed with products similar to when a blizzard is being called for and folks know they might be stuck at home ,"" a sales executive said.

'Shutting down most of our structures of society'

DeWine said he wants his state to ""treat this like it is -- and that is a crisis.""

The state has reported five positive cases, but Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton said it's likely that number is not even close to the real tally of infections.

""We know now, just the fact of community spread says that at least 1%... of our population is carrying the virus in Ohio today,"" Acton said Thursday in a news conference. ""We have 11.7 million people. So, the math is: over 100,000. That just gives you a sense of how this virus spreads and is spreading quickly.""

""The steps we are taking will absolutely save lives,"" she said of the governor's actions. ""We're all sort of waking up to this new reality.""

State officials will release fact sheets and checklists to help residents ""figure out what this new norm is going to be like,"" she said.

""We are basically slowly shutting down most of our structures of society,"" she said.

Drive-through testing begins

The number of US cases is likely to be much higher and will continue to climb as more Americans are tested, health officials have said.

But that process, initially conducted by the CDC, has proved faulty. The slow rollout prompted the federal government to approve private labs to conduct their own testing and has so far sent out more than a million tests. Vice President Mike Pence said 4 million more would be available by the end of the week.

The testing system currently in place is not geared to the country's needs, and ""that is a failing,"" Fauci, with the National Institutes of Health, told a congressional committee Thursday

""The idea of anybody getting it (a test) easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,"" Fauci said. ""Do I think we should be? Yes, but we're not.""

Communities in New York, Illinois and Colorado began moving toward drive-through testing.

Health care workers from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment test people for Covid-19 on Thursday in Denver at the state's first drive-up testing center.

Cuomo announced New York will have the first drive-through testing facility on the East Coast and officials will start testing people by appointment in New Rochelle, a suburb community that registered more than 100 cases in about a week and has imposed a 1-mile containment zone

""You have to make an appointment. You can't just show up,"" Cuomo told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Friday.

With the anxiety and fear surrounding the virus, the governor said, it's not feasible to test just anyone who wants to be assessed.

""We have to prioritize, because we don't have that kind of capacity,"" he said.

A suburban Illinois hospital said it also will try drive-through tests, telling residents they would drive up to an ambulance and get tested without leaving their car, CNN affiliate WGN reported.",America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down,"There's no way around it, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CNN on Thursday night.

1250,https://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20200311-the-plot-against-americas-vision-feels-eerily-familiar,"Perhaps because our own times seem bleak, alternate histories are flourishing on screen, ranging from the dystopian, piercingly real HandmaidÃ¢ÂÂs Tale to the apocalyptic, mind-bending Watchmen and most recently Hunters, with cartoonish characters pursuing resurgent Nazis. All reassure us Ã¢ÂÂAt least that didnÃ¢ÂÂt happenÃ¢ÂÂ. Like The HandmaidÃ¢ÂÂs Tale, based on Margaret AtwoodÃ¢ÂÂs novel, the HBO series The Plot Against America has an impeccable literary source. Philip RothÃ¢ÂÂs 2004 novel posits that aviator Charles Lindbergh, a national hero, Nazi sympathiser and isolationist Ã¢ÂÂ all of those things historically true Ã¢ÂÂ became US president in the early 1940s, with Hitler on the rise.

More like this:

- The TV show that predicted the future

- Al PacinoÃ¢ÂÂs Nazi-hunting show is a hit

- Is this the new Big Little Lies?

The story is explosive. An ordinary, working-class Jewish family in New Jersey Ã¢ÂÂ Herman and Bess Levin, their two young sons and their relatives Ã¢ÂÂ grapple with the fallout of an anti-Semite in the White House. The showÃ¢ÂÂs high-profile creators are David Simon and Ed Burns, the team behind the classic series The Wire. And the performances are stunning, especially Zoe KazanÃ¢ÂÂs as the fearful but realistic Bess and Winona RyderÃ¢ÂÂs as her self-deluding sister, Evelyn. So why is this uneven miniseries far less compelling than it sounds on paper?

It becomes more chilling the more it departs from reality, with terrible events that are not unimaginable

Part of the problem lies with history itself. What Roth imagined as outlandish in 2004 is all too familiar now. LindberghÃ¢ÂÂs real-life isolationist slogan Ã¢ÂÂAmerica FirstÃ¢ÂÂ has been appropriated by Donald Trump. In the years since the novelÃ¢ÂÂs publication, ethnic hatred and white supremacism have been resurgent around the world. In many ways, RothÃ¢ÂÂs history doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem alternate at all.

That problem is compounded by the showÃ¢ÂÂs earnest, dutiful approach. The first three of its six episodes are not bad if you have a high tolerance for didactic kitchen-sink drama. The last three gain in intensity. The series becomes more chilling the more it departs from reality, with terrible events that are not unimaginable but still unrealised.

As the story slowly builds, Herman remains a fiery idealist, passionately and effectively played by Morgan Spector. Lindbergh is a threat to the familyÃ¢ÂÂs upwardly-mobile life and their civil rights, but Herman is determined to stand his ground. Bess wants above all to protect her family. Kazan brilliantly and sensitively makes her a woman of her time. As anti-Semitism becomes more virulent, Bess thoughtfully chooses when to argue with her husband, when to let him lead, and when itÃ¢ÂÂs time to insist that if he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt move the family out of danger and into Canada, she will. Their adolescent son, Sheldon, sees Lindbergh only as a dashing pilot, conveying the perils of celebrity hero-worship. The younger son, Philip, takes it all in, an increasingly frightened child. The brown palette of the LevinsÃ¢ÂÂs world looks perfect in its drabness, from the shabby but pristine rowhouse to BessÃ¢ÂÂs practical cotton housedresses.

The extended family comes to include Lionel Bengelsdorf, a rabbi with Confederate ancestors, who is also an outspoken Lindbergh supporter, swallowing the idea that being pro-Hitler is a justified defence against communism. Played by John Turturro with a dripping Southern accent, Bengelsdorf is a problematic, unexplored character. We never quite see why he is so gullible.

Evelyn, sophisticated and lonely, cares for her ailing mother. She eagerly becomes BengelsdorfÃ¢ÂÂs assistant and then his fiancÃÂ©e. Ryder is triumphant in a role much enhanced from the book, as she makes EvelynÃ¢ÂÂs self-delusion painfully clear. Bengelsdorf is rich, attentive, and has access to powerful people. Evelyn lets herself ignore all the political warning signs, and even enrols Sheldon in her fiancÃÂ©eÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂJust FolksÃ¢ÂÂ program, sending Jewish children for a summer in the rural US in a barely-veiled attempt to dilute their ethnicity.

The conclusion is moving and more pessimistic about the possibilities for equality in the US than Roth was

But all this powerful acting is often saddled with sledgehammer dialogue drawing parallels to today. When swastikas are drawn on headstones at a Jewish cemetery, HermanÃ¢ÂÂs brother Monty (David Krumholtz) blames the president. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂve always been here,Ã¢ÂÂ he says of the bigots, Ã¢ÂÂbut now itÃ¢ÂÂs like they have permission to crawl out from under a rockÃ¢ÂÂ. Similar lines have echoed through real life in the past few years. When Monty comes to tolerate Lindbergh, Herman is outraged. Ã¢ÂÂStock market is up, profits are up,Ã¢ÂÂ he yells. Ã¢ÂÂEverything else about Lindbergh, what he stands for, is forgotten!Ã¢ÂÂ That dialogue might as well be a giant finger pointing toward Trump. The line resonated more pointedly before the recent market collapse, of course. Even alternate histories have trouble keeping up.

Some scenes in the final episodes make it worth slogging through the early ones. Kazan is heartbreaking as she tries to calm a small boy on the phone, and fierce when she confronts her sister. When Lindbergh invites HitlerÃ¢ÂÂs Foreign Minister, Von Ribbentrop, to a White House dinner, Lionel and Evelyn are guests, giving cover to the idea that the president canÃ¢ÂÂt be anti-Semitic if he has invited a rabbi. Evelyn, blithely smiling, dances with Von Ribbentrop, her head so turned by the glamour that nothing else matters. At dinner Lionel quietly pushes aside the shrimp on his plate, and makes excuses when Lindbergh rudely snubs him. Here, finally, are dramatised scenes that are terrifying and eye-opening because they are so personal and specific. In those too-few moments, the series doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to tell us what to think.

The conclusion is moving and more pessimistic about the possibilities for equality in the US than Roth was. Yet even that sobering ending doesnÃ¢ÂÂt escape the tone of a classroom lecture. The Plot Against America has high, half-realised ambitions. Preaching to its audience didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to be one of them.

Of course, we found that women in the United States, too, struggled against the limitations of their prescribed roles. But in my childhood in the '70s and '80s in the shadow of Second Wave feminism, there was an assumption that as the laws changed to allow women more public participation, social norms would evolve too.

Many didn't. In the United States and other countries, attitudes about gender roles have proved remarkably persistent. A new United Nations Development Programme index on social norms related to gender suggests that bias forms the glass ceiling that blocks women's advancement in all aspects of their lives.

Almost 90% of the world's men, and women, are biased in some way against women, according to the Gender Social Norms Index. Half of men and women feel that men make better political leaders. More than 56% feel that men have more right to a job and/or make better business executives.

(CNN) Last week, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc and Matthew Perry took to their Instagram feeds to confirm the long-held suspicions of fans around the world: the ""Friends"" gang is getting back together for a reunion.

We don't know what form the show will take. But it puts a renewed and 21st century spotlight on the 1990s favorite -- which for many, defined a generation, and has for years after its run ended enjoyed enduring popularity in syndication and on Netflix . As even devoted fans can recognize now, ""Friends"" often ended up on the wrong side of cultural history, highlighting many troubling norms of its time. This reunion on HBO Max is a timely opportunity for fans and new observers to ponder exactly why many people still love this show, and to ask what the hopefully older, wiser group of ""Friends"" might potentially acknowledge on the Central Perk sofa, this time around. (Like CNN, HBO Max -- a streaming service set to launch in May -- is owned by Warner Media.)

For starters, the ""Friends"" reunion might take a stab at talking about the original show's glaring lack of diversity. While there were equivalent non-white sitcoms in the 1990s, it was a gigantic oversight for arguably the decade's biggest program -- set in one of the biggest, most diverse cities in the world -- to have such poor representation of anyone not straight, white, middle-class and thin.

David Schwimmer noted in a recent interview his awareness of the show's lack of diversity, suggesting there should be an ""all-black 'Friends' or an all-Asian 'Friends'."" Erika Alexander, a cast member of the show ""Living Single,"" which also portrayed a group of young single city-dwelling friends and debuted a year before ""Friends"" took to Twitter to point out what appeared to be a glaring assumption that such a show hadn't already existed. Schwimmer replied in a tweet: ""I didn't mean to imply Living Single hadn't existed or indeed hadn't come before Friends, which I knew it had.""

Compared to shows like ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"" which handled not only racial politics, but issues like generational and class divides with humor and elegance, ""Friends"" remained pretty static in its cozy middle-class bubble. Any point of difference was used as a kooky reference -- ""Phoebe used to be homeless, so she's super tough!"" -- rather than an opportunity to explore a potentially juicy theme or raise viewers' social consciousness.

Issues which shouldn't have been issues -- like Monica's childhood fatness -- were used for cheap, offensive laughs. Plump, clumsy, naive adolescent Monica (shown through frequent flashback scenes over the years) wasn't even allowed to have the same personality as thin, efficient, sharp Monica -- she was just a ""fun"" extra character who sometimes just showed up.

On the rare occasions someone who didn't fit the mold appeared on ""Friends,"" they were used as a foil for the main, L'Oreal-ready cast's experience. Take the treatment of Chandler's -- apparently, but not explicitly -- transgender dad, played by Kathleen Turner. Their identity wasn't ever addressed head-on in the show, but the general impression is that it's confusing, and therefore traumatic for Chandler. Their presentation is used as fodder for grim lines like, ""Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?"" It'd be cool to see that relationship discussed. For instance, Turner has said that she wouldn't accept the same role now.

Of course, there are other LGBTQ concerns the gang could talk about. One of the show's longest-running jokes -- introduced within the first few minutes of the 1994 pilot -- is that Ross was dumped by his first wife, Carol, for another woman, Susan. While it was unusual in the 1990s to feature a gay female couple on TV, and particularly groundbreaking for its time to feature them as parents, that visibility is undermined by the main joke being that it's embarrassing for Ross to have been dumped for another woman. From Ross's first meeting with her , Carol's girlfriend Susan is painted as an unreasonable baddie, and the pattern of gay-is-a-punchline is set up for many seasons thereafter. The Susan of 2020 would deserve to be portrayed now as a total hero for putting up with it all.

""Friends"" was hardly the only show of the era which failed to take gay female relationships seriously. When ""Sex and the City""'s Samantha started dating a woman in the show's fourth season, her friends' responses are initially snide and disrespectful. Her friend Charlotte remarks: ""Maybe she [Samantha] just ran out of men?"" It's used as just another instance in which Samantha is judged for her sexual proclivity by her supposedly enlightened pals.

The slut-shaming mentality of the 1990s also occasionally emerged on ""Friends."" One of the early sticking points of Richard and Monica's relationship is how many sexual partners Monica has had. When Monica reveals the number, Richard -- a friend of Monica's dad and portrayed by Tom Selleck -- sits down, breathing a relieved sigh: ""You had me thinking it was like, a fleet."" The strong implication is that had the number been higher, that would have been a problem. It's a weird point to focus on, considering Richard dating Monica, whom he has known since she was a baby, is the equivalent of Joey, in 2020, dating Ross and Rachel's daughter Emma.

You have to hope that if dating comes up among the ""Friends"" of 2020, they might at least advocate for doing a few things differently in retrospect -- and indeed, all sexual interactions. Joey's womanizing, Ross's history as a controlling, jealous boyfriend, and Chandler's cruel treatment of his girlfriend Janice, are well-documented. But some early events outside the main cast are more sinister. In season one, when Rachel's boyfriend Paolo gropes Phoebe while she's giving him a professional massage, the gang treats the incident as a form of cheating. Phoebe even apologizes to Rachel for the fact that Paolo ""made a move"" on her. Post #MeToo, that ""dramatic twist"" reads very differently.

Considering how little the show commented on the part where touching women without consent is actual assault, it stands out even more today how hyper-sensitive the gang were to entirely benign events involving women's bodies or parenting. When Carol breastfeeds her son, Ben, early on in ""Friends,"" Joey and Chandler make their horrified escape as soon as possible. This wasn't just a male thing on 1990s sitcoms, apparently; Carrie on ""Sex And the City"" legs it when she sees her friend Miranda feed her new baby. By contrast, actual problematic parenting -- see Ross hating on his son Ben's Barbie, and firing the male nanny for being ""too sensitive"" -- is seen as kind of cute. Less than two decades ago, men got credit just for being in the same room as their offspring.

So what might HBO Max's upcoming special have in store? You've gotta hope that by 2020, the gang has some perspective on the internalized -- and externalized -- misogyny of their show's youth. At the very least, they likely have a better understanding of the world beyond Central Perk, where objectifying women is bad, and ignoring stale gender binaries is good.

880,https://us.cnn.com/2017/12/20/opinions/what-its-like-to-be-me-disability-rebecca-cokley-opinion/index.html,"This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, "" What it's like to be me ,"" which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn't ask me. He didn't even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, ""While you're down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?""

At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: ""No!""

As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren't seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.

The delivery room wasn't my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn't always perfect for me growing up. My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, ""Kids like you don't go here, you go to the special school."" If it weren't for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.

I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be ""different"" in a way that he is not.

When he comes, I'll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I've always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.

With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist -- who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn't ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business. I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation -- which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.

I don't know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I've asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.

While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it's also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.

Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act is that it's easier for people with disabilities to become parents. It's natural to assume that once people with disabilities have remedies for discrimination and greater access to society, they'll do exactly what a lot of nondisabled people do: get married and have kids. This was always a logical conclusion to me, as both my parents were little people (which is rare -- 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it).

Growing up with a disability

My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world , affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.

My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.

I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor's and master's degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley with their two kids

I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith's latest film, ""Dogma,"" and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.

It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm -- and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.

All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the ""gay cancer,"" my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.

I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, ""We're here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They're no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we'd hope they would be here for us.""

And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.

'Mom, I think I want to be a clown'

When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. ""Mom, I think I want to be clown."" She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. ""What?"" she asked.

""Yeah, I think I want to be a clown."" We rode home in silence. I didn't realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.

I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.

Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller , an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read ""for fun.""

My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.

Taking this path was important to me -- and to my family as well.

Rebecca Cokley with her mom.

When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school. It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn't have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having ""midget midget"" shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.

Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.

My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos , the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job -- at Victoria's Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.

You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, ""You have to make someone want something they don't need and want to pay too much for it.""

My boss at Victoria's Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I'd have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.

I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They'd actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. ""Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit."" (We all wore black suits). ""Well, she's petite."" (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.

The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were ""fascinated"" with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, ""We could pick you up and walk out with you. We'd take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us."" I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened ""spidey sense"" because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.

Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth . I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away -- cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by ""staring at the new girl."" I have no memory of this.

Building a family

Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.

Patrick is average height and African-American. I'm a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I'm the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he's the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.

Rebbeca Hare and Patrick Cokley were married at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Columbia.

When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that's how those of us in the community refer to ""little people"") friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn't ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height -- they'd ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn't care either way.

I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama's White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, ""I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules."" And those are really the values that we stress as we're raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.

At age 6, Jackson's awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, ""Mom, you're white, Dad's black, and I'm peach."" His dad turned around and said ""Peach? You're black."" Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said ""Peach!"" This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.

We've purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It's important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.

Since we're raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband's childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can't -- and in some cases, shouldn't -- be the one to answer.

As a professional advocate, I've spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police -- Eric Garner , Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland -- were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.

Rebecca Cokley and President Obama pose for a snapshot.

Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now -- their curiosity, their feeling that they've never met a stranger, their trust in the world -- could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.

My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn't keep it from him.

Parenthood and activism: our forms of protest in the world

When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn't be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well . Whether it's forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the ""well-meaning"" nondisabled public for centuries.

No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.

Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent's disability. In my work as an advocate, I've spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.

If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language. Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like ""special needs,"" ""differently abled,"" or, in a pun on language from the past, ""handi-capable.""

These aren't words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with -- they were defined by society because the concept of ""disability"" makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It's a reminder that yes, we are different.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley and their kids in their Washington neighborhood.

But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that ""disability"" is something to be ashamed of -- say, by implying that someone shouldn't have more children because of one -- society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights. We didn't celebrate the 27th anniversary of the ""Americans with Special Needs Act"" this summer, after all.

The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT -- with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police -- and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.

They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live -- in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims

We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It's impossible not to -- and we would be irresponsible if we didn't.

We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don't have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women's march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn't I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, ""I am the mommy,"" but not a single one apologized to me.

As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don't know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don't care either way.

What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

According to Tacoma Police, officers responded about 3:45 p.m. Tuesday to a disturbance at an apartment in the 1800 block of South 82nd Street. When they arrived, they found a 61-year-old woman dead. She has since been identified as Sarann Suong, according to court documents.

Her 30-year-old son, Larry Suong, has been charged with first-degree murder and pleaded not guilty to her death. HeÃ¢ÂÂs in jail on a $1 million bond.

Police said Sarann Suong had just walked in her front door when her son attacked her, stabbing her multiple times in her face, head and neck.

According to court documents, her son said he stabbed her because he was not going to allow her to yell at him on that particular day. Neighbors told The News-Tribune that Sarann was a nice woman, but her son often caused trouble around the complex.

(CNN) For just a moment Wednesday night you might have thought President Donald Trump was at long last grasping the gravity of the coronavirus situation and taking the necessary steps to confront what may be the most serious crisis the country has faced since he took office -- one that could lead to the deaths of vast numbers of people.

Trump tried to give a serious address to the nation from the Oval Office, laying out a plan to tackle the pandemic. But it quickly became apparent that this was one more error-filled display in what has been a grotesque carnival of incompetence.

The Europe travel and cargo ban started making headlines around the world while the President was still on the air. Anxious families wondered how they'd get traveling children home. Importers were in shock.

But just moments after the speech ended, the Department of Homeland Security issued a "" clarification ."" Turns out Trump got much of it wrong , even though he was reading from a teleprompter.

DHS said the restriction would not apply to Americans or US residents and their families, and would cover only foreigners who over the past 14 days spent time in certain European countries. It doesn't cover cargo. In short, it's nothing like Trump's dramatic announcement. Instead, it's a partial ban on flights from the area known as Schengen, a 26-country European travel bloc. The White House issued the proclamation , confirming DHS's version. There was also no mention of 30 days.

It gets worse. Trump also announced what would have been a milestone in fighting the fast-spreading contagion. Leaders of the health insurance industry, he said, ""have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments."" That would have broken through one of the most dangerous obstacles to containment, allowing more Americans to seek the care they need without fear of bankruptcy. But that too was wrong.

The insurance industry corrected him, saying they have agreed to waive co-payments "" for testing, not for treatment ,"" a colossal difference from what Trump indicated.

How is it possible that the President of the United States gets so much wrong about something so important in a speech from the Oval Office? We don't know if his speechwriters got it wrong or if he somehow improvised. Either way, it's disastrous and unacceptable.

The frontrunner in the Democratic primary, former Vice President Joe Biden, by contrast, modeled a statesmanlike approach in remarks on Thursday, when he offered his own plans for addressing the virus and its associated economic perils. Taking aim at Trump's words from the night before, Biden urged Americans not to ""panic or fall back on xenophobia""; ""labeling Covid-19 a 'foreign virus' does not displace accountability for the misjudgments thus far"" of the Trump administration, Biden said.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has magnified the danger of everything we have seen from this president from the day he took office.

From the start of the epidemic, Trump did nothing but ignore, minimize and mislead the public, while draping himself in cringeworthy, unctuous praise from officials who diminished themselves to avoid upsetting him, after seeing how those who spoke the truth incurred his wrath.

When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Nancy Messonnier warned that the virus would inevitably spread and we should prepare, Trump was reportedly furious according to the Washington Post.

Trump called the response and news coverage about the gravity of the virus a "" hoax ,"" and his enablers at Fox News and elsewhere irresponsibly followed suit

When the US had two dozen cases and experts said more would come, he contradicted them, saying it was not inevitable

As the number of cases and deaths grew exponentially at home and abroad -- Italy has gone from three cases three weeks ago to more than 12,000 now -- Trump incessantly tweeted and repeatedly declared that the seasonal flu kills thousands, and we don't make such a fuss.

He kept that line in what was a downright bizarre press conference at CDC headquarters last week. ""The [virus] tests are all perfect,"" he gushed, adding outlandishly ""like the letter was perfect,"" a reference to his Ukraine impeachment case. ""It's all performing perfectly, now it's performing perfectly in all places. And how was the show last night? Did it get good ratings?"" He had been on Fox the night before. Amid the random topics, he managed to include multiple falsehoods about the virus, adding to the confusion in the official message to the public.

A reporter who was there said he found Trump's statements "" terrifying .""

The most troubling statement , in my view, came when he was asked whether people on a cruise ship should be brought ashore. ""I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship."" That adds to concerns about why the US is not testing more people, a concern made worse by Trump's Tuesday address, when he boasted that US numbers are better than Europe's. (Few US tests are the likely reason.)

It apparently took a collapse in stock prices to persuade the president that this is not a public relations and marketing problem that can be solved with ""alternative facts."" So, he wore his stern face to the Oval Office and addressed the nation.

America's European allies were not only baffled by what they heard, they were livid . In a rare statement criticizing the US, they strongly condemned Trump's decision, which many viewed as motivated by politics rather than science. ""The coronavirus is a global crisis,"" they said, ""it requires cooperation, rather than unilateral action."" Contrary to what Trump indicated in the speech, they said the travel ban was ""taken unilaterally and without consultation.""

This is but a small sliver of the mistakes and misguided moves by the President and an administration where the principal requirement for a top job is obsequious loyalty to the President.

On the whole, the Trump administration has been incompetent and ineffectual. According to Ashish Jha, head of Harvard's Global Health Institute, ""Our response is much, much worse than almost any other country that has been affected.""

The number of infections and deaths will continue climbing, and the top man in the government has undercut the efforts of the professionals and insulted US allies, showing himself incapable of handling the crisis. With the virus raging, countless lives will be lost. The President's inattention arguably delayed a stronger response, and his misrepresentations, self-serving messages, and incompetent actions have only added to the problem. It's time for Trump to stand aside and let qualified professionals do their jobs.","It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President","The Europe travel and cargo ban started making headlines around the world while the President was still on the air.

1051,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-schools.html,"A public hospital nurse, for example, would likely not be able to stay home from work even if her child was home from school. And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

Ã¢ÂÂThe downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the CouncilÃ¢ÂÂs health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving Ã¢ÂÂreports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,Ã¢ÂÂ said ScarsdaleÃ¢ÂÂs school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday. Ã¢ÂÂPreventative measures are only effective if we embrace and implement them as a community.Ã¢ÂÂ

Most public schools across the state remain open, with some major exceptions, including public schools in Scarsdale, East Ramapo, and New Rochelle in Westchester County, which is the epicenter of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs outbreak. Initially, only three New Rochelle public schools located in a one-mile Ã¢ÂÂcontainmentÃ¢ÂÂ zone closed earlier this week, but the entire district shut down on Friday following protests from families.

Inside New York CityÃ¢ÂÂs schools this week, educators were concerned and conflicted.

Ã¢ÂÂThankfully, itÃ¢ÂÂs not my decision,Ã¢ÂÂ said Liat Olenick, a teacher at the Brooklyn Arbor School in Williamsburg, of closure.

947,https://us.cnn.com/2016/02/21/opinions/scalia-argument-capital-punishment-prejean/index.html,"Sister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of "" Dead Man Walking ."" The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.

As I was writing ""The Death of Innocents,"" I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was ""taking him on"" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, ""And I'll be right back at ya!""

In ""Innocents,"" I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the ""machinery of death.""

In grasping the ""meaning"" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.

One thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his ""originalist"" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.

After all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal ""experts,"" every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?

I have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.

As for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.

Given what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.

In 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.

I say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in""The Death of Innocents,"" taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.

Three years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments.""

In his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of ""idiot"" as ""such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is."" According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's ""idiot"" test.

My second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.

These stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by ""modern trends,"" as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.

Thus, Scalia could not brook American bishops' increasing opposition to the death penalty, nor the opposition of Popes John Paul II and Francis -- especially Pope Francis, who must have disturbed the justice considerably in his bold appeal before Congress for global abolition of the death penalty.

-- ""It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States.""

-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, ""The powers that be are ordained of God,"" to mean: ""Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy.""

Democracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.

Where was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking ""an eye for an eye,"" to pray for and forgive our enemies?

In Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.

In this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem ""enemy.""

It seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.

I also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom ""equal justice under law"" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.",My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"Photos: Death row's nun Sister Helen Prejean has been on a mission to end the death penalty for three decades.

466,https://us.cnn.com/2019/08/04/tech/nasa-management-apollo-silicon-valley-scn/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Silicon Valley, its visionaries like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and the entire tech revolution may not have happened without the Cold War space race.

President John F. Kennedy's iconic 1962 speech, directing the United States to put boots on the moon within the decade, set in motion a leap in innovation. In just seven years, America went from lagging the Soviet Union in space technology to planting a flag on the lunar surface.

The Apollo program was the birthplace of the modern tech ecosystem, says Basil Hero, a former investigative reporter and media executive who authored the new book "" The Mission of a Lifetime .""

""Without [Apollo], I don't think the computer revolution would have happened as quickly and on the same trajectory,"" Hero told CNN Business. ""It would have taken an extra 10 or 20 years.""

Apollo, the startup

NASA's Apollo program was the first-ever ""moonshot."" And the ingredients that led to its success were a whatever-it-takes attitude, loose management structures, and deep funding.

Kennedy estimated early on that the first moon landing would cost about $7 billion to $9 billion. But the first thing James E. Webb did when he became NASA's administrator in 1961 was tell Kennedy to double that amount. It was a move ""any venture capitalist who has funded a high-tech startup would understand,"" Hero writes in ""The Mission of a Lifetime.""

The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is insisting they can launch their companies on the cheap, Hero said. They can end up low-balling their way out of business.

Congress was the Apollo program's financial backer, writing big checks year after year. Lawmakers even authorized NASA in 1962 to offer ""supergrade"" salaries so that the space agency could afford to hire the best and brightest, Hero notes in his book.

But, NASA could not lumber along as a bureaucratic regime if it wanted to blast humans to the moon in less than 10 years.

Enter George Mueller . He left a prestigious career at research groups such as Bell Labs to lead NASA's human spaceflight program in 1963. The space agency's history office describes him as ""a no-nonsense, forward-thinking leader"" who ""introduced a remarkable series of management changes.""

Mueller created a ""flat organization"" structure: He cut out middle management and ""made sure that the engineers on the front line were able to get their concerns straight up to the top people of NASA,"" Hero said. If safety concerns were raised or an idea just wasn't working out, decision makers listened and quickly shifted course.

""They really did trust people in the lower levels, and the engineers benefited from that,"" Hero said.

Today, California's hive of startups and tech giants, from Facebook to Google , still swear by the same management technique.

Netflix NFLX ""Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them,"" notes in its widely influential workplace culture manifesto. ""We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix Ã¢ÂÂ giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions.""

Apollo managers also had no problem bringing in young visionaries to take on unprecedented tasks, a move emulated by Silicon Valley and its obsession with young minds thinking outside the box.

Mission Control in Houston, Texas, for example, was an operation that had no precursor, and no one knew how to run it. So its manager, Christopher Kraft, brought in a bunch of ambitious 20-somethings. The average age of Mission Control employees during the Apollo 11 moon landing was just 26, Hero notes.

Making more moonshots

In terms of computing power, a modern cellphone could outdo the entire Apollo spacecraft, physicist Michio Kaku wrote in a 2011 book

The digital revolution that followed Apollo was no accident. Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs built off computing technology that NASA incubated during the Apollo era, Hero said.

Some of the tech titans that dominate today's headlines credit NASA and Apollo as a source of inspiration, and a few have Apollo-like ambitions of their own.

(CNN) As the coronavirus continues to spread and the number of infected individuals surpasses 100,000 , President Donald Trump and his allies are doing their best to convince Americans that it's not a major cause for concern and may actually have some benefits for the American economy.

Last Wednesday, Trump told Fox News viewers he had a ""hunch"" that WHO estimates on the virus's mortality rate were wrong and that many Americans infected with the virus could continue to go to work. Trump surrogate Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida emphasized the ""hilarity"" of the virus by wearing a gas mask during the House vote on funding to fight the virus.

Days after his gas mask stunt, Florida officials announced that the coronavirus had killed one of Gaetz's constituents. And Monday afternoon, Gaetz announced he was self-quarantining after being informed a person he had contact with during last week's CPAC conference had since tested positive for coronavirus. He had spent the weekend with Trump at his resort in Florida.

But by far the most prevalent party line among those seeking to distract from the Trump administration's early bungling of their response to the coronavirus has been reassuring the public that the virus really ""only"" severely impacts chronically ill or elderly Americans, so the average American shouldn't worry

In case the President and his allies have forgotten, let me remind you: elderly and chronically ill Americans are still, well, Americans. Our lives matter every bit as much as those of our healthy neighbors. And in a nation where, according to the CDC, six in 10 American adults live with at least one chronic disease, the potential impact of a highly communicable virus is much larger than one man's reelection chances. Government officials have an obligation to not only implement policies that keep Americans as a whole safe in the face of potential pandemics but also take every step necessary to make sure that disabled and chronically ill people are shielded from the harm those policies might cause them.

Thus far, Trump and his coronavirus ""task force"" seem largely focused on staging PR events designed to limit the President's political exposure. Trump appeared confused about the differences between vaccines (which would help prevent the spread of the virus) and therapeutic medications (whose purpose is to treat those infected with the virus) during last Monday's bizarre roundtable event with pharmaceutical executives, for example, which only highlighted just how little he understands about the situation.

But elected officials in Washington should be focused on taking steps to proactively limit the very real harm that could come to disabled and chronically ill Americans -- who the Trump administration has acknowledged are most at risk -- as the coronavirus continues to spread.

Congress has primarily focused on funding for the coronavirus response, passing an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill, which Trump signed into law Friday morning. The bipartisan bill, which was more than three times the size of the Trump administration's initial request, is certainly a critical part of the coronavirus response by federal, state and local health officials. But the funding bill does little to address the specific risks that chronically ill Americans face in the event of the coronavirus spreading.

Those risks are not limited to the coronavirus itself. In fact, some of the preventative measures the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued could inadvertently harm America's most medically fragile citizens unless steps are taken immediately to mitigate those dangers.

Chief among them is the impact of social distancing -- which includes avoiding large gatherings or public transportation, for example, in an effort to slow the spread of contagious diseases.

If the United States health care system becomes overwhelmed with coronavirus cases and social distancing measures are implemented, millions of chronically ill Americans who rely on one or more prescription medications need access to an emergency stockpile. The CDC's guidance for normal preparedness recommends Americans ""keep at least a 7 to 10-day supply of prescription medications,"" although some health care professionals are currently recommending patients obtain a 30-day supply whenever possible.

This represents a huge problem. Most payers (including Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance companies) have restrictions on how often they will cover the cost of refilling a member's prescription medications, often limiting patients to 30-day supplies with a short two- to three-day window for refills prior to a medication running out. These payers will most likely cover the cost of an emergency supply of medications only if forced to do so by law -- a law that Congress can and should take immediate steps to implement.

Further complicating things, millions of Americans (myself included) rely on controlled substances to manage chronic pain and other health conditions such as anxiety and ADHD. Due to increasingly restrictive state and federal laws on Schedule II, III and IV drugs in America -- including opioid pain medications and those meant for the treatment of anxiety disorders -- obtaining these medications frequently requires monthly doctor visits and urinalysis tests, and the medications often cannot be purchased in advance at all. Not only are these medications crucial for maintaining basic quality of life for millions of Americans, many of them also carry the potential for severe withdrawal symptoms that are worsened by a patient stopping the medication cold turkey, putting patients at severe risk in the event of social distancing measures preventing their refills.

Even if strict social distancing measures are not implemented in America, requiring chronically ill patients -- who are often immunocompromised -- to physically visit their doctors' office to obtain their monthly prescriptions while the coronavirus is still active in America puts those patients at higher risk of coming into contact with an infected person, increasing the chances of the virus continuing to spread and putting all of us at higher risk.

Under the Public Health Service Act, some of these issues could be addressed under the authority of the secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. In January, Azar declared a public health emergency nationwide in regard to the coronavirus. Under this declaration, Azar has the authority to waive many of the restrictions and requirements relating to the dispensing of prescription medications.

But his authority as it relates to private health insurance companies is limited. Even if Azar waived the restrictions and requirements on dispensing opioids, the issue of how millions of Americans who rely on private health insurance would cover the cost would be left to Congress to solve. And given the Trump administration's focus on increasing restrictions surrounding opioids -- and Trump's frequently stated desire to make drug laws even harsher -- it is unlikely that Azar would exercise this right.

In the meantime, it's clear that Americans cannot afford to wait around for the Trump administration to take action. Congress must move to pass legislation that allows for the adjustment of prescription medication laws in the event of an emergency such as the coronavirus. If social distancing begins to be implemented, it is critical that the government allow patients to obtain a 30-day emergency reserve supply of their prescription medications, temporarily waive requirements for patients to attend in-person doctor visits and urinalysis tests, and require that both government and private health care payers cover the cost of a small emergency supply of all prescription medications.","I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me","Congress has primarily focused on funding for the coronavirus response, passing an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill, which Trump signed into law Friday morning.

653,https://us.cnn.com/2020/01/30/africa/south-africans-stranded-wuhan-intl/index.html,"(CNN) South Africans in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, have expressed frustration about their government's lack of evacuation plans from the city.

Nearly 60 million people are under partial or full lockdowns in cities in China as the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread across Asia and the rest of the world . At least 170 people are dead, and more than 7,700 cases have been confirmed in mainland China since the outbreak began in December.

Several countries, including the US and Japan, have flown hundreds of their citizens out of the city.

South African Pieter Viljoen, who traveled with a colleague to Wuhan for a business conference before the city's transport lockdown began, said the authorities in South Africa and its embassy in Beijing have not provided support or information about plans to repatriate them.

South Africa's embassy in Beijing also declined to help when his company made private arrangements to secure a flight to get them out of the country and requested assistance and documentation to begin their evacuation process, he says.

Viljoen said dozens of South Africans caught in the city's lockdown have also complained about the South African government's lack of communication in a WeChat group created to share information about the situation.

""We are not getting any real assistance. The only information from the South African embassy is that we must comply with local authorities. In terms of leaving Wuhan, there has been no effort or communication about evacuation,"" Viljoen said.

Viljoen said he has remained in his hotel, which has shut down operations partially since the movement restriction put in place to help check the spread of the deadly virus.

Supermarkets and grocery stores around his hotel in Wuhan's Optics Valley area are running out of supplies, he said.

""You have only these small supermarkets where you can get food right now because of the complete lockdown. You can't move around from one district to another, so supplies are not readily available,"" Viljoen told CNN on telephone.

South Africa's embassy in Beijing declined to comment on Viljoen's allegations and directed CNN's request for comment to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO).

The embassy had closed on January 26 for the Lunar New Year holiday and full operations only resumed Thursday, according to DIRCO . Emergency contact numbers manned by embassy staff were available for citizens in need of assistance to call during the holiday, the department added.

DIRCO spokesman Clayson Monyela told CNN on Thursday that the South African government and its health ministry was working on all requests. However, they must also consider travel and quarantine measures imposed by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of the virus.

""We are not ignoring their plight, and we are quite aware of the need for speed to assist our citizens in Wuhan. We are liaising with the mission in Beijing to see how we can respond to the situation within the present context,"" Monyela said.

South Africa's opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which said it was in touch with more than 100 South Africans in China, called on the foreign ministry to address the ""dysfunction"" at the county's embassy in China, which it said had affected efforts to help stranded citizens.

""The Department needs to ensure that its mission is able to communicate and allay fears by providing clear and helpful communication and assistance at the same standard of other countries that have heeded the call,"" it said in a statement Wednesday.

Uncertain future

Despite growing calls for repatriation, South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday said there were no plans to fly its citizens out as Chinese authorities have the outbreak under control.

""The Chinese government has assured us that there is no evidence to necessitate the evacuation of foreign nationals living in Wuhan city, and they have called for calm in this respect,"" Mkhize said.

He added that they have been assured by the Chinese government that foreign nationals who fall sick will be treated in the same way as Chinese citizens.

South African Jessika Bailing says she feels neglected by her country's government.

The 23-year-old English teacher, who moved from South Africa to Wuhan last year, said while many countries are racing to get their citizens out of the city, authorities in South Africa were reluctant to make such arrangements.

""I've watched other countries' governments go above and beyond to evacuate their citizens and then we are faced with that kind of response from our government, how can one not feel abandoned?"" Bailing said.

""The South African government may be putting things into place or trying to find some solutions to get the South Africans in Wuhan evacuated but neither me nor any other South African I have been in contact with feels that they are,"" she added.

Dustin Emslie says he's disappointed by the South African government's response to the situation.

""I didn't really expect the government to evacuate us, I just hoped there would be more concern for South African citizens abroad,"" he said.

Emslie, who has lived in Wuhan for six years, said he would leave with his Chinese wife and 3-year-old daughter, only if the whole family will go.

""If I had to leave, it would only be if they could come with me to South Africa. There is no way I'm just going to abandon them here,"" he said.

He says while locals and expatriates have been trying to cope with the restrictions. The uncertainty about when the lockdown will end has been the hardest to bear.

""We have no idea when this epidemic will end. It could be months that we are under lockdown here in Wuhan,"" he wrote in a text message.

#KenyansinWuhan

Many Kenyans trapped in Wuhan have also taken to social media under the hashtag #KenyansinWuhan asking their government to evacuate them from the city.

A Kenyan student at the Wuhan University of Technology, who wanted to stay anonymous due to his status as a foreign student, said he now fears for his safety as the coronavirus death toll continues to rise.

""Imagine not being able to open the door to a friend because you don't know if they are infected; it is freaking me out,"" he said.

He also said that buses, taxis, and ride-hailing apps were not working, and the only way to get around was on foot or by bicycle.

Antony Waigwa, a Kenyan student at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan told CNN that Chinese authorities have been providing free food and electricity for many students at the institute since the lockdown.

State-owned telecoms company China Unicom has also given access to free internet services so that students can communicate and inform authorities about any development while the movement restriction lasts.

""Insurance companies have also removed limits to our cover so we can get treated till we fully recover if we contract the disease,"" Waigwa told CNN.

In a statement sent to its citizens living in China on Tuesday, the Kenyan embassy in Beijing said that the Chinese authorities had assured foreign governments not to panic and evacuation was not necessary at this stage.

The repatriation process could also take two weeks as Chinese authorities will only facilitate evacuation when foreign nationals have met all quarantine processes, including 14 days of no contact with the virus, the statement said.

It added that though the coronavirus outbreak is ""severe"", the embassy was confident in the Chinese government's efforts to contain it.

The spread of the virus has prompted some airlines to cancel flights to China , and several countries have placed people traveling from Wuhan under quarantine.

The Ivory Coast put a student who had returned from Beijing with coronavirus symptoms under observation on Saturday pending her test results.

The Nigerian government on Thursday said it will begin screening Chinese nationals traveling to the West African nation for the virus. Ethiopia and Kenya have placed passengers returning from areas hit by the virus under isolation. The World Health Organization on Tuesday said there had been no confirmed cases on the continent.",South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation,"(CNN) South Africans in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, have expressed frustration about their government's lack of evacuation plans from the city.

1085,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/live-stock-market.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin vowed on Friday that the United States government would do whatever was necessary to ensure that markets have Ã¢ÂÂalmost unlimitedÃ¢ÂÂ liquidity. He said that the economic relief package being negotiated with Congress was just the beginning of efforts to stimulate the economy in the wake of the coronavirus.

Ã¢ÂÂI think weÃ¢ÂÂre like in the second inning of getting things done,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC.

The Trump administration is considering additional relief measures, including a payroll tax holiday. Mr. Mnuchin also said that the administration is working on exemptions from tariffs imposed by President Trump that are affecting businesses, and that he would be open to waiving restrictions on withdrawals for 401(k) investments so that people can more readily access their savings.

The Treasury secretary dismissed rumors that markets could shut down because of the recent volatility, and he encouraged banks to turn to the Federal ReserveÃ¢ÂÂs discount window for funding if needed.

Mr. Mnuchin expressed optimism that the current Ã¢ÂÂblack swanÃ¢ÂÂ period would be over in a matter of months, and pent-up demand would jump-start the economy.

A split in Congress: Who should be paid not to work?

A fundamental divide over how many Americans should be paid to stay home from work amid the coronavirus outbreak has emerged as one snag in negotiations over a multibillion-dollar federal response to the mounting health and economic damage from the virus.

House Democrats are set to vote Friday on a bill, negotiated with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that includes several measures meant to combat the spread of the virus and cushion its economic shock to the economy. One of those is a plan to provide paid leave to workers affected by the virus.

A key question is how many workers should be covered by that leave plan, which would ensure compensation for people who do not go to work during the outbreak. Many Republicans want to keep it focused narrowly to workers who have contracted the virus or are forced to care for sick family members or children whose schools have closed Ã¢ÂÂ and they are concerned that the bill, more broadly written, could also encourage healthy people to stay home, thus chilling economic activity.",Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin vowed on Friday that the United States government would do whatever was necessary to ensure that markets have Ã¢ÂÂalmost unlimitedÃ¢ÂÂ liquidity.

588,https://us.cnn.com/2018/01/31/health/meaning-of-life-wisdom-project/index.html,"This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan .

It's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- both philosophically and practically, in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we rarely, if ever, stop to really think about the answer.

Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous.

And having an answer may even improve your health and help you live longer.

After studying 1,300 subjects from ages 21 to more than 100, the authors found that older people were more likely to have found their life's purpose, while younger people were more likely still searching. That's logical, given that wisdom is often born from experience. According to research by Stanford education professor William Damon, the author of ""The Path to Purpose,"" only 20% of young adults have a fully realized sense of their life's meaning.

And according to the new study, the presence of meaning in one's life showed a positive correlation to one's health, including improved cognitive function, while searching for it may have a slight negative effect. Mental and physical well-being was self-reported, and having a sense of purpose tended to peak around age 60, the study found.

than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered. According to two other studies published in 2014 -- one among 9,000 participants over age 65 and another among 6,000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives lived longerthan those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.

The connection to longevity could be causal -- having purpose may help one cope with daily stress , as other research has shown -- but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.

Or as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is quoted as saying, ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how,"" nicely summing up the connection between having purpose and forbearance in one's life.

Starting an annual meaning of life resolution

The easiest but perhaps healthiest resolution you could make in the New Year may be to simply ask yourself what the meaning of life is for you. What gives you purpose? Why are we all here?

Every January for more than two decades, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question.

The reason I ask it annually is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time.

Great thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is ""to serve others and to do good,"" and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, ""The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity."" And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, ""if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.""

Scottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, ""The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit."" And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to ""throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.""

""Love"" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, ""The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.""

My favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, ""The purpose of life is a life of purpose.""

Some have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. ""There is not one big cosmic meaning for all,"" AnaÃÂ¯s Nin wrote in her diary. ""There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.""

I agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. ""Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded,"" wrote Antoine de Saint-ExupÃÂ©ry, well-known for his book ""The Little Prince.""

Taking a few moments to record your answer to the question ""what is the meaning of life?"" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life.

And then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding.

In 1997, my answer was ""the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss,"" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make ""the world a better place."" In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply ""Love."" And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic ""continuation of one's DNA to the next generation."" But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others.

Subscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.

As a practical matter, if you want to do the annual ""Meaning"" exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.

The last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If ""love,"" is the answer, then love more. If it's ""find your bliss,"" then get searching for it.

476,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/02/business/bumble-bee-tuna-new-package-good-catch/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) It may not seem like the best time to be in charge of Bumble Bee.

The canned tuna industry has faced all manner of scandals over the past several years. Along with its competitors, Bumble Bee was implicated in a price-fixing scheme four years ago. Bumble Bee agreed to plead guilty for its role in the conspiracy and to pay a $25 million criminal fine. And last year, the company filed for bankruptcy , blaming its ""recent and significant legal challenges."" It has since been acquired by FCF, a Taiwanese fishing company.

The industry has also been plagued by criticism over its fishing practices, which have unintentionally netted dolphins and other marine life. It has also faced claims of human rights violations along its supply chains.

Bumble Bee is coming out with new packaging and new products this year. Its old logo, seen here, will get a makeover.

And Americans are eating less canned tuna. According to a 2018 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, annual per capita consumption of canned tuna has been falling steadily for decades, from 3.7 pounds in 1990 to 2.1 pounds in 2018.

But Jan Tharp, Bumble Bee's CEO since 2018, says things are looking up.

""We are super excited about our future,"" she told CNN Business.

Over the past year and a half, she said, Bumble Bee has been working behind the scenes to revitalize its business. Now, the company is ready to reveal some of its efforts, including new products, a sleek, updated design and a partnership with a plant-based tuna company.

New products and a new look

Bumble Bee is chasing customers by revamping its own image.

For too long, Bumble Bee failed to keep up with the times. New products and new packaging can help, said Tharp.

Tuna should be on-trend, she argued. It's a good source of protein that is low in calories and free of sugar. ""There's absolutely no reason why the category should be down,"" she said. Overall, she said ""the industry can do a better job"" of selling its product.

Younger eaters ""don't like status quo,"" said Brian Choi, managing partner and CEO at the Food Institute, a food industry news and market research company. ""They're looking for bolder flavors,"" he added.

To better connect with today's consumers, Bumble Bee spoke to about 10,000 customers over the course of a year, Tharp said, to get a better sense of what they're looking for. They kept those insights in mind when developing new products and packaging.

Bumble Bee is rolling out new products, and bringing a version of its ""Bistro Bowl,"" now sold in Canada under the Clover Leaf label, to the United States.

This year, Bumble Bee plans to start selling new microwavable ""bistro bowls,"" low-calorie meals containing tuna, vegetables, and rice or pasta. It is also rolling out new ""protein-on-the-run"" snack packs, with crackers, a sea salt caramel chew and tuna in olive oil and zesty lemon, black pepper or sweet jalapeno. And it's launching nine flavors of tuna in pouches, equipped with a spork so people can eat on the run, as well as a similar product in an easy-to-open can with a clear lid.

The company has already been selling tuna in pouches, and the format is performing well. Sales of the product popped 40% by volume in 2019, according to the company.

In addition to launching new flavors and packages, Bumble Bee is rolling out a new, nautical look. Gone is the chef-bee mascot, which can be found peeking over labels on some cans and pouches.

The new packaging calls out the amount of protein per container, features images of the ingredients lending flavor (like onions and chili pepper) and has new messaging. One pack reads ""bee well for life,"" positioning the product as a health food.

In addition to revamping its own image, Bumble Bee is partnering with a plant-based tuna company to attract new customers.

Moving in on plant-based tuna

Beyond Meat BYND Interest in plant-based alternatives to animal products has exploded. The trend kicked off with dairy substitutes, like soy and almond milk, and has been gaining steam with meat substitutes popularized by Impossible Foods and

Many expect plant-based seafood to be the next big thing. Tharp agrees.

""Seafood is coming,"" she said. ""Our customers are looking for that type of option.""

Bumble Bee had been looking for ways to get into the plant-based space for years, said Tharp. But it was having a hard time developing plant-based seafood on its own. So it decided to go into business with Gathered Foods Corporation, which owns plant-based seafood company Good Catch.

Bumble Bee plans to help with Good Catch's sales and distribution through the joint venture.

Good Catch makes plant-based tuna out of legumes.

The partnership is a ""win-win,"" said Tharp. It should help Good Catch scale, and give Bumble Bee a way into a potentially lucrative market. Barclays has predicted that the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion in sales within the next ten years. And the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports plant-based businesses, wrote in a 2019 report that plant-based seafood could ""potentially exceed growth rates in the broader plant-based meat category.""

The Good Catch deal may also help convince customers that Bumble Bee is serious about sustainability.

People who are concerned about meat's environmental impact may have similar concerns over fish. Lost or discarded fishing equipment contributes to plastic waste in the ocean and poses a threat to marine life. Plastic pollution could be dangerous for people, too, if microplastics end up in our food supply. Sustainability is a concern among young people especially, noted Choi.

""We do understand and share the concern regarding the impact of plastic in the ocean, especially as it relates to the pollution aspect of it as well as human health,"" said Tharp. ""We do take that subject extremely seriously, and we know that there's a lot of work and research that still has to be done.""

Bumble Bee is working with the National Fisheries Institute and Michigan State University to support research in the area, she said, adding that it has also joined the Global Ghost Gear Initiative, which aims to remove fishing debris from the ocean.

The company is also working to mitigate its impact on the ocean and marine life by tracing where its products come from. It is also is working with third-party auditors to try to enforce better conditions on fishing boats and in factories, Tharp said.",New packaging and plant-based fish: How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback,"New York (CNN Business) It may not seem like the best time to be in charge of Bumble Bee.

403,https://us.cnn.com/style/article/china-beijing-silvermine-negatives/index.html,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

For the last decade, Thomas Sauvin has been purchasing discarded color negatives by the kilogram from a recycling plant outside Beijing. The old 35-millimeter films capture family outings, weddings, birthdays, vacations -- anonymous, everyday memories that would otherwise be lost.

The trader he buys them from, Xiao Ma, usually dissolves the negatives in acid, alongside hospital X-rays and old CD-ROMs, in order to extract the small amount of silver within. But instead, Sauvin takes them away in big rice sacks to find out what else they contain.

Quite how the negatives found their way into people's trash remains a mystery to the French collector and artist. But with the help of a local technician, he scans them in batches before adding the images to his archive.

His ongoing ""Beijing Silvermine"" project paints a compelling picture of a country undergoing profound change. The collection -- which comprises 850,000 photos -- offers an ordinary perspective on life in China that is often overlooked, said Sauvin, who lived in Beijing for over 12 years.

""The way China was depicted through contemporary photography, propaganda and journalism (offered) a portrait far from the one I was witnessing,"" he said in a phone interview. ""There was something more universal, something about collective memories, that started emerging. The photos show a side of China that was never really exported to the West.""

While the resulting images can be, at times, inexplicably surreal (an old man standing in a cacti bush, or a woman posing next to a fake shark), they are often mundane. Yet, after spending a year and half ""looking for gems,"" Sauvin realized that the strength of his archive lay not in occasional humorous discoveries, but in the bigger picture that emerged.

Most of the images were taken between 1985 and the mid-2000s, when the widespread adoption of digital cameras made film largely obsolete. It was a time of rapid economic development, and the photos show how this played out in people's lives: families posing with new household appliances or standing with statues of Ronald McDonald after fast food arrived in China in the early 1990s.

The pictures also document people's changing relationship with the medium of photography, as cameras went from expensive luxuries to everyday items.

""I have one (roll of) film -- 36 images -- that was shot over three-and-a-half years,"" Sauvin said. ""You have three consecutive birthdays of the same person. You can imagine, on very important occasions, the parents would bring out this analog camera, take one photo and then wait six months before taking another one.

""But by 2005, as analog photography becomes (more affordable), you notice that people would go to somewhere like the Summer Palace and take 36 photos in 30 minutes.""

Recurring themes

What remains consistent throughout this period, however, is the pictures' composition and what Sauvin calls ""the ritual"" of photography. Almost all of the images show subjects standing at the center and looking out to the camera.

Some common themes also emerge: women posing with flowers, twins dressed in identical clothing and people interacting with statues or public sculptures. Indeed, the collector found so many photos of people smoking at weddings (Chinese brides would often light cigarettes for male guests as thanks for their attendance) that he was able to publish an entire book of them.

New ideas constantly emerge from the collection. Sauvin's latest exhibition brings together photos from a Beijing amusement park filled with miniature replicas of famous world monuments, from the Kremlin to the Eiffel Tower. Opened in 1993, Beijing World Park encouraged visitors to collect a stamp from each landmark in a mock passport (""Go around the world in just one day,"" its catalog boasted).

What initially appears as a vintage oddity, however, tells a wider story about the country's rise. The exhibition juxtaposes photos of people next to replica landmarks with those of Chinese tourists in front of the real thing. In doing so, he explores how an evident curiosity about the outside world was satiated by the newfound income to holiday around the world.

""It seems to be quite a meaningful place,"" Sauvin said of Beijing World Park, which remains open to this day. ""It was like an educational place for people to start understanding what traveling and tourism was all about.""

Fading memories

Sauvin has become adept at deciphering where, and in what circumstances, old photos may have been taken. But it took seven years for a subject to ever identify themselves in one of his pictures.

The image in question depicts a middle-aged man laid out on rocks beside a lake (""like a mermaid,"" as the collector put it). It was a personal favorite of Sauvin's, and thus had appeared in exhibitions, posters, flyers and even as a sticker. Indeed, he had spent so much time looking at the man's image that he ""knew the guy like he was my grandfather.""

After Sauvin posted the photo on China's Twitter-like microblogging platform, Weibo, a user recognized the subject as his ex-girlfriend's father. Some messages later, the artist met the man at a Beijing restaurant in 2016 -- almost 30 years after the photo was taken by colleagues at an engineering conference.

""He was very happy, and we had a very good time,"" Sauvin said. ""In the end, I offered him a framed copy of the photo and he asked me to sign it. He looked at his wife and said, 'In a couple of years that's going to be worth a lot of money!'""

Although now based in Paris, Sauvin still visits Beijing four or five times a year. The recycler Xiao Ma calls whenever he has recovered enough negatives for a 50-kilogram bag. The price has almost tripled in the decade since the project began, rising from 28 yuan ($4) a kilogram to a ""still very reasonable"" 75 yuan (just under $11).

""It's always a bit of a gamble, because sometimes a 50-kilo bag only comes from one source -- and if that source isn't interesting, then I've just spent 400 Euros,"" he said. ""But that's part of the game, I suppose.""

The supply of negatives may soon run dry. Xiao extracts the most silver from X-rays, but Sauvin said that Chinese hospitals have gone digital, making the trade far less lucrative. But Sauvin also sources negatives from eBay-like websites and visits flea markets, which is where he stumbled across his latest project: old prints hidden in a plastic bag.

""I asked the vendor if I could open it and check inside,"" Sauvin recalled. ""And he said, 'No, you have to buy it.'""

He took the risk. After parting with around 450 yuan ($64), Sauvin looked inside to reveal a series of black-and-white photos depicting athletes mid-leap, their gravity-defying poses assuming an almost sculptural quality.

Sauvin's latest project brings together found photos of athletes from a single day in 1960. Credit: Courtesy Thomas Sauvin

Further investigation revealed that the pictures had been taken by the photography department at Xi'an Physical Education University, in China's Shaanxi province. All had been shot in a single day in June 1960 -- at the height of Mao's Great Leap Forward, the disastrous modernization campaign that plunged the country into economic chaos and famine.

""I've never managed to find a significant number of photos from this era. People were obviously not going to photo studios, because it was a very hard time,"" said Sauvin, who has compiled the images into a new book, ""Great Leaps Forward.""

He said that the economic relief package being negotiated with Congress was just the beginning of efforts to stimulate the economy in the wake of the coronavirus.

Ã¢ÂÂI think weÃ¢ÂÂre like in the second inning of getting things done,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC.

The Trump administration is considering additional relief measures, including a payroll tax holiday. Mr. Mnuchin also said that the administration is working on exemptions from tariffs imposed by President Trump that are affecting businesses, and that he would be open to waiving restrictions on withdrawals for 401(k) investments so that people can more readily access their savings.

The Treasury secretary dismissed rumors that markets could shut down because of the recent volatility, and he encouraged banks to turn to the Federal ReserveÃ¢ÂÂs discount window for funding if needed.

Mr. Mnuchin expressed optimism that the current Ã¢ÂÂblack swanÃ¢ÂÂ period would be over in a matter of months, and pent-up demand would jump-start the economy.

A split in Congress: Who should be paid not to work?

A fundamental divide over how many Americans should be paid to stay home from work amid the coronavirus outbreak has emerged as one snag in negotiations over a multibillion-dollar federal response to the mounting health and economic damage from the virus.

House Democrats are set to vote Friday on a bill, negotiated with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that includes several measures meant to combat the spread of the virus and cushion its economic shock to the economy. One of those is a plan to provide paid leave to workers affected by the virus.

A key question is how many workers should be covered by that leave plan, which would ensure compensation for people who do not go to work during the outbreak. Many Republicans want to keep it focused narrowly to workers who have contracted the virus or are forced to care for sick family members or children whose schools have closed Ã¢ÂÂ and they are concerned that the bill, more broadly written, could also encourage healthy people to stay home, thus chilling economic activity.",Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin vowed on Friday that the United States government would do whatever was necessary to ensure that markets have Ã¢ÂÂalmost unlimitedÃ¢ÂÂ liquidity.

This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.

(CNN) With Tuesday's announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Pelosi has finally put constitutional duty above perceived political expediency.

House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently slow-played the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding Ukraine scandal

Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's own admissions and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump suspended $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.

Trump and his defenders claim his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump stated Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it."" But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection? Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries?

Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was ""very friendly."" That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid.

Trump also claims he exerted ""no pressure"" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could.

And Trump claimed, ""NO quid pro quo."" But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the ""this for that"" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own original statement, made clear he equates ""corruption in Ukraine"" with ""investigate Biden"" and little else: ""All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son.""

So, what crimes could Trump be violation of?

Foreign election aid -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to ""solicit, accept or receive"" a ""thing of value"" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged (""solicited"") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.

While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a ""thing of value."" And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a leading contender to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?

Bribery -- it is illegal for a public official ""directly or indirectly"" to demand, seek, receive or accept any ""thing of value"" in return for ""being influenced in the performance of any official act."" Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding ""influence in the performance of an official act"" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself has drawn that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out ""corruption."" Trump has made clear that he equates ""corruption"" with the Biden investigation.

Extortion is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially ""I'll help you, if you help me,"" while extortion is ""I'll harm you, if you don't help me."" The suspension of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.

Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office.

But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.

JUST WATCHED Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry 01:04

Impeachment need not be based on a crime. The Constitution prescribes impeachment for ""treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be drawn from English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.

The Constitution separates impeachment from criminal prosecution. Draft articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to abuse of power for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine).

This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.

Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi is now changing course on impeachment.

By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

Now, your questions

If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of ""urgent concern"" and (2) ""credible,"" then he or she ""shall submit"" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- reviewed the complaint and found that it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.

But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI concluded that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not ""a member of the Intelligence Community"" and the conduct did not ""involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision."" In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President.

That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.

That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.

Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?

Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution explicitly grants the House the ""sole power of impeachment"" and the Senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments,"" with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.

In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus was impeached and convicted on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.

Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?

As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have openly contemplated utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact, nobody has ever been fined by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama convincingly argues that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.

While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will ""fight all the subpoenas,"" he likely would fight all the fines. Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up.

Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, ""Make me."" Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.

Three questions to watch

1) Will Pelosi finally see the light and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment?

2) Will House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff take the intelligence community whistleblower case to court?",Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday.
Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine.
By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

Since 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes

Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book ""United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.""

(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.

Because 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.

But Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.

In fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.

In other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.

294,https://us.cnn.com/2015/10/19/politics/planned-parenthood-videos/index.html,"Costa Mesa, California (CNN) David Daleiden wanted to show exactly what a 19-week-old aborted fetus, being held in the hands of a medical technician, looked like. The problem was he didn't have that picture. So he went to the Internet, found something close and inserted it into his documentary.

The photo, two cupped hands holding a tiny male fetus, appeared on screen as dramatic music played. Against this backdrop, a medical technician detailed how she was present when an intact 19-week gestated fetus was aborted at a Planned Parenthood clinic and, she says, harvested for tissue samples.

Daleiden's video failed to mention that the photo and the story do not match.

Abortion photo actually stillborn child

The photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic. It was the stillborn child of Alexis Fretz, whose son was stillborn in 2013. Fretz took the photo and posted it on the Internet to memorialize the son she named Walter.

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

Without Fretz's knowledge, Daleiden and his two-man documentary group called the Center for Medical Progress plucked that photo from her web page and dropped it into his anti-Planned Parenthood documentary.

""Was it clear?"" Fretz asks herself in a CNN interview, ""No it was not clear. Was it deceitful? I don't know that.""

Daleiden told CNN the fact that the photo is not an actual photo of an aborted fetus makes no difference. He insists the fetus is the same age as the one referred to in his film, and he used it only as an illustration.

Misleading video cited in Republican debate

Daleiden also is being criticized for a second, potentially misleading use of video that has found its way into the Republican presidential campaign. GOP candidate Carly Fiorina cited a portion of the Center for Medical Progress videos in which an intact fetus kicks its left leg and moves an arm shortly after being aborted.

Fiorina described the video during CNN's Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential library on September 16, using the horrific image in her call for an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

In an interview in Southern California earlier this month, Daleiden now admits he has no information on where the video was actually taken. There is no evidence it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

Daleiden says the image came from an outside source, an anti-abortion group called the Center For Bioethical Reform and he doesn't know its origin beyond that. A spokesman for the group tells CNN it won't disclose the location either, only that the video in question was paid for. Despite its source, Daleiden again insists the video is only used as an illustration of what an intact aborted fetus would look like, not the actual fetus referred to in his film.

Critics call videos heavily edited, discredited

The two examples of misleading pictures and video have allowed Planned Parenthood and its supporters to label the Center for Medical Progress's entire production a fraud.

Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president with Planned Parenthood, repeated the defense the women's health group and its many supporters have been trying to convey since the first of the Center for Medical Progress's nine videos began to be released online.

""All of the tapes and footage David Daleiden has released out into the world has been heavily edited,"" Laguens told CNN. ""And I think pretty thoroughly discredited.""

Daleiden insists the two uses of video and photos are not misleading, and says the entire controversy has been manufactured by Planned Parenthood and its ""allies in the mainstream media"" in order to divert attention from the main point of his documentary: that Planned Parenthood uses aborted fetal tissue as a revenue source.

Planned Parenthood ends payments

The Center for Medical Progress spent several years taping Planned Parenthood employees, medical directors and some of its affiliate partners discussing the technique, costs and reimbursement payments for the harvesting of fetal tissue samples for scientific research.

The filming was done without knowledge of those speaking. In several instances, CMP argues that Planned Parenthood representatives appear to be bargaining, negotiating and detailing the best ways to collect or ""harvest"" aborted fetuses for maximum financial gain.

In one episode, Dr. Mary Gatter, a medical director for Planed Parenthood, is filmed during a meal discussing her proposal that each tissue sample harvested should fetch a $75 charge.

Since selling fetal tissue samples is illegal, Planned Parenthood has been quick to label the transactions as reimbursement costs and that they were made only at a tiny fraction of the organization's 700 clinics and affiliates. Planned Parenthood executives continue to claim the videos are heavily edited, taken out of context and deceptive.

But last week Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement costs at any of its clinics for the transfer of fetal tissue-samples. In a letter to the National Institutes of Health, Planned Parenthood's president defended her organization and insisted all transactions in the past were legal. But says the new change in policy was being taken ""...in order to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.""

Contacted after the announcement, Daleiden says the sudden change in policy is an admission that he and his videos were right.

""If the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts were truly legitimate 'reimbursement,' why cancel it?"" Daleiden wrote in a statement to CNN. ""This proves what the Center for Medical Progress has been saying all along -- Planned Parenthood incurs no actual costs, and the payments for harvested fetal parts have always been an extra profit margin.""",The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"Abortion photo actually stillborn childThe photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

470,https://us.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/musk-vertical-farm/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

Vertical farming is an indoor farming method in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases.

While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk , who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming.

""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email.

Kimbal Musk teaches students how to plant a vegetable garden in California.

""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center.

Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" Ã¢ÂÂ with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale Ã¢ÂÂ in less than three months.

Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries.

The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space.

""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report.

It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.

As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University.

Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.

Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable.

Basil growing at the Square Roots farm in Brooklyn.

""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.

At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly.

Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy.""

Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks.""",Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

I belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over Ã¢ÂÂ the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.

Yet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution.

Paul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever

Sixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , ""The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history.""

Nearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever

Paul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.

In the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)

I'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.

Dasha Burns: Millennials have an existential crisis

Don't hate us -- we're just confused. We've seemingly made "" changing the world "" with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).

Dasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.

But in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.

This is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.

Of course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.

We're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.

So, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.

We're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.

Dasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.

Pepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation

For me, it's a tale of two cities.

One city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.

Pepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.

Most of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.

But there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a ""cocktail,"" general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.

Our generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.

John Sutter: Hmm, identity crisis...

At 33, I'm a young-ish-but-sorta-old person with a generational identify crisis. I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X. I can quote ""Reality Bites,"" a staple of the 30s to 40s set, but I also use Snapchat.

I'm both and neither. Generation-adjacent. Floating in time.

John Sutter's selfie at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2013, after he finished a reporting trip down the San Joaquin River in California.

I think people in my situation -- the youngish-sorta-getting-older set -- define ourselves mostly in terms of what we're not. Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of ""trend piece"" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment. We millennial-adjacents may seem wayward and indecisive -- but we're light years ahead on all those issues.

It's the boomers holding us back. I mean -- it is, right?

Donna Brazile: We got Steve Jobs and Oprah Winfrey

I'm a proud baby boomer. That's my generation, marked by the proliferating of our parents or grandparents after they returned from World War II.

Donna Brazile at the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington in 1983, which she helped organize.

From the beginning of the 1900s to about the mid-'60s, generations had romantic names: the lost generation, the greatest generation, the silent generation, the baby boomers. Then someone hiccuped and historians went generic: gen X, gen Y and gen Z.

If I were a member of generations X, Y or Z, I'd be miffed. Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all ""me, me, me,"" and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.

For all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Ã¢ÂÂ has to be considered the best. But I am sure some of my friends in the millennial generation would likely say the best is yet to come. Go ahead. Prove me wrong.

Paul Callan: Gen Ys and millennials, stop whining

We baby boomers grew up watching small black and white TVs that carried only four networks that went off the air at midnight. Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.

In school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't ""helicopter"" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.

Paul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.

In 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.

At work, there were ""typewriters,"" ""carbon paper"" for making copies and ""white out"" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented. You had to get it right the first time or you would look like an idiot to the judge because of all the white out on your document. Public telephone calls were made from ""phone booths"": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.

Cigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.

People who owned cars put ""No Radio"" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.

In 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting. A serial killer called ""Son of Sam"" was still on the loose that night. But we survived.

We boomers are tough, resilient, hardworking and creative. Instead of whining, we invented rock 'n' roll.

Matthew Segal: What's holding us back?

Debating which generation is better or cooler is a popular but futile exercise. It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.

Matthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.

To a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.

The cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.

Maybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.

Sarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress

The real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.

Millennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.

Sarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.

We are the most diverse generation in American history. We are also incredibly progressive.

We are creative and have used our ideas to make new things. Boomers invented the Internet, generation X improved it, and millennials found how to bring people closer through it. Even though we join all other generations in hating the nonsense that is the U.S. Congress, we remain optimistic that government can be used as a tool to help people, or, if you're a ""Daily Show"" fan, something to laugh at.

Like those who came before us we're neither better nor worse, good nor bad. We're different, and we bring different experiences and understanding to the table. There's no competition. We're in the same boat trying to do what we can with what we've got to make a better world.

Christian Louboutin is CNN Style's new guest editor . He's commissioned a series of stories around the topic of ""Journeys.""

Far from the jewelry workshops of Paris and the showrooms of the world's most rarefied auction houses, a capital of sparkle has developed in the American southwest.

Each winter, some 65,000 visitors descend on Arizona for the Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase to admire and acquire shiny new pieces to brighten up their lives. With thousands of vendors setting up shop and 50 separate shows around the city, it's less an exclusive experience than a cosmic jumble sale where nothing is too large or too ostentatious to catch somebody's eye; and nothing is too unusual to lure in curious passers-by.

While diamonds and precious stones hold a place of honor, there's no shortage of oddities for sale, from animal pelts and skulls to personalized rubber ducks. Over the course of a single day of this year's showcase, which ran from January 30 to February 14, photographer Daniel Arnold saw a $70,000 geode ""the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,"" a baby goat being led around a parking lot by a cowboy, and enough tie-dye to rival a Grateful Dead concert.

""A proper, polished gem show takes over the convention center, and the rest of the city becomes Its swap meet parking lot,"" Arnold said. ""It's an idyllic post-apocalyptic scene, like a very fun version of the end of the world.""

More than 7,300 coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout South Korea, killing more than 50. It is one of the largest outbreaks outside mainland China, where the deadly virus was first identified. However, the number of new daily infections in South Korea has declined in recent days.

Park said that while he believes the aggregate number of infections is high, he is confident in the job South Korea did to combat the virus' spread and would advise other governments who are dealing with outbreaks to focus efforts on early testing and global cooperation.

The South Korean government has been among the most ambitious when it comes to providing the public with free and easy testing options. It has the ability run about 15,000 diagnostic test per day and has conducted 196,000 tests to date nationwide, free of charge. Authorities in the city of Goyang even set up drive-thru testing booths.

He's pleased that his protege and close friend Adam Silver, the current NBA commissioner, on Wednesday night showed the world what bold, intelligent leadership looks like when he announced the league would suspend the NBA season, after one and then two players -- Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz and later teammate Donovan Mitchel l -- said they tested positive for the coronavirus.

After the players' diagnosis, Silver didn't hesitate to make the right call for the NBA, and the right call for America. For me, Silver's decision is a sobering but inspiring reminder that true commitment to social responsibility means that capitalism doesn't always have to mean profits over people.

Within hours of the NBA's decision, other sports leagues followed suit . Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League all took action. MLB called off spring training and delayed its season, MLS suspended play for 30 days, and the NHL suspended its season. The NBA announcement caught many in the sports world by surprise, including a few NBA players -- among them Lakers star LeBron James, who tweeted

""Man we cancelling sporting events, school, office work, etc etc. What we really need to cancel is 2020! Damn it's been a rough 3 months. God bless and stay safe""

But shocking or not, the NBA Ã¢ÂÂ where the average team is valued at more than $2 billion Ã¢ÂÂ showed America a commanding leadership that sadly has been absent as we watch our President Donald Trump, pundits and politicians (on both sides of the aisle) send citizens dangerously confusing messages about the virus and how we can protect ourselves.

Under Commissioner Stern, the league was never afraid to confront important social issues , especially about inequality and injustice in America. Long before it was trendy, Stern initiated a nearly two-month long campaign that included television segments, short Black History Month specials, school and community events with NBA players to celebrate the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr. And that leadership continued under Silver, who has been vocal on LGBTQ issues, going as far as moving the 2017 NBA All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina , after that state's opposition over the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" -- a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people that was widely criticized as discriminatory.

And in stark contrast to the NFL and how it handled Colin Kaepernick's police brutality protests, Commissioner Silver offered unconditional support to NBA players who protested and spoke out against the police killings of unarmed black men and women along with the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

""Part of the reason NBA players are more active is that it's been part of the culture of this league for generations and passed down to them,"" Silver told CNN in 2018.

It was disappointing, but not surprising , that the often-maligned National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hesitated to suspend the college basketball season. But you see, it's March Madness Tournament time in college. And March Madness is a cash cow for just about everyone associated with college sports, except the players, who get paid zilch.

There's no doubt the NCAA Ã¢ÂÂ with more than 1,200 member schools that have student populations that range from the hundreds to the tens of thousands Ã¢ÂÂ is responsible for a much larger population than the NBA (30 teams with 15 to 20 players). But for me, that doesn't preclude the organization from taking a clear leadership role to try to protect its players in the best possible way from the coronavirus health crisis. And ultimately agreeing to cancel March Madness and other winter and spring sports is a good decision.

While athletes are paid nothing, in 2019 alone, the NCAA earned $933 million from media rights fees, ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and advertising sales around the three-week-long tournament.

JUST WATCHED What's life in a locked-down Milan like as a sports journalist? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What's life in a locked-down Milan like as a sports journalist? 03:44

Off the court, fans filled out tournament brackets and wagered $8.5 billion on March Madness.

The highly watched March Madness games are a boon for television networks, who all compete for broadcasting rights. In 2016, CBS and Turner Sports paid the NCAA an additional $8.8 billion to extend their March Madness rights through 2032. Their original deal, from 2011-2024, had cost over $10.8 billion. (Turner Sports is owned by CNN's parent company.)

Initially on Wednesday, the organization announced an eyebrow-raising plan to confront the pandemic health crisis. It said the tournament would go on as scheduled, but fans would not be allowed to attend the games. Instead, the games would go on with select family members, staff and game officials allowed in the arena. To many observers, it was as if NCAA officials hadn't been paying full attention at all to the warnings and safety measures put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I mean exactly what did the NCAA envision happening? Players would use a Clorox wipe to disinfect the ball every time it was passed to them? Or, that no one would touch their face to swipe sweat from their eyes? Good grief. Anyone who's ever bounced a basketball will tell you that's impossible.

But unlike professional sports leagues, where highly paid athletes are protected by players unions and sports agents, especially when issues of player safety are concerned, college athletes must do as the NCAA demands.

So most sports fans know to give the side-eye to any and all NCAA decisions, when it comes to issues of player safety and profits. And sadly, the NCAA's stumbling toward a decision to cancel March Madness on Thursday only served as a reminder that the organization cannot be trusted to protect players.

Regardless of what many fans believe, student-athlete life is not easy. It's often not even fun -- the missed holidays and summer vacations with friends and family, the nearly impossible demands of trying to keep grades up while spending most of your days in the gym, or on the road going to games. It's exhausting.

No doubt, millions of college athletes are disappointed by the way the season has ended -- in basketball and many other spring sports now being canceled as campuses close or move instruction online. I know many are crushed that all their sacrifices to play sports have come to this sad ending and I am sad for them. It feels incredibly unfair. We teach our kids about self-sacrifice and being good citizens, but it's a bitter pill to swallow when we are called upon to make those sacrifices in such stark terms as the ones unfolding right now.

March Madness is my favorite time of year. Call me sappy but the tournaments remind me of the power of the human spirit to rise to our greatest challenges. We dream of Cinderella teams winning out over big-moneyed programs. We look for David and Goliath epic battles and stories of redemption. Watching March Madness makes me feel like a kid again.

Sports has been my sanctuary. The place I go to forget my worries and beat back my fears for a few hours. As a student-athlete, a fan, and later a sports journalist, I have had sports as my constant joy. But today, it feels like there is no sanctuary from the chaos. We awake each day to renewed fears of the coronavirus and toxic political talk.

1200,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676,"Image copyright La Voix du Nord Image caption Toilet queues spurred Nathalie Des Isnards to start her company making women's urinals

A few years ago, Nathalie Des Isnards was attending a music festival with her husband David, and planning to watch her favourite group.

Before the show, they headed to the toilets. ""I spent 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pee,"" she recalls. Much to her frustration, she missed the first part of the concert.

Meanwhile David took just ""two minutes"", and saw the whole show.

""I was upset. I told myself, 'We're in the 21st century, something should be done about that.'""

She set about creating a women's urinal. The simple seatless basin she devised is housed in a cubicle with roof and door, designed for faster use but also privacy. ""I was not a designer. I was a user first,"" says the 46-year-old.

Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

However, thanks to social media, and growing competition between event organisers, she thinks the issue is getting more attention.

""[It] forces them to offer better services,"" she explains. Also, organisers now realise, when women are queuing, they're not spending money.

Des Isnards says 100,000 women used madamePee last year, at 15 events across France, including the Women's World Cup. ""It fits all women, not only young ones open to innovation.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption MadamePee hopes women's urinals will lead to shorter queues at events such as festivals and marathons

Two units have been also been installed in Paris as public amenities, she says. This year the loo will be in several other countries.

""The ambition is very clear. It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,"" says the French entrepreneur.

Even newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.

Copenhagen-based architects, Gina PÃÂ©rier and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.

""It's just insanely more efficient,"" says Ms PÃÂ©rier, 25.

The idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival. ""I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,"" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. ""There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.""

Image copyright Eric Delafosse Image caption Lapee is 'insanely more efficient' say its creators

According to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate.

The team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.

Getting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. ""We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,"" she tells me.

Lapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.

Ms PÃÂ©rier says Lapee is also targeting, ""public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.""

The start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year.

They're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.

More Technology of Business

Other urinal products have launched with varying success.

Perhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up.

Sam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.

""The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,"" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further.

Mr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.

Gail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.

""It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,"" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.

""Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption Research suggests women take up to twice as long to use toilets

Women typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned.

""We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,"" Ms Ramster says.

""Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.""

Researchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times.

But the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women.

""For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,"" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. ""This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].""

It could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them.",Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

418,https://us.cnn.com/style/article/malaysia-1mdb-najib-zunar-fahmi-reza-intl/index.html,"Zunar and Fahmi Reza's art was a boon to protesters sick of the alleged corruption of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it nearly landed the two men in prison.

Also instantly recognizable is the artist behind the picture, which has pride of place at an exhibition in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur. Political cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Haque, better known as Zunar, has spent most of the last decade lampooning Najib and Rosmah, even as the risks for doing so grow ever greater.

Zunar's work welcomes visitors to ""Democracy in Action,"" a recent exhibition that would have been impossible to stage only a year ago. In one cartoon, a hand holding chopsticks marked ""China"" reaches over to pluck Malaysia off a platter marked ""1MDB scandal."" In another, a huge diamond ring, a handbag and a bag of cash come together, Transformers-style, to form an image of Rosmah.

At the center sits Zunar's motto: ""How can I be neutral ... even my pen has a stand.""











1 / 6 Zunar has faced considerable restrictions on his work in the past. Credit: Zunar

That motto has been severely tested in recent times. Just last year, it seemed almost certain that Zunar would end up in prison. A number of his books had been banned, and while his work was still widely shared online, the artist faced multiple charges of sedition and committing acts deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy."" Unknown assailants attacked him at a gallery show, police seized his works and he was banned from leaving the country.

Then, in a shock election result, a coalition of opposition parties turfed Najib out of office, promising to clamp down on corruption and reverse the country's turn toward authoritarianism.

Now Zunar is watching as his the political figures who were once his nemeses and muses face decades behind bars themselves -- in part because artists like him helped bring attention to their alleged corruption and disdain for the rule of law.

Zunar tells CNN that it's his mission to save Malaysia. Credit: James Griffiths/CNN

""The medium of cartooning is (a) very powerful medium,"" Zunar told CNN at his small studio in a Kuala Lumpur suburb. ""Everywhere, in any country you go, (cartoonists) get killed. Cartoonists, get arrested, put in jail everywhere because of the medium.""

Fellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.

""Using satire and humor is effective because it breaks the fear barrier,"" he said in a phone interview.

""People had always been afraid to speak out. The culture of fear is always there; the culture of self-censorship is always there. That's where satire and humor can be the most effective tool, it makes people less afraid.""

Cartoonist's muse

After a number of false starts, Zunar's career as a political cartoonist was flagging when his nemesis emerged on the political scene in the 1990s.

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Najoib's wife Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Credit: Zunar

In many ways, the artist's career trajectory rose in tandem with that of Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers who climbed quickly through the ranks of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, initially as deputy prime minister and then to the premiership itself in 2009.

As Najib's star grew, so did the frustration of his critics. Detractors delighted in seeing him brought back down to Earth by Zunar's increasingly exaggerated, grotesque portrayals.

More even than Najib however, Zunar found his muse in Rosmah. He did, however, face more difficulty publishing cartoons of her, versus those of the Prime Minister.

""When my book came out with Najib on the cover, I could at least release it,"" Zunar said. When Rosmah was the subject however, ""the police came and stopped the launch ... (from this) we can understand that maybe that she is more powerful.""

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When police raided the couple's properties in Kuala Lumpur last year, they seized jewelry and gemstones worth over $109 million. Around $13 million worth of HermÃÂ¨s handbags were also confiscated, along with cash and other goods totaling over $100 million.

Many of the items were, allegedly, purchased with money embezzled from the 1MDB state investment fund, set up by Najib. Rosmah has pleaded not guilty, and due to numerous delays in the legal system, has yet to end up in court.

The 1MDB scandal -- and Rosmah's spending -- became a central theme of Zunar's work. In particular, the artist sought to make a connection between the allegedly embezzled funds and the Malaysian people: One cartoon showed Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal's waste.

""Zunar has such a finely developed sense of what is right and what is fair,"" said Robert Russell, executive director of the Cartoonists Rights Network International. ""Like any good political cartoonist he has this well-developed sense of righteous indignation.""

Russell said Zunar's cartoons were so effective, in part, because they undercut concerted efforts by the government to present itself, particularly overseas, as a legitimate and clean administration. Using a combination of journalism and art, Zunar highlighted the instances where this was not the case.

But doing so would ultimately endanger his freedom, as Najib's government took a hard authoritarian turn in an attempt to stifle criticism.

Clowning around

Beginning in 2010, Zunar was questioned multiple times under the Sedition Act , a colonial-era law widely denounced by human rights groups as draconian.

In 2016, he was charged with taking actions deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy"" over a series of cartoons depicting government corruption. Police seized hundreds of his books, and unknown assailants attacked him at an exhibition.

Later that year, Zunar was slapped with a travel ban after he visited Geneva to accept the Cartooning for Peace Award. The ban, according to free-speech group IFEX, ""appear(ed) to be an attempt to damp down the growing international publicity (surrounding) Zunar and his work.""

Zunar was not the only artist to face blowback for satirizing Najib. In June 2016, Fahmi Reza was charged with two counts of violating section 233(1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, which forbids disseminating online content deemed to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass others.

Fahmi had depicted Najib as a clown with big red lips and arched, thick eyebrows. The image quickly caught on with Malaysians sick of the widespread allegations of corruption, and it soon became a common sight at anti-government protests.

Like Zunar, Fahmi had a record of trouble with the authorities. In 2004 , he designed a poster for a demonstration against police brutality, and volunteered to help print and distribute leaflets and other materials.

Unfortunately for him, Fahmi's conscientiousness was his downfall. Arriving ahead of most other protesters, police saw him with a large number of posters and banners. He was quickly arrested.

""I panicked and I was afraid,"" Fahmi told CNN. ""But I think surviving that made me bolder, knowing that the poster I made was having an effect on these people who abused their power.""

When he was arrested again in 2016, Fahmi was ""fully prepared,"" he said.

""One sign that whatever you're doing is effective is when the authorities and people in power react,"" he added. ""If they ignore it, then there's no impact. That's how the whole clown thing became a symbol of protest -- because of the overreaction by the authorities.""

Satire as a weapon

Both cartoonists' arrests made international headlines, helping to highlight Najib's growing authoritarianism to the outside world. Protesters also delighted in using the caricatures of Najib and Rosmah on posters and placards after it was revealed how much the artists had irritated them.

As Malaysia's opposition grew ever more determined to oust Najib -- with many observers warning that 2016's general election might be their last chance to do so -- the government passed new legislation to control what people could say about it.

In early 2018, it introduced a new law to crack down on ""fake news"" that critics said was so broadly defined that it could easily be used to shut down and criminalize criticism of Najib.

Eventually however, the wave of dissent was too great for Najib to overcome. Even though the electoral map was redrawn in his favor, he lost heavily. With an 82.32% turnout, an opposition coalition led by current Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad took 121 of 222 seats. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition won just 79.

Uncertain future

Since Najib's downfall, charges against Zunar and Fahmi have been dropped, though the latter is still fighting to have an earlier conviction overturned.

Both men said that, while they felt considerably freer under the new government, true reform has yet to be delivered.

""(The government is) more tolerant toward online dissent and criticism -- and even insults,"" Fahmi said, despite the fact that the ""online content"" law used to prosecute him is still on the books.

""People know it's still there, so I think some people are still afraid to voice their criticism openly,"" Fahmi said.

Zunar said the new government's most important task is to ""repair the damage"" done by previous regimes. He is willing to give them time to do so, but as for the future, ""we don't know yet.""

Russell, of Cartoonists Rights Network International, said Zunar faces a situation similar to that of other dissident cartoonists when their former oppressors leave office.

In the last year of Najib's rule, Zunar was banned from leaving the country. Credit: Zunar

""Even with Zunar's heroes ... now in a new government, he's going to start drawing the same cartoons about them,"" he said. ""This is not necessarily a happy ending. If Zunar is true to his roots, he will be as ruthless with the new government as any (other) government.

In the short term, Zunar is facing a more pressing concern: the loss of his muse, Rosmah.

While she has largely disappeared from Malaysia's political scene while her husband attempts to reinvent himself as a man-of-the-people government critic, the former prime minister's wife remains present inside Zunar's studio, her cartoon face staring up from numerous books and picture frames.

""I miss Rosmah,"" the artist said. ""For me, she was a god send. Very easy to draw, very cartoonable. Her character is very cartoonable.

""As a cartoonist, I miss her. When Trump goes one day, American cartoonists will miss him too.""",Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak,"Zunar and Fahmi Reza's art was a boon to protesters sick of the alleged corruption of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it nearly landed the two men in prison.
Fellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.

(CNN) To date, over 125,000 cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported worldwide -- with more than 4,000 fatalities. Over 1,400 cases have been reported in the US alone, a number that will surely grow in the coming weeks. Miraculously, though, our country's prisons and jails, many of them unsanitary environments, have yet to experience an outbreak.

But that will likely change, and soon. ""We know that at some point we're going to have a case,"" said Patty Hayes , director of public health for Seattle and King County, Washington, this week, referring to a potential coronavirus case in local jails.

It isn't a matter of if, but when. And when the inevitable takes place, it could have a deadly impact.

Of the 2.3 million incarcerated people in the US, roughly 165,000 are over the age of 55. And compared to the general population, people in jail and prison are more likely to have preexisting health conditions such as high blood pressure, asthma, cancer, arthritis and infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C and HIV. We're still learning about the coronavirus, but what we do know so far is that these two populations are most at risk of falling ill or dying from it.

If ever there was a time for our elected leaders to stand up for people behind bars, it's now.

(CNN) In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.

This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.

And a third party that makes it its raison d'etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.

Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up -- and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we're usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren't good enough.

The immigration disconnect

Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders --that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.

As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.

Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted : ""Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it's time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.""

What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters -- or who had read recent polls -- was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.

According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.

But this was a Democratic primary -- the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?

No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn't. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.

Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.

What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?

The politics of extremes

This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.

On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.

Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in ""the Squad"" -- Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley -- get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.

A so-called "" alterna-squad ,"" a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I've heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, ""Well I can't vote for Trump, but I'm not with those guys, either.""

In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that ""finding common ground"" is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence ""a decent guy."")

Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most ""divisive.""

The silent middle majority

Take abortion. ""[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,"" according to Pew . Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us -- the majority -- agree it should be legal but with restrictions.

Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.

A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn't those voters feel betrayed by that?

Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties' willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.

While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don't , what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.

Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally -- a path to legal status -- if they meet some requirements over time.

And as it turns out, that's what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we're to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.

So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?

Legislative solutions aren't profitable

Here's the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn't as politically profitable as keeping them broken.

Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.

Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.

JUST WATCHED Avlon: Our polarized Congress can't address problems Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Avlon: Our polarized Congress can't address problems 03:10

As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to ""own the Libs,"" and Democratic voters are happy being ""the resistance,"" it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.

Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.

Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.

All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That's likely only going to get worse.

A party by the middle and for the middle

A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn't be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn't take this position or that one, and it wouldn't have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.

For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican -- a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew , a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.

That third party would also lean pro-abortion -- keeping Roe v. Wade in place -- but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.

It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn't, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.

It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.

In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn't on either extreme. There wouldn't be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn't have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.

One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can't, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.

Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.

There's also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.

So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.

Finally, whether an alternative party in today's age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn't swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn't designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one's blood pressure almost instantly.

Because let's face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America's future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we'll all be politically homeless eventually.",SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of "" SE Cupp Unfiltered .""

502,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/10/europe/italy-coronavirus-beniamino-pagliaro-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The whole of Italy has been put on lockdown , as the government desperately tries to gain control of the coronavirus spread.

On Tuesday, thriving cities like Rome, Milan and Venice became ghost towns . Italians are facing a new reality of life with a curfew, travel restrictions and enforced space between people in public places, as the country reports more than 9,000 infections and more than 630 deaths.

CNN spoke to Beniamino Pagliaro , a journalist for national newspaper la Repubblica, who described the measures as unprecedented.

What are you seeing on the streets?

I'm in Rome, and the streets are basically empty. Rome is pretty famous for traffic jams, but there are none at the moment, there is very little traffic.

Like in many offices, most people (at Repubblica) are working from home. Many of our colleagues have children and schools are closed. People were told to work from home for health reasons first, but there just isn't anywhere for children to go.

I live in the Trastevere, and there is a joke about the area, that one in two people are tourists. On a normal day, you can hear lots of people talking in English or Russian. These days, you don't see tourists at all.

In the past week, I've been to Milan, and also there you can feel the city is half-closed. Restaurants are empty.

But don't get me wrong, I think the government was right to choose these rules.

Journalist Beniamino Pagliaro warns other countries may face a similar situation to Italy's soon.

How are people responding to the measures?

They are listening. If you watch how less crowded the cities are, you can tell that something has changed,

Most people are trying to cancel travel. Many friends are canceling trips back to their families' homes. Some friends of mine who live in Rome or Milan, they often go home to stay with family, but their parents are older, so they're canceling because the risk is higher for older people.

People are communicating a lot on social media, sharing what TV shows they're watching, what books they're reading.

People are mostly staying at home with their children. They can go for a run outside while gyms are closed, and some people are meeting in small groups.

I'm not proud to say this, but when (Prime Minister) Conte announced the new measures -- the lockdown of the entire country, bringing the whole country to the same level as Lombardy -- at that moment, some people panicked and there were hundreds of people running to supermarkets in the night to buy things. I'm afraid we are still very irrational in these kind of things.

But this happens in London, Berlin and New York, it's not just Italians.

What is it like looking from the inside to the outer world?

This is a really tough situation. I wrote a story this morning about how it's very worrying and scary to me, that most capitals around the world seem not to have understood how deep a change we need.

Reading news of the UK and United States, what they are doing is what we were doing two weeks ago. The pattern is very, very clear, like you are in denial because you think you can act in another way, but then facts and scientists tell us the only way is to slow down -- you cant stop it -- but slowing down the virus will mean a lot less problems in your hospitals.

In Italy, we were lucky to experience the outbreak in an area with plenty of hospitals like Milan, because if you had this spread of the virus in southern Italy, for example, it really could be a mess.

I know that some parts of the UK and some parts of the US especially are not very well-equipped. In the US, there's also a known situation about healthcare costs.

How do you describe this moment?

So it's a tough moment but also it may force everyone to do the right thing.

Of course, it could be boring to postpone events or travel, but then the good thing in this spread of the virus is that people will understand that we are used to thinking about ourselves. While this spread is happening, it's very clear we are not alone, and so you have to think about the whole of society.

If you put together all the populist movements in the recent years, it was all about ""me wanting this"" and ""me wanting that."" British people who want to be isolated, or to remain -- this makes very clear that the world we live in, we cannot just count just on ourselves, we are together.

THE GREAT OUTDOORS

Though Japan might be most famous for its dazzlingly modern cities, you'll want to spend at least a few days exploring its stunning natural offerings. This is a nation that truly has it all, from rocky mountain peaks to white-sand beaches.

Here are few Japan experiences that will allow for both relaxation and adventure.

Winter sports

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

Nagano, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998, has long been a snowy escape for global travelers. But in recent years, Niseko on the northern island of Hokkaido has become another leading destination for powder hunters thanks to its fresh, quality snow and amazing food scene.

Down on the island of Honshu, meanwhile, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture offers skiing, onsen (more on that later) and ""snow monsters.""

For something completely different, the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route , dubbed the ""Roof of Japan,"" offers travelers a chance to drive down a highway framed by massive walls of snow that tower as high as 17 meters over the road.

Beach hopping

It's easy to see why this stunning Iwate prefecture beach was named ""Jodogahama,"" or Pure Land. JNTO

Being an island nation, Japan's beach offerings are just as impressive as its skyscrapers and bullet trains.

In the north of Japan's main island, Jodogahama Beach (Pure Land in English) is a tranquil hidden beach with crystal-clear water and stark white rocks.

If you prefer softer (and darker) sand, Ibusuki Beach is your dream destination. The subtropical beach is famed for a unique activity -- sand bathing, or suna-mushi.

For island hoppers, you can check out a series of 260 tiny pine tree-covered islands in Matsushima.

Onsen soaking

For anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm. It's the rule.

The word ""onsen"" refers to Japan's natural hot springs but it also can represent facilities like spas and inns that pipe the waters into their own bathing areas.

Though thousands of onsen exist throughout the country, Beppu is Japan's hot spring capital -- and for good reason. It's home to more than 2,500 hot springs and is the world's second-largest source of thermal spring water.

For travelers with ink, however, stripping down at a Japanese onsen can get tricky as many ban tattoos, which have been associated with yakuza gangs.

Fortunately, there's Tattoo-Friendly , a website featuring properties that allow ink. Users can narrow down the search by choosing the type of facility they want to visit -- gym, pool, hotel-and-ryokan (inn) or sento (public baths).

Each listed property includes a brief description of the place and its amenities, as well its specific policies on tattoos.

Hanami

For just a few weeks every spring, Japan celebrates an annual ritual known as hanami: stopping to view and appreciate the beautiful spring blossoms.

It's so popular the Japan Weather Association's annual sakura (cherry blossom) forecast is broadcast live on TV, while the Japan National Tourism Organization has a regularly updated timetable of cherry blossoms predictions on their website.

Hiking

Being a mountainous nation, trekking is an extremely popular Japan activity.

For a spiritual journey, try Kumano Kodo , a multiday pilgrimage across Wakayama prefecture -- fueled by great food, cute rural villages and rich culture along the way.

More than a thousand years ago, imperial leaders and aristocrats made their way to the main Kumano Kodo shrines through a network of hikes across the island. At the end of the hike we recommend spending the night at a temple in the mountaintop town of Koyasan , the center of Shingon Buddhism.

Here, ancient cedar forests share space with historic pagodas, paved roads, restaurants, schools, cafes and souvenir shops.

The enchanting Yakushima forest (the setting for Hayao Miyazaki's epic film Princess Mononoke) on Kyushu island and the Sagano bamboo forest on the outskirts of Kyoto are other family-friendly places to enjoy a quiet walk in Japan.

TRADITION

Japan excels at striking the right balance between tradition and modernity, leading the way in technological advances while also embracing its past, whether it's architecture, art, fashion, food or sports.

Here are a few experiences that will give you a taste for Japan's traditional side.

Stay in a ryokan

Looking for that classic Japanese inn experience, complete with tatami floors, onsen and sliding doors?

Staying in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese guesthouse, is the way to go. Catering to all budgets, they can be found throughout Japan -- most commonly in the countryside outside of urban centers.

Guests are encouraged to wear yukata (house kimonos) and socks, while traditional Japanese meals are prepared in-house.

Tea ceremonies

CNN's Paula Newton travels to Fukuoka and the surrounding tea-rich lands to experience the traditional winter tea ceremony.

The Japanese tea ceremony, or chado , is a traditional way of preparing and serving matcha (top quality green tea).

To make it, green tea leaves, grown in the shade, are dried and ground into a fine powder. This allows the tea to retain its nutrients. During the ceremony, which focuses on the rituals and mental states achieved in the process, the powder is whisked with hot water in a small bowl until a slight foam appears.

The top place to experience Japan's matcha tea ceremony -- or just enjoy a few cups of the precious drink -- is Kyoto. There are plenty of tea making classes and demonstrations available in English and other languages.

Kimonos

Japan's most beautiful traditional attire, kimonos are undeniably an expensive souvenir to bring home. One reason for their hefty price tag is the painstakingly detailed process that goes into making them.

Another reputable kimono-making company is Okaju in Kyoto, founded in 1855 and now helmed by the fourth generation Shigeo Okajima.

If you'd simply like to don one during your Japan visit, there are a number of rental companies throughout Kyoto.

Prefer to appreciate these beautiful garments from afar? Kyoto's Gion district is where travelers can view graceful geishas, traditional Japanese entertainers, walking down the street in their kimonos.

Sumo watching

Sumo is as ancient as it is quintessentially Japanese. Historians agree that the sport dates back at least 2,000 years, and in its current form has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period.

But scoring a seat at one of Japan's six major sumo tournaments per year might as tough as getting into the ring and wrestling yourself, though with a little advance planning you can make it happen. Tickets are available through Japan's official sumo website

There are other ways to get close to a sumo wrestler.

When they're not competing, sumo wrestlers train year round in designated sumo stables, or beya.

These stables, which are mostly based in Tokyo's Ryogoku neighborhood, are where the city's wrestlers live, eat, sleep and practice on a near daily basis. In recent years, it's become more common for foreigners to visit the morning practice, which begins at about 5 a.m. and lasts three to four hours.

CUISINE

Japan is a culinary wonderland thanks to its unique heritage, a national obsession with food and an almost religious embrace of freshness and perfect production.

Here are a few of the country's must-try dining experiences. Been there, ate that? For a deeper dive into the country's culinary wonders, check out our list of 25 top Japanese dishes

Sushi

l e v a r t

Chances are, sushi is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think ""Japanese food.""

More than just a slice of fish over vinegar rice -- that is only one type, called nigiri -- mastering the art of sushi can easily take a lifetime. Luckily, there's Sushi University , where travelers can learn to distinguish nigiri from nori-maki.

Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.

Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.

If you're up for a splurge, Sushisho Masa (106-0031 Tokyo, Minato City,Nishiazabu, 4 ChomeÃ¢ÂÂ1Ã¢ÂÂ15) in Tokyo's Roppongi neighborhood is nothing short of perfection.

And then of course there's Sukiyabashi Jiro , the fabled restaurant in Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world. Hidden in a basement attached to the Ginza Metro Station, Sukiyabashi Jiro earned global fame following the 2012 documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi.""

Kobe beef

Only 3,000 cattle are classified as Kobe grade each year. ÃÂ©JNTO

Known for its pervasive marbling and melt-on-your-tongue texture, Kobe beef is one of Japan's most prized meats.

A type of Wagyu beef named after the region in which the cattle are raised, Kobe is relatively rare -- only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade.

This has caused a fair bit of confusion but here's an easy way to remember it. Wagyu (which literally means ""Japanese cow"") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline.

The Kansai region, where Osaka is based, produces the three ""king"" varieties of Wagyu: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty.

Soba

Want a seat at Kyourakutei? You'll have to wait in line. CNN meets up with the man behind this popular Michelin-starred Tokyo soba restaurant.

Soba, or Japanese buckwheat noodles, are usually served cold with dipping sauce (called zaru soba) or served hot in dashi broth.

Triumphing over them all is te-uchi, which means ""handmade,"" soba in Japanese. The hand-kneaded and cut soba offers the best firmness and, hence, is more much tastier than the mass-produced variety.

For a truly unique soba experience, head to Iwate, a prefecture in Japan's northeast where you can enjoy a 400-year-old all-you-can-eat noodle tradition called "" wanko soba .""

One wanko soba restaurant claims a diner ate 570 bowls in one sitting.

Yakitori

One of the best reasons to visit a pub in Japan? Yakitori, Japanese style chicken skewers. ÃÂ©JNTO

A yakitori restaurant is where you can sample every part of the chicken -- from chicken breast to skins to gizzards -- all presented on skewers, Japanese style.

Tokyo's Torikado is one of the best places to enjoy them. A high-end omakase yakitori restaurant, Torikado's diners will leave it up to the chef to decide what they eat.

Another popular way to chow down a few chicken skewers is with a beer at an izakaya, or casual Japanese pub. Here's our selection of the best (and affordable) izakaya in Tokyo

Kaiseki

Kaiseki meals were originally intended to be enjoyed before a tea ceremony.

Japan travelers researching a trip to Kyoto will inevitably come across the word ""kaiseki.""

To the outsider, it appears to simply be a multicourse Japanese dinner made up of beautifully plated dishes. But there's so much more to this meticulously prepared, exquisitely served and, usually, very expensive meal.

To practitioners of this haute cuisine, kaiseki is the embodiment of ""omotenashi,"" which means wholehearted hospitality.

Ramen

Ramen is the ultimate Japanese comfort food. ÃÂ©Hiroshima Prefecture/ÃÂ©JNTO

Nothing's more comforting than slurping back a bowl of ramen on a cold rainy day.

There are four basic styles of the world-famous soup-based dish: Shoyu (soy sauce seasoning); shio (a light soy sauce version of shoryu); miso (made with fermented soy beans); and tonkotsu (a creamy-white pork bone broth).

CNN Travel asked Brian Mac, founder of the blog Ramen Adventures , to share some of his favorite ramen varieties in Tokyo and beyond, which include Hokkaido's miso ramen, Kyushu's Kumamoto ramen and all kinds of shoyu variations. Read more about them here

Sake

A one-minute tour of Japan's northern Tohoku region, which produces some of the country's best bottles of sake.

Japanese rice wine, sake has a long-standing history dating back to the third century.

It's produced all over the country -- and many brewers are open to tours -- but Japan's Tohoku region in the northeast is where you'll find some of the best bottles.

Part of what makes Tohoku's sakes so different is geography: The winters are severe with heavy snowfalls and historically, because of its remoteness, agriculture has been the mainstay in Tohoku.

For visitors making the trip north, several breweries offer tours in English, as well as tastings -- but you will need to book in advance via their websites.",16 Japan experiences every traveler needs to enjoy,"Koichi Kamoshida/Getty ImagesFor anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm.

91,https://us.cnn.com/2020/01/06/opinions/india-citizenship-amendment-tewari/index.html,"Manish Tewari is a Member of Parliament representing Shri Anandpur Sahib Lok Sabha Constituency. He is a ranking member of the opposition party, the Indian National Congress and was a former Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) India witnessed one of the most melancholy moments in its recent past when the eminent historian Ramachandra Guha was dragged away by the Bengaluru police during the anti Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

His apparent offense? Participating in the right of dissent that is the holy grail of any constitutional democracy. Guha and others have rightfully taken a stand against the Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by the upper and lower houses of India's Parliament, which is vague and unconstitutional because it makes fast-tracked citizenship dependent on one's religion.

Watching Ramachandra Guha being taken away reminded me of his riveting exposition on why India is the most fascinating country in the world. The central thesis being how India had emerged as a religiously pluralistic society when most nations have defined themselves through a monotheist lens.

Indeed, India can be said to be a utopia that defines itself by the phrase ""unity in diversity."" I wrote in an earlier op-ed that ""out of a bloodstained Partition there emerged two ideas of nationhood -- a progressive, pluralistic and inclusive impulse that became the idea of the Republic of India and a theocratic template that became the idea of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."" Sadly the events playing out through the actions of the government depict a trajectory that is distinct from the vision of a pluralistic society.

India has been the birthplace of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, which add to its cultural smorgasbord. Even the Abrahamic religions have a unique history in India. Syriac Christians in India emerged shortly after Christ died and 600 years before Islam came into being. History records that Thomas the first, one of Jesus' 12 apostles, landed in Kerala to spread Christianity and today, he is buried in Tamil Nadu. The country today is host to a significant population of the Christian faith.

Islam came peacefully to the south and has a slightly more complicated history up north. Today, India has the second largest Muslim population in the world, despite not being an Islamic country. India is one of the few countries which houses members of the Jewish diaspora who have never faced any form of state-led persecution.

More interesting is the story of the Parsi community and their arrival in India. While fleeing religious persecution in Persia, they docked on Indian shores, in modern day Gujarat. Apocryphal tales have it that the King Jadhav Rana sent a bowl of milk filled to the brim, implying that he would not be able to accommodate them. The Parsis returned the same bowl of milk with sugar in it to convey that, just as the sugar had seamlessly mixed with the milk, they too would integrate effortlessly.

For centuries, India has assimilated, internalized, accommodated and embraced waves of immigrants, invaders, traders and preachers among others. The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 (CAB), coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) -- a register of all Indian citizens whose creation is mandated by the citizenship act of 1955, subsequently amended in 2003 -- is an assault on India's pluralistic ethos. It is an affront to the first principles of constitutionalism. It violates Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 25 and 26 and the basic structure doctrine now cast in stone in the 1973 Indian Supreme Court case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, which, by a slender majority, mandated that certain articles that form the core of the Constitution are beyond even the amending powers of Parliament.

In a secular nation like India, religion cannot be the basis of citizenship, whether territorial or extra-territorial. It also militates against the first principle of reasonable classification under Article 14 -- equals cannot be treated as unequals. You cannot make religion the determinant for granting refuge, asylum or citizenship.

The act seems to be testing the waters for a pan-India NRC that would make the citizenship of billions subject to the whimsical biases and ideological predilections of those in government today in New Delhi. Moreover, the Citizenship Amendment Act adopts different benchmarks for Bangladesh and Bhutan. The government's defense is that it is meant to protect persecuted minorities in its pan-Islamic neighborhood, specifically, non-Muslim minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

However, Maldives too is Islamic as per Article 10 of its Constitution. Yet, the bill does not extend the same privileges to minorities in the island nation as it does to those of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country, where the Tamil minority (largely Hindu) have long faced persecution at the hands of pro-Sinhalese nationalists. Why does the act exclude them then? What about Ahmadis, Shias, and Baloch in Pakistan? Yes, they're Muslim, but they have been under the shoe of Sunni hardliners, and hardships have been further exacerbated by the military establishment and the constitution in Pakistan that refuses to recognize Ahmadis as Muslims. There is also the case of persecuted Christians in Bhutan.

What would have been more magnanimous on the part of the government would have been comprehensive legislation that is holistic and welcomes all individuals fleeing persecution and not drawing arbitrary lines to gauge persecution based on religious denominations.

There are many shades of grey here and hence we need nuances separating illegal migrants from refugees and granting citizenship on a case-by-case basis in a non-discriminatory manner.

India is in uproar, in protest, in ennui, in disenfranchisement, in pain, in anger, in suffering. If this government cares about its image globally, then it knows that at this rate, it is in trouble. Good governments listen to the pulse of the nation and can diagnose pain points expeditiously. It's one thing for this government to have won an election decisively but today it's ability to govern is seriously in question.

India has stood the test of democracy, when all others around it became tin pot dictatorships run by the military. When imperialism and colonialism retreated across the world, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America, India was one nation that did not go under either totalitarian or one party rule, and never, ever under a military jackboot.

Aside from critically ill patients who are hospitalized, the physician said the Massachusetts Department of Public Health is only approving testing for people who have been exposed to someone who has already tested positive or who has traveled to one of the five heavily impacted countries outside the US in the past 14 days, which mirrors CDC guidelines.

""It's insanity,"" said the physician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

There are not even tests on hand to use if a patient was approved for testing, the doctor said.

""Even if the patient were around and exposed to someone coughing, sick, sneezing, I cannot give them a coronavirus test,"" the doctor said. ""We are being crippled by our department of public health and the CDC on our ability to combat this pandemic.""

The doctor said state and federal health officials ""need to loosen the criteria on testing"" and ""allow us doctors to use our discretion to decide who should be tested.""

As of Wednesday only 11,079 specimens had been tested in the US, paling in comparison to the more than 230,000 people tested in South Korea, which has about one sixth the US population.

As of 10 a.m. Thursday, there were 81 public health labs that are verified and offering testing for coronavirus, including at least one in all 50 states and Washington, DC, said Michelle Forman, a spokesperson for the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Forman said her association estimates the nation's public labs could run up to 10,000 tests a day.

A big jump in testing is needed to get through crisis, experts say

Infectious disease experts say more testing is critical to prevent the spread of the disease.

Dr. Rod Hochman, CEO of Providence St. Joseph Health, an organization of 51 hospitals and about 1,000 clinics, described testing capacity in the US as highly deficient.

""We're still not at levels where we need to be. This has been really slow to get started,"" said Hochman, who said his organization is currently relying on public lab testing but added that he's been in close contact with commercial diagnostic companies, which he believes will begin testing soon.

Hochman said the turnaround time on testing results has ranged from 24 hours to four days, which he called ""unacceptable.""

""Testing is so critically important because it helps us as clinicians figure out the extent of the spread. It has implications for how we care for patients and where we put them,"" Hochman said. ""It's unraveling the detective story of how the virus spreads but we are trying to do it now with no data.""

If cases of the disease are not identified quickly and community spread continues unchecked, it could soon overwhelm the nation's medical system, just as it did in Wuhan, China, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.

""Now, we're at the critical point where we have to have a big jump in testing and then quarantining and isolating individuals,"" in order to slow the spread of the virus, he said.

But the reality for many Americans is that they are asking for tests and being turned away.

Anger, frustration, fear: Patients describe testing rejection

Hilal Bayrak of Santa Clara, California, was among those who said he couldn't get the peace-of-mind a test might bring. He came down with a 104 degree fever and started coughing and wheezing about a week ago. He had been working alongside a co-worker who had just returned from Italy. The two shared a keyboard, he said.

His 4-year-old daughter first developed a fever and then a few days later, he and his wife came down with one. Last Saturday, they all went to the emergency room. Each tested negative for flu. Their chests were X-rayed. Same thing -- nothing alarming. Bayrak asked if they could be tested for coronavirus and he says was told that was impossible.

In order to be prioritized for testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that one must have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing as well as have been in close contact with a person known to have coronavirus. Or, they had to ""have a history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of their symptom onset.""

Bayrak appealed to ER workers, telling them about his co-worker's recent visit to Italy, a country that has all but shut down while authorities attempt to contain the fast-spreading virus.

It didn't work.

""I was angry. I was frustrated,"" he said. ""What's more surprising is that after we left the ER on Saturday they told me to follow up with them if my symptoms got worse. They did. My fever was persistent. I took Motrin, Tylenol every 4 hours. I started having continuous headaches. I had no energy. At the moment, I have a rash on my body.""

So the 40-year-old called the ER Wednesday and reported that. ""They told me the same thing. I cannot get tested.""

In Washington state, as many as 18 firefighters and paramedics who believe they were exposed to people who tested positive for the virus cannot themselves get tested because they have shown no signs of illness, several firefighters and public information officers told CNN.

""That's very concerning,"" said Gabe DeBay, a firefighter and paramedic in King County.

Dawn Clements has been sick since March 6. The 49-year-old lives in a Largo, Florida, assisted living facility because she suffers from health problems, including a compromised immune system.

Clements said her daughter, 16, suffered from a 103-degree fever and a burning sensation in her lungs two weeks ago, but tested negative for flu. Clements said she began experiencing similar symptoms after taking care of her daughter, and also got a negative flu test.

She says while her daughter has recovered, she has not. Neither has been able to be tested for coronavirus.

""I was told I didn't meet the criteria because I did not travel out of the United States to one of the countries (with spreading coronavirus). I don't know what virus I have. I'm running a fever and I have chest congestion, and nobody can test us here.""

You need to 'advocate for yourself'

Pinellas County, where Clements resides, is ""prioritizing testing,"" according to the state health department.

""It's a situation where the most likely to have Covid-19 are being prioritized for testing, and those are people who have been travelling overseas to an affected area or in close contact with a known Covid-19 patient,"" said health department spokesman Tom Iovino. ""We have lots of 'worried well' people who are just wanting to be tested. We are following the CDC advice, prioritizing testing.""

In some cases it's not the infected person who wants testing done, but the loved ones around them.

Shelby Koser, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mom from Minnesota, said she's worried about her dad, who suffers from asthma and has been battling a cough and fever. She said her 60-year-old father was diagnosed with bronchitis, but that she's skeptical.

""My dad does not normally get this type of sick,"" she said.

Koser said her father is ""too stubborn"" to ask to be tested for Covid-19, and that she and her mom are worried for his health and that of those around him.

""I've got two young kids,"" Koser said. ""My concern is that the government isn't testing enough people and that a lot of people already have it.""

Where testing issues started

The struggle some faced in getting tested in the US contrasts sharply with the experiences of patients elsewhere in the world.

In Australia, where testing is free and easily available, actors Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, learned they had come down with the virus.

Some of the people contacting CNN complained of symptoms and circumstances more severe than the ones publicly shared by the actors and said they were still denied tests.

The ability for public health labs to test for the virus was hindered last month when the CDC announced that some test kits shipped to labs were not working properly. The CDC announced it was remaking parts of them.

Lab directors and workers are upset by what they say is a lack of follow-up information from the CDC, said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He's spoken to lab directors and workers.

""From a morale and readiness perspective, labs were frustrated by the delays and the silence from the CDC,"" he said.

The Centers' rollout of lab testing ""didn't go as quickly and smoothly as we usually see,"" acknowledged Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director in an interview that aired Thursday with CNN's Sanjay Gupta.

She described the effort to get tests to public labs as ""a bit delayed"" but also blamed commercial labs, saying they were ""really slow to take this on and scale up.""

Now, weeks into the crisis, Schuchat said ""the jury's out on what exactly is the best way to roll out testing.""

""I've heard from colleagues in other countries about concern that there was so much testing going on that people with no symptoms and people who were not at risk clogged up the healthcare systems,"" she added.

Asked how easy it would be for someone to get tested who is showing symptoms, Shuchat told Gupta, ""Well I think an important thing is to be connected to the healthcare system to figure out if you need testing. You know, it may not be the best thing to go into a clinic and ask about that. It may be better to call.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was more direct in his remarks to Congress Thursday.

""The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it -- we are not set up for that,"" he said. ""Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not.""",Coronavirus test: confusion over availability and criteria is leaving sick people wondering if they're infected,"""Even if the patient were around and exposed to someone coughing, sick, sneezing, I cannot give them a coronavirus test,"" the doctor said.
""We are being crippled by our department of public health and the CDC on our ability to combat this pandemic.""
Forman said her association estimates the nation's public labs could run up to 10,000 tests a day.

866,https://us.cnn.com/2017/11/30/opinions/rt-foreign-agent-media-transparency-nossel-opinion/index.html,"Suzanne Nossel is executive director of PEN America. She was formerly executive director of Amnesty International USA and deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations at the State Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) RT -- the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as ""Russia Today,"" frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot , publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.

Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the ""Foreign Agents Registration Act,"" or FARA , a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.

Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.

The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the ""About Us"" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.

News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.

Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, ""The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda.""

In late October Twitter announced that it would ""off-board"" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.

Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.

While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.

In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.

With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.

If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.

We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.

In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.

Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.

It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself.",Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week.

For Niger-born architect Mariam Kamara, the 2018 Rolex Mentor and ProtÃÂ©gÃÂ© Arts Initiative presented her with a tremendous opportunity. The two-year program, which pairs emerging creative talents with masters in their field, saw her working under the guidance of British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye, and allowed her to realize her dream of designing an arts center in Niger's capital city, Niamey. But it also exposed her to her most formidable and outspoken critics yet: a group of high school students.

Though the West African country has one of the youngest populations in the world, literacy rates are low, so Kamara, who founded sustainable design practice Atelier Masomi in 2014, felt it was necessary to create a center that responded to their needs.

""What I had the privilege to do is to really allow (the students) to guide what this project becomes,"" she said over the phone. ""So before Rolex even saw a glimpse of it, I went through the much scarier task of showing it to them. I was nervous because I wanted to make sure that the things we talked about found their way into the design.""

The students told her they wanted a place to read and participate in the arts that reflect their identities as Nigeriens, while also looking to their future. To meet that request, Kamara unveiled her plans for an arts center that also houses an auditorium, a gallery and the city's first public library last year. Once completed (construction begins this summer), the Niamey Cultural Center will be a place for learning, creativity and community-building.

Like her previous projects in the city, the cultural center will be built using compressed earth bricks -- a breathable material responsive to Niger's desert climate and a reflection of local vernacular architecture. The design encompasses four 155-foot curved towers that not only help to cool the interior of the main building by creating facilitating natural ventilation, but also create shaded public courtyards and passages that are accessible to all.

""I know there are people who may not feel that they can enter this large structure because it's very intimidating. So I asked what it means to create space for everyone,"" she said. ""My answer is that it can't be just one big building... I am interested in a structure where you can have a promenade that allows you to be in the space without having to go in.""

The center's location along a valley -- between the French colonial part of the city where the wealthy reside and the side where the less well-off live -- is also significant. Kamara hopes the center will encourage disparate societal groups to come together.

Kamara left Niger to attend university in the United States in 1997. Originally qualifying as a computer scientist, in her 30s she decide to follow her passion for architecture and retrain at the University of Washington.

Though Kamara now splits her time between Niger and Providence, Rhode Island, it's her projects in her home country, blending contemporary and traditional influences, that have earned her the most acclaim and accolades, including the prestigious Prince Claus Award last year.

Her design for a market in the remote village of Dandaji, which includes colorful recycled metal canopies surrounding a sacred tree, has become a vital space for vendors in the region to do trade. And Hikma, the religious and secular complex she designed for the same village in 2018, saw Kamara transforming a derelict Hausa mosque into a library with the help of the adobe masons who originally built it, and created a new, larger mosque alongside it from materials sourced within a three-mile radius. The project was made in collaboration with Iranian architect Yasaman Esmaili, with whom she co-founded the global collective united4design in 2013. The two also co-designed the Niamey 2000 low-cost residential project in 2016.

Kamara said the limitations of working in a country with so few resources has forced her to hone her approach. ""There is something very useful about that scarcity. It clarifies your thinking. It really makes it about space rather than bells and whistles.""

""You cannot hide a bad space when you don't have access to shiny things,"" she continued. ""It becomes more about what the space is doing and how it is bringing people together. That for me is what architecture is about.""

She feels this is especially important at a time when construction has become a significant contributor to pollution in large cities. ""It's impossible to ignore all the climate-related issues,"" she said. ""We need to figure out what progress looks like when it's not fed by exploitation, and recognize our mistakes in terms of construction, material and resource-depletion. Now Asia, South America and Africa can be trailblazers. For me that means there is an opportunity to make a real contribution.""",How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger,"Written by Neo Maditla, CNNFor Niger-born architect Mariam Kamara, the 2018 Rolex Mentor and ProtÃÂ©gÃÂ© Arts Initiative presented her with a tremendous opportunity.

Photographer Elena del Estal couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the disease

(CNN) Imagine sitting on a dusty, busy street in New Delhi, crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market. A woman's lapis-colored sari swishes past you in the golden-colored dusk. You've been here since morning.

A tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill. You try to lift your hand to accept, but you can't. The muscles are paralyzed, and your mind can't command them to move. You use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee. Then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day.

This is everyday life for Bipin Kumar. Kumar, known as BK, contracted polio as a child, and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives. Kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him, so he moved to New Delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could -- begging on the streets.

Photographer Elena del Estal was in India last year when the World Health Organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country.

He previously was senior director for counterterrorism and deputy legal adviser at the National Security Council. The views expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion articles at CNN.

(CNN) Someday, Donald Trump will become ex-President Trump. After a guilty plea from his longtime ""fixer,"" Michael Cohen, alleging that Trump directed the commission of federal crimes, perhaps that day will arrive sooner rather than later. But whether it's a week, 18 months or more than six years away, we need to start preparing now. That's because, for all of the threat to our democracy Trump poses as president, he may pose an even bigger one as an ex-president.

No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he'll resign. Maybe he'll be impeached. Maybe he'll be voted out in November 2020 -- or maybe he'll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.

But, however he becomes an ex-president, it's impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon's post-presidency footsteps -- ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.

Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused , even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that's careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there's been one constant: a thirst for more attention.

So imagine ex-President Trump tweeting out real-time commentary on every move his successor makes. Imagine him continuing to fire up crowds at the campaign-style rallies he hasn't stopped doing even as a sitting president. Imagine him starting his own news media empire -- just as he apparently planned to do if he lost in 2016. He will be loud.

And he will be dangerous. Already, Trump is casting doubt on the validity of the upcoming midterm elections, suggesting that Moscow is intervening to favor the Democrats and predicting violence if Democrats reverse Republican gains. Already, Trump is indulging the voices of white supremacism and paranoia, finding moral equivalence ""on both sides"" in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, and criticizing tech companies for removing the hate-filled conspiracy theories of Alex Jones and his Infowars. Already, Trump is baselessly attacking other presidents, accusing Barack Obama of surveilling him and planting a spy in his campaign.

Now imagine what Trump will be without White House advisers surrounding him and at least trying to rein him in. Imagine how he might cast doubt on election results, especially ones that have landed him out of office. Imagine how he might seek to rally support wherever he can find it, even among the most extreme voices in our society. Imagine what he might accuse a successor of doing -- especially one who's just beaten him -- given what Trump has said about a predecessor against whom he didn't even run and who went out of his way to be cordial in the transition between them.

And think about Trump's supporters. For many who felt that they didn't have a voice in Washington, Trump was, at last, that voice. They won't want that voice to go silent. That's particularly true if they feel that, just as Trump told them , the system proves ""rigged."" They'll surely feel that way if Trump's impeached or effectively forced to resign. But, even if he's voted out -- or even if he serves for eight years but claims to have been hamstrung for much of it by a purported ""witch hunt"" led by special counsel Robert Mueller -- Trump's supporters will feel that they and he never really got a fair shake. And, as he always does, Trump will indulge that view -- indeed, he'll stoke it.

Our nation's thought leaders need to develop and agree to principles now to mitigate the looming threat posed by ex-President Trump. One might apply to the next president, whether Democratic or Republican: Simply do not engage with ex-President Trump, no matter how vicious his attacks become; isolate him by ignoring him.

Another might govern both sides of the aisle in Congress: Speak up loudly for the norm of ex-presidents treating their successors -- and the office itself -- with respect, even if they disagree with particular policies. And a third might guide the media: Make a pact (whether or not the likes of Breitbart and Fox News agree to it) not to give ex-President Trump more than perfunctory coverage, whatever invective he hurls and however the public remains fascinated by his norm-shattering behavior.

From the White House to the Capitol to the media, the dangers posed by ex-President Trump put a premium on electing leaders and supporting commentators who can make a compelling -- even passionate -- case for why fundamental norms of American governance and political dialogue need to be restored and protected.

There will, of course, be more to Trump's post-presidency than the man himself: He has introduced ideas that will not simply vanish when he leaves the White House. Some of those ideas concern how presidents (and even presidential candidates) communicate, such as by interrupting and talking over debate opponents as well as by using language -- like Trump's reference to ""s**thole countries"" -- previously unacceptable in mainstream politics or even society.

Some of those ideas relate to particular policies, from Trump's brand of economic nationalism to his insistence that immigration is predominantly a liability for the United States, its security and its identity. No matter how Trump leaves office, those ideas have now been normalized in ways that defy instant reversal. They will need to be addressed by deliberate norm-restoring behavior by future presidents and by the articulation of superior policies by politicians able to make those policies resonate with the public.

819,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/opinions/bernie-sanders-black-voters-opinion-martin/index.html,"Areva Martin is a CNN legal analyst, a civil rights attorney and St. Louis native. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Many of us vividly recall the hotly contested 2016 primary race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, whom I strongly supported. Sanders' message of fighting income inequality and pushing for Medicare for all resonated with many Democratic voters, as it does now, and after winning the New Hampshire primary he seemed to have momentum on his side. But the race inevitably shifted to the South and its heavy contingent of black voters.

Clinton benefited from her husband's popularity with black voters and pulverized Sanders in South Carolina by 47 percentage points. Sanders next got crushed on Super Tuesday, losing the southern and southwest states of Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Texas.

In 2020, Sanders was determined to avoid repeating that history.

He tried to increase his percentage of the black vote by blanketing Facebook with ads that highlighted his long-standing commitment to civil rights. He also talked up issues of paramount importance to the black community -- criminal justice reform and social-economic injustice. Sanders enlisted the help of influential black surrogates such as Harvard Professor Cornel West and rapper Killer Mike . He began airing a TV ad that features former President Barack Obama's past praise of him, even though he has positioned himself as the anti-establishment candidate. Former Obama aides like David Axelrod questioned the ad given that Sanders and the former President were not particularly close. In Mississippi , his campaign funded an ad campaign on black radio.

But despite all this, Sanders once again failed miserably with black voters. He got crushed, again, in South Carolina and then suffered a blowout loss on Super Tuesday.

And Tuesday night, he suffered perhaps a fatal blow by losing the three Ms -- Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan.

So, what did Sanders do wrong this time? Well, it didn't help that on the Sunday before Super Tuesday he failed to appear at a Bloody Sunday ceremonial event in Selma , Alabama, that honors the civil rights leaders who marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

Sanders compounded that mistake by canceling a rally in Mississippi . Perhaps unknown to him is that many African Americans from my hometown of St. Louis hail from the South and have deep ties to blacks in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. Sanders' actions were an affront not just to those southerners, but to blacks in Missouri.

Another crucial mistake by the presidential hopeful was his failure to control the vitriol coming from his ""Bernie Bro"" supporters. One example: After Joe Biden trounced Sanders in South Carolina by garnering 61% of the black vote, one Sanders supporter explained Biden's victory on Twitter, saying, ""People won't say it but the truth is that many voters in SC are low information voters. Which is a nice way to put it.""

Since South Carolina's Democratic electorate is more than 60% African American, the perception is that the Sanders supporter was equating ""low information voters"" to black voters who support Biden.

In fact, exit polling shows that white voters favored Biden to Sanders by a margin of 33% to 23% and that those with advanced degrees preferred Biden over Sanders 51% to 15%.

Sanders' relentless attacks on millionaires and billionaires didn't resonate with a large segment of the black community that takes pride in the successes of black billionaires such as Robert Smith , who paid off the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class at Morehouse College. Sanders doesn't seem to understand that although many African Americans suffer from an economic system stacked against them, we are economically aspirational.

Many African Americans applaud the high achievement and success of billionaires like Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z and Michael Jordan.

But Sanders' biggest mistake, undoubtedly, was his failure to understand the mindset of middle-aged and older African Americans.

For many of these voters, Trump's relentless attempts to dismantle Obamacare and destroy the entire legacy of the first black president -- Barack Obama -- has been an unending nightmare. The unyielding assault and systematic attack on other prominent African American leaders, like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and the dismantling of safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for seniors made removing Trump from office a pivotal issue for many black voters.

Joe Biden is not the perfect candidate. I take issue with many of the votes he cast as a senator and I wish his candidacy resonated more with younger voters. But Biden understands the importance of black voters and he has his pulse on the electorate. He had a regular presence in African American churches and gained the support of 100 black faith leaders in South Carolina leading up to the state's primary.

Many African Americans feel his concern for the problems plaguing our community is genuine, which is why he has scored overwhelming victories over Sanders in every state with a sizable number of black voters.

(CNN) Alcohol has many uses in a time of pandemic. One of them even comes recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 60% or higher alcohol by volume hand sanitizer (70% for cleaning surfaces) can help. Under the threat of coronavirus, just about any form of hand sanitizer or hand wipes are in short supply. Price gouging has begun in some quarters.

493,https://us.cnn.com/travel/article/uruguay-winery-bodega-garzn/index.html,"GarzÃÂ³n, Uruguay (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Terraced vines and spindly olive trees form a patchwork quilt over gently rolling hills, which are themselves covered by a maze of powdery dirt roads. Follow one of these bumpy paths far enough and you'll find an olive oil mill, a farm-to-table restaurant and a hilltop winery.

In fact, if you squint a bit, this place could pass for the famed Italian wine region of Tuscany -- that is, if you can overlook the wild capybaras (the world's largest rodents) and ostrich-like rheas running through the vines. These creatures, of course, are telltale signs you're in a totally different hemisphere on a completely different continent: South America.

It's not that South American wines aren't well known. When experts in California, France or Italy discuss fine wines from South America they typically reference two countries: Chile and Argentina.

Chile revived the lost French grape of CarmÃÂ©nÃÂ¨re and with it, fashioned Bordeaux blends that now rival those from the Old World. Meanwhile, Argentina spearheaded a global craze for Malbec that gave the varietal a permanent home on wine shelves the planet over.

Yet, there's another player that's slowly built up momentum in recent years, thanks, in no small part, to a pioneering new winery that's experimenting with grape varietals and dismantling regional stereotypes.

The country is Uruguay, and the winery is Bodega GarzÃÂ³n

This really is wine country

GarzÃÂ³n lies inland from the fashionable beach town of JosÃÂ© Ignacio, about three hours east of the capital Montevideo. The vines here are barely a decade old, but that hasn't stopped GarzÃÂ³n from racking up an impressive list of accolades.

Suddenly, the world is beginning to give South America's neglected stepchild a closer look.

Uruguay has a 150-year-long history of winemaking, but it's always struggled to get the kind of attention that its neighbors have received for decades.

Size may play a part. South America's second-smallest nation has historically had a wine industry that's slight in scale, miniscule in exports and iffy on quality.

Bodega GarzÃÂ³n is out to change that -- but it hasn't always been easy.

It's on South America's Atlantic Coast

GarzÃÂ³n's wines are influenced by the cool breezes of the nearby Atlantic Ocean. Courtesy Bogeda Garzon

Christian Wylie, the winery's managing director, says one of the biggest hurdles is its location: Many consumers don't even know where Uruguay is. (Hint: it's between Argentina and Brazil on South America's Atlantic Coast.)

""When we have tastings of GarzÃÂ³n wine around the world, one of the first things we do is show them a map,"" he says. ""We explain that Uruguay is at the same latitude as wine regions in Chile, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.""

In other words, the conditions are there to make great wine.

What makes Bodega GarzÃÂ³n so different from nearly every other winery in its own country is that it's located just 11 miles (18 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean.

Not only that, it's in an area that was, historically, little more than pasture for cows. (Uruguayans eat more beef, per capita, than any other country on Earth. Take that Argentina.)

Owner Alejandro Bulgheroni, a billionaire businessman from Argentina, planned to use this land for a wind farm thanks to its cool Atlantic breezes. His wife, Bettina, was concerned about the aesthetics (they have a house nearby) and convinced him to try grapes instead.

Local ocean-influenced wines

That's why Bulgheroni hired the renowned Italian oenologist Alberto Antonini to survey the rolling granitic hills and assess if they might be suitable for vines.

Just over a decade later, the pair has almost single-handedly created a 524-acre wine region while inspiring a local movement in ocean-influenced wines.

Uruguay has about 22,250 acres (about 9,000 hectares) under vine.

Most vineyards face the River Plate in Canelones Department, ""but I don't believe that's the best location,"" says Antonini. ""It's just the closest to Montevideo, where the first European immigrants arrived.""

In GarzÃÂ³n, Antonini and Bulgheroni believe they've stumbled across a new frontier for South American wines.

And Bulgheroni still figured out a way to use wind power.

Making wine the green way

Although his renewable energy project here might never have materialized, he's helped turn this place into the first winery in the world to achieve LEED silver certification for its entire facility, in part, thanks to the way it harnesses wind power. (Developed by the non-profit US Green Building Council, LEED assesses the potential environmental impacts and human benefits of a project.)

The winery's sustainable design includes headline-making features such as the largest green roof with native species in Latin America. The structure, conceived by Mendoza-based architecture firm BÃÂ³rmida & YanzÃÂ³n, was also built into hills and over natural terraces to utilize a gravity flow system for the production of its wines.

Though the winery itself didn't open until 2016, it now lures 20,000 visitors a year to the tiny town of Pueblo GarzÃÂ³n (population 200).

Most come for tours that dip underground into caves filled with barrels, steel tanks and concrete ""eggs"" (the ovular cement tanks that are suddenly all the rage with winemakers). You can also skirt past the abstract sculptural pieces of Uruguayan artist Pablo Atchugarry to tour the production line, which is capable of turning out 200,000 cases annually (though current production is around 110,000 cases).

A posh private club, commercial olive oil mill and 120-seat restaurant led by celebrity chef Francis Mallmann (whose primal technique of open-fire cooking featured on the Netflix series ""Chef's Table"") keep visitors lingering far longer than they might expect.

Part of Bodega GarzÃÂ³n's success in producing fine wine has been selecting varietals that will grow well in Uruguay's hot and humid climate.

Tannat, a highly tannic red wine varietal from the south of France, was already Uruguay's signature grape long before GarzÃÂ³n arrived on the scene. It was a given.

However, the Galician white wine varietal of AlbariÃÂ±o has proved to be one of GarzÃÂ³n's biggest surprises, winning awards for its freshness, minerality and round finish. The winery also gives the Bordeaux blending grape Cabernet Franc a starring turn as a single varietal, highlighting its soft tannins and peppery punch.

The icon wine, Balasto, is a blend of Tannat, Cabernet Frac, Merlot and Marselan. Its name is an homage to the weathered granite found in the soil at GarzÃÂ³n, which allows for drainage during the area's wetter months and keeps the wines here lively, rather than heavy.

Balasto spends 20 months in untoasted French oak barrels and retails for around $100 in the US, reaching a price point few Uruguayan wines could demand a decade ago.

485,https://cnn.com/travel/article/non-alcoholic-cocktails-boom/index.html,"London (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Up until relatively recently, non-alcoholic cocktails seemed like merely an afterthought for most bars.

As a result, teetotalers were often left with little choice but to guzzle juice, soda or water all night.

Those booze-free cocktails that did feature on drinks menus tended to be made up of popular cocktails minus the alcohol, which often left those buying them feeling shortchanged.

But the demand for non-alcoholic drinks has risen rapidly since then, as has the amount of high quality low and zero proof alcohol products available.

Now it seems mixologists are finally devoting as much time and effort into creating booze-free cocktails as alcoholic ones.

The spirit is usually replaced with something like Seedlip, a non-alcoholic botanical spirit, or Everleaf, an alcohol-free aperitif drink, although some bars have gone as far as to make their own hydrosols, or ""flower waters,"" using a rotovap, a device used for distilling.

Hamish Smith, Bars Editor of Drinks International , a revered global drinks journal, says this is a much welcome change.

""[It's] not an apologetic few lines at the back,"" says Smith. ""We're talking crafted cocktails that just so happen to not contain alcohol.""

Burgeoning market

Will Meredith, head bartender at Lyaness, says non-alcoholic cocktails are better than ever nowadays. CNN

The success of Dry January, which encourages participants to forgo alcohol for the first month of the year, has also had an impact -- 21% of US drinkers took part last year according to market research firm Nielsen.

Unsurprisingly, non-alcoholic cocktail sales are usually at their highest during this time, which means bars are having to up their game to ensure they can attract and cater for every type of customer.

""I definitely think we're moving away from a world where syrup topped up with a soft drink constitutes a non-alcoholic cocktail,"" says Will Meredith, head bartender for Lyaness, a popular London cocktail bar.

At Lyaness, the reincarnation of World's Best Bar 2018 winner Dandelyan, the commitment to non-alcoholic cocktails is clear.

When dreaming up their drinks menu, the team went to great pains to ensure there was a booze-free version of as many cocktails as possible.

""Non-alcoholic drinks are massively important to us. It's something we've always put a lot of love and time into,"" adds Meredith.

""Consumers who come into this bar, come for the whole experience. The experience isn't [and shouldn't be] dependent on what they're consuming.""

While the numbers vary from country to country, alcohol consumption is declining globally on the whole.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a nearly 5% point decrease, from 47.6% to 43%, in the number of drinkers across the world since 2000.

Although there doesn't seem to be a definitive explanation for this -- health consciousness is thought to among the contributing factors -- it's clear there's been a shift in attitudes towards alcohol.

According to Meredith, the customers who opt for non-alcoholic cocktails at Lyaness range from bankers to new mothers, while some choose to switch between booze-free cocktails and alcoholic ones.

""Non-alcoholic serves aren't anything new, but what is new is that they are taken seriously -- by bartenders and their customers,"" says Smith.

""Millennials and (drinking age) Generation Zs are drinking less, but don't want to be left out -- they want to experience cocktail bars in the same way drinkers do.

""The bar world has reacted -- it has to. After all, bartenders' raw material is liquid -- it doesn't always have to be alcoholic.""

The cocktails at Lyaness consist of seven core ingredients -- infinite banana, purple pineapple, king monkey nut, ONYX, aromatized milk wine, old fashioned whiskey and ultra raspberry.

Related content This bar got famous not serving alcohol

Meredith says the mixologists always have a non-alcoholic version in mind when choosing a base spirit to compliment the main ingredient, and will keep looking for a suitable booze-free option until they've exhausted all avenues.

He makes a point of referring to the drinks as non-alcoholic cocktails rather than ""mocktails,"" as they're often called, explaining the label has negative connotations.

""The word 'mock' in itself means a bit of a lighthearted joke,"" Meredith points out.

Of the 20-plus cocktails on the menu here, there are seven non-alcoholic versions.

Among the most popular is Tattie Milk Punch, made up of vegan honey, ""potato cream"" and Aecorn (a non-alcoholic aperitif) and Seedlip Spice.

Pina Leaf High Ball, consisting of purple pineapple, gooseberry, salted pineapple leaf, soda and Seedlip Grove is also a favorite.

Costly experience?

The non-alcoholic version of the Pina Leaf High Ball is one of the most popular boozeless cocktails. CNN

One of the most surprising elements about the rise in non-alcoholic cocktails is the amount customers are prepared to pay for them -- although some may argue waking up without a hangover after a night out drinking is utterly priceless.

A standard cocktail at Lyaness, costs between ÃÂ£10 to ÃÂ£15 ($13 to $19) while a non-alcoholic cocktail is priced at around ÃÂ£7 (around $10).

Although the booze-free versions are significantly cheaper, $10 still feels like a sizable amount for a non-alcoholic drink.

So why are customers seemingly happy to splash the cash?

""I think the driving force has been this transition away from putting the value of a drink on the alcoholic content,"" says Meredith, stressing that bartenders have to put a lot of effort into crafting great tasting non-alcoholic cocktails ""without the luxury of booze.""

He also emphasizes Lyaness' non-alcoholic cocktails are made with high end products such as vegan honey and homemade cordials, which are factors in the total cost.

""Non-alcoholic cocktails are becoming so much more in depth, intricate and balanced than they've ever been,"" he adds.

""So the people who weren't drinking [before] now finally see something of value they can consume, and they're willing to pay the money that's required to enjoy it.""

The ever-growing number of non-alcohol products entering the drinks market has allowed bars like Lyaness to be even more creative with its non-alcoholic additions.

These include Stryyk, a non-alcoholic rum made of cane sugar, vanilla and oak and CaleÃÂ±o, a distilled spirit with botanicals, as well as Seedlip and Everclear.

And with more and more similar products launching every year, as well as the emergence of new alcohol-free bars such as New York's Getaway bar and Redemption Bar in London, it's likely demand will continue to grow.

""There are a lot of people who are doing amazing things in the non-alcoholic industry at the moment,"" says Meredith.

""As long as we put our foot on the gas and don't let up, it's only going to get better.""

In fact, the non-alcoholic beverage market is expected to reach a record value of $1,650.28 billion globally by 2024, according to a report by Zion Market Research

""This isn't a trend,"" says Smith. ""It's how things will be from now on in.""",How non-alcoholic cocktails are shaking up the bar scene,"Now it seems mixologists are finally devoting as much time and effort into creating booze-free cocktails as alcoholic ones.

(CNN) ""We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus ... I will always put the well-being of America first."" After weeks of downplaying the outbreak, US President Donald Trump addressed the nation last night, announcing a suspension of travel from Europe and emergency action to help Americans affected by the virus.

Yet the speech -- in which he described the disease as a ""foreign virus"" and blamed Europe for its spread to the US -- brought more confusion to an already rattled nation. Trump's administration was later forced to clarify that the ban would apply to ""people, not goods,"" and only to foreign nationals, not Americans who had been screened before entering the country.

But as infections in the US soar past 1,200 , communal spread appears to be more of a threat than foreign transmission. States are demanding more test kits amid a continued shortage, begging the question of whether the number of reported cases reflects the reality of the crisis.

Trump spoke to the nation at a fearful moment, Stephen Collinson writes . Schools across the country are closing, the NBA basketball league has been suspended, and hospitals are on high alert.

Around the same time Trump was speaking, actor Tom Hanks , known affectionately as ""America's dad,"" announced in an Instagram post from Australia that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the disease.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Airlines and passengers scrambling

""If the leader of the free world is telling you that, you know, your travel is being affected, I would think that we have to give you your money back."" That was the advice of an airline worker at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to passengers waiting to board a flight to Dublin moments after Trump announced his new travel ban. Airlines are scrambling to understand and implement the restrictions, as travelers race back to the US before the deadline or weigh canceling trips, Madeline Holcombe writes

The 30-day ban, which starts at 11:59 p.m. Friday, applies to 26 European countries; it doesn't apply to the UK, despite a spike in cases there. Americans and US permanent residents will still be allowed to fly to Europe and return to the US, but will be screened upon re-entry and face quarantine or restrictions on movement for 14 days. It's not clear whether airlines will still fly the routes if passenger demand from European nationals dries up.

In a strongly-worded statement, the European Union said it disapproved of the ban, which was imposed ""without consultation.""

The UK said today that it would not introduce US-style travel bans, but others are. The Czech Republic will enforce controls on its borders with Germany and Austria; India has suspended all visas until April, effectively barring all foreigners from visiting; and Australia has extended its travel ban for Italy, Iran, China and South Korea.

NBA suspends season

""What we really need to cancel is 2020!"" said Los Angeles Lakers star Lebron James after the NBA suspended its entire season . In Oklahoma City, fans were getting ready for the start of a game between the Thunder and the Utah Jazz last night when players abruptly walked off the court -- one had tested positive for the disease. The decision by one of the world's most profitable sports leagues comes amid growing cancelations and adjustments across the globe.

The latest: the World Figure Skating Championships has been canceled, NCAA Division I Men's and Women's basketball tournaments will proceed but without spectators, and Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers are working on ""alternative plans"" for their regular season opener. But officials organizing the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo still say that canceling the games is ""unthinkable.""
