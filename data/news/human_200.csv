(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.

Boston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.

Until I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.

I'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.

The pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)

The pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.

As Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.

""Even before the dawn of social media,"" they write, ""adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist.""

So true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, naÃÂ¯ve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.

But while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to ""go viral"") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?

Now that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?

I could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a ""socially-adept"" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.

Looking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.

I'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.

I think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.

There's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.

When we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).

Of course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to ""just ignore them"" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.

As difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.

Being 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.",I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.

556,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-school-closing-lunches-kids-eat/index.html,"(CNN) A school district in New York has canceled classes and activities until next week because a faculty member contracted the novel coronavirus.

Seattle Public Schools, near the epicenter of an outbreak in Washington, says a staff member tested positive for the virus this week, triggering closures for a minimum of 14 days.

And another district nearby has closed for up to two weeks and transitioned to ""online learning"" because a parent in the district has also contracted the disease.

But as other schools deliberate shutting their doors to slow the spread of the coronavirus, some parents may be left to wonder: If schools close, how will my child eat?

Across the United States, millions of students rely on school lunches, more than 20 million of which are distributed for free each day, according to the US Department of Agriculture

If classes are canceled, figuring out how to provide those meals to students is a challenge, with a web of federal rules governing when and where students can receive food.

While regulators have eased some of those restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, school closures remain ""an evolving situation with many unknowns and complex considerations that vary from one community to the next,"" said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association.

Federal waivers relax rules for coronavirus closures

When schools close unexpectedly -- during a pandemic , for example -- the USDA allows them to provide food to students using programs designed for summer meals, which are often offered at churches, parks and other community sites.

Schools can then be reimbursed by the federal government for the meals they provide, just as they would be during the summer, according to a USDA memorandum issued last year.

The catch, according to the School Nutrition Association, is that the meal distribution sites, including unused schools, must be located in areas where at least half of children come from low-income families.

Using those sites is a ""first step that gives schools in many low income communities the option to continue some form of meal service during coronavirus school closures,"" but the reality is that ""needy students live in all communities,"" said Pratt-Heavner, whose group represents school nutrition professionals.

Underscoring the complex bureaucracy that governs school lunches, meals distributed during unexpected closures also typically have to be eaten in "" congregate feeding "" sites intended to encourage community bonding.

But federal health officials have warned that students should avoid eating in large groups during the coronavirus outbreak, and the USDA issued waivers this past weekend to allow to-go meals in two states hardest hit by the coronavirus epidemic, California and Washington.

Sack lunches and grab-and-go foods

In Washington, a state that has seen more than 200 coronavirus cases, the Northshore School District has moved classes online because a parent tested positive for the coronavirus.

The district, which said it would not have in-person classes for up to two weeks, is offering meals for pick up at 22 school sites. Five production sites are making grab-and-go meals, according to Juliana Fisher, the district's director of food and nutrition services.

And while school closures are always a last resort, some of the nation's largest districts are also making plans to feed students if the coronavirus forces them to shut down.

Not far from the early epicenter of the US outbreak, for example, Seattle Public Schools prepared ""to provide sack lunches prepared by staff in our central kitchen,"" according to Tim Robinson, a spokesperson for the district.

The NYC Department of Education, which serves more than a million students, said that ""if a school is closed for 24 hours, we're prepared to serve grab-and-go breakfast and lunch for any student who wants it,"" according to spokesperson Miranda Barbot.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools, also one of the nation's largest school systems, said it would work with state and federal officials to ""ensure that students in any affected schools are provided with the meals they have come to depend on,"" according to spokesperson Jackie Calzadilla.

And Chicago Public Schools, which currently has one school closed, has ""established a special hotline and email for those families who need support with meals or have additional questions,"" said Emily Bolton, a district spokesperson.

Many schools are preparing to provide meals during potential coronavirus closures. But what those will look in practice -- especially if closures are widespread and prolonged -- remains to be seen.

In California, for example, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Unified School District, Shannon Haber, said that schools are operating normally. But ""we are planning for everything,"" she said. ""Meals to students included.""

Asked how meals would be distributed and what parents can expect, though, her response was brief: ""I have no further information at this time.""",The coronavirus pandemic is closing schools.

A 19-year-old pregnant woman from Guatemala died from injuries suffered after falling from the US-Mexico border wall, US and Guatemalan officials say.

Miriam Stephany GirÃÂ³n Luna fell as she tried to climb the steel mesh barrier near El Paso, Texas on Saturday.

She was taken to hospital where doctors tried to deliver the baby by emergency C-section without success.

Officials say the case indicates a change in how migrants are trying to reach the US amid new restrictions.

President Donald Trump has made the fight against illegal migration to the US a major policy issue and has taken measures to deter entry across the border from Mexico, including plans for a border wall. Large sections of the border near El Paso already have some form of barrier.

GirÃÂ³n Luna was travelling with a 26-year-old man believed to be her partner and the baby's father, and fell more than 6m (19ft), Guatemala's foreign ministry said on Thursday (in Spanish). The man eventually found US border patrol agents, who called for an ambulance to rescue her.

According to the statement, GirÃÂ³n Luna was taken to a hospital in El Paso with a cerebral haemorrhage, liver and kidney lacerations and a pelvis fracture. She underwent multiple surgeries but died from her injuries on Tuesday.

The Guatemalan statement said she was seven months pregnant while US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said she was eight months.

Gloria Chavez, CBP's El Paso sector chief, blamed the death on ""human smugglers"" who had ""encouraged her and helped her climb"" the barrier. ""We will engage our law enforcement partners in Mexico to find those responsible for placing these lives in danger,"" she said in a statement.

Media reports said GirÃÂ³n Luna was a social worker and beauty pageant winner and wanted to reach the US to help her family financially.

Tens of thousands of people from Guatemala and neighbouring El Salvador and Honduras have tried to enter the US in recent years with many saying they are facing violence and poverty.

The number of Guatemalans trying to climb the US-Mexico border wall rose recently because they no longer surrender to US border patrol, Tekandi Paniagua Flores, the Guatemalan consul in Del Rio, Texas, told the Associated Press news agency.

That is because changes implemented by the US government, including the Remain in Mexico policy that forces asylum seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico until a decision on their cases is reached, have made it more difficult for many people to remain in the US once they are caught.

The man who was travelling with GirÃÂ³n Luna is under US custody. Guatemala's foreign ministry said it had started the process to repatriate GirÃÂ³n Luna's body.

Ã¢ÂÂDo you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Horvath asks her editorÃ¢ÂÂs widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)

The show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. Ã¢ÂÂWhy arenÃ¢ÂÂt you mourning quietly?Ã¢ÂÂ asks Adam, HannahÃ¢ÂÂs boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editorÃ¢ÂÂs obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called Ã¢ÂÂAnd Now TheyÃ¢ÂÂre Dead.Ã¢ÂÂ Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer LÃ¢ÂÂWren ScottÃ¢ÂÂs suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.

Ms. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, Ã¢ÂÂHow can I really help?Ã¢ÂÂ It would be great if everyone said, Ã¢ÂÂCan I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ

Last February, on what would have been Ms. RosenthalÃ¢ÂÂs 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friendÃ¢ÂÂs Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. Ã¢ÂÂA lot of what she wrote wasnÃ¢ÂÂt true,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Feldman said. Ã¢ÂÂBeccaÃ¢ÂÂs mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. FeldmanÃ¢ÂÂs explanation for that kind of behavior is Ã¢ÂÂperformative grief,Ã¢ÂÂ she said, adding: Ã¢ÂÂThatÃ¢ÂÂs the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, Ã¢ÂÂlook at meÃ¢ÂÂ behavior.Ã¢ÂÂ On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.

Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, Ã¢ÂÂ said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.

Then thereÃ¢ÂÂs the lingua franca of social media Ã¢ÂÂ the like button Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs totally discordant with death. Ã¢ÂÂMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing Ã¢ÂÂ136 people like thisÃ¢ÂÂ underneath?Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a Ã¢ÂÂsympathize button,Ã¢ÂÂ something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company.

(CNN) As America approaches the end of Donald Trump's first year as President , one point on which the entire country can agree is that this has been a year like no other in the nation's history. If the polls are to be believed, most of us see Trump's presidency so far as a slow-motion calamity.

And yet, not every development in the last year has been negative. The Trump presidency has energized the country and given it a new mood of seriousness.

It has reminded America about its priorities and caused its people to ponder important questions. Even if he has done so unwittingly, we can thank President Trump for bringing some exciting changes to the country. Here are five of Donald Trump's greatest unintentional accomplishments.

Sparking the women's movement and a conversation about decency

It all started before he came into office, when voters heard and saw how he talked to and about women. We heard the women who accused him of sexual harassment; we saw how he disparaged women on the campaign trail ; and we saw that he became President in spite of it all.

On the day after the inauguration, millions of women took to the streets around the world to make it clear that women would not sit back and watch Trump's style become the new normal. The women's march became likely the largest single day demonstration in US history.

And that was just the beginning. As the backlash against sexism has continued, courageous women revealed the extent of abuse they have experienced in all facets of life. The #MeToo movement took down some of the most prominent figures in journalism, entertainment, politics and elsewhere. And the tsunami against abuse is still raging.

It's no wonder ""feminism"" is Merriam-Webster's word of the year, its most searched term.

And the best is still to come.

The next elections should bring a tide of women to public office. EMILY's List, the group that helps women political candidates, reportedly says last year it had heard from about 1,000 women interested in getting its support. This year, the number skyrocketed to 22,000

Killing apathy

Trump's presidency has electrified the country, creating a sense of energy and urgency unlike anything the United States had seen in at least a generation. Today, even people who routinely muttered, ""I hate politics,"" and stayed uninvolved, are bristling with political thoughts and following the latest news about Trump's legislative agenda, the Russia investigation, and matters as obscure as the gap between what Trump says and what his secretary of state argues.

Americans have discovered that political apathy is a luxury better left to people living in countries where they trust their government.

Raising the question: What really makes America great?

As soon as he took office, Trump started trying to enact the agenda that he claimed would Make America Great Again. But to millions of Americans, Trump's agenda and rhetoric seemed to highlight precisely the opposite.

Trump forced many who had not given the matter much thought to consider what exactly it is that makes America great: its pursuit of ideals such as respect for the individual, for a free press, for equality; and the sacred notion of ""rule of law,"" that no individual, however powerful, stands above the law or should wield his power to interfere with justice.

Trump helped us understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism is love for one's country. It compels us to protect those characteristics that make it worth loving, and to strive to bring the country closer to its ideals. Nationalism, on the other hand, is what Trump preaches in his MAGA creed. It is an attitude of superiority, tainted with notions of ethnic and religious supremacy.

Reinvigorating journalism

When historians look back at the Trump era, they will note that Trump spawned a golden age of journalism. Even as Trump declared war on the media, casting doubt on any piece of news he found unflattering by calling it ""fake news,"" serious journalists went to work with more determination than ever.

Sure, journalists made mistakes, and when discovered, they were promptly corrected. That stands in sharp contrast to Trump's avalanche of lies. By The New York Times' count, Trump has told nearly six times as many falsehoods in 10 months than Barack Obama told in eight years as President. Trump succeeded in confusing the public and blurring reality. It was all in keeping with his gaslighting technique . But the reality-based media fought back with facts and with in-depth reporting that brought Americans history-changing truths.

Giving satire a shot in the arm

While Trump made Americans more serious, he also made comedians much funnier. Political humor blossomed like never before. Observers noted that the President himself hardly ever laughs unless in the company of adoring crowds, with his sense of humor limited to mocks and insults.

But for professional humorists, Trump was a godsend. The bittersweet cracks propelled the ruthlessly brilliant Stephen Colbert to new levels of hilarity, and the more Trump-centered his jokes became, the higher his ratings climbed.

So, you see, it hasn't all been bad. Perhaps Vladimir Putin is right when he says Trump has made significant achievements. Although, this is probably not what Putin or what Trump has in mind when he falsely claims he has accomplished more than any of his predecessors.

It's more along the lines of Colbert's comment after Roy Moore lost the election in Alabama, when he said , ""I'm a little shaky ... due to a condition my doctor calls 'hope.'""

These are at least five achievements from the Trump administration that can give Americans that same hope.","In 2017, Trump revived feminism, saved satire and reinvigorated journalism","The Trump presidency has energized the country and given it a new mood of seriousness.

728,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump issued a federal emergency declaration Friday afternoon over the coronavirus outbreak following a week of cancellations, suspensions and growing case numbers that unsettled Americans nationwide.

An emergency or disaster declaration from the President frees up additional money and sets the Federal Emergency Management Agency in motion.

There are two types of declarations authorized by the Stafford Act, which is the statutory authority for "" most federal disaster response activities "": emergency declarations and major disaster declarations.

The difference between the two -- both of which unlock additional resources, like supplies and logistical help -- is scope and money.

Here's what to know about Trump's declaration:

What does a declaration do?

A declaration puts FEMA, which is supporting the Health and Human Services Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for coronavirus response, in a position to be the coordinator.

""The center of gravity switches from HHS headquarters to FEMA,"" said Daniel Kaniewski, who previously served as deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA.

More federal funds will become available, as will supplies, personnel and any other support. FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor told lawmakers Wednesday that the agency's warehouses are stocked with commodities across the country.

When activated, FEMA can help with logistics, like the transport of residents if needed, and put up temporary medical facilities. Those resources could come from across federal agencies, from stocked warehouses and through contracts. States will likely communicate what they need and where they need it.

Steve Reaves, president of the union that represents FEMA workers, said that during the California wildfires, for example, FEMA came in, put up tents, set up command and control centers, and worked with state and local governments to track casualties.

But during other health crises -- including Zika, H1N1 and SARS -- FEMA maintained a supporting role to HHS and declarations were never issued, according to Michael Coen, a senior adviser for emergency management at IEM and former FEMA chief of staff during the Obama administration.

""None of those became as big of an outbreak as we're seeing with COVID-19. But those were examples of FEMA being in support of HHS in some way, but without the use of a Stafford emergency declaration or major disaster declaration,"" he said.

Washington asked for a declaration on Thursday

Requests are generally made by the governor of an affected state. States have been scrambling to sort out what they need to respond to the increasing number of coronavirus cases before they make that request. During the week, FEMA personnel fielded questions from state staff about what support the agency -- which is within the Department of Homeland Security -- can provide to respond to the outbreak, said Reaves.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday requested that the administration declare a national emergency.

""It is incumbent on all of us to acknowledge the gravity of this public health emergency and take the necessary actions now Ã¢ÂÂ not tomorrow, not next week Ã¢ÂÂ to slow the spread of the virus and save lives,"" Inslee said in a statement Friday. ""By declaring a national emergency, the federal government can provide states with direct assistance to meet our residents' needs for health care, shelter, food and cash assistance, and more.""

Additional declarations might come later

Additional declarations might also be issued down the line, so the federal government can reimburse state and local governments for the costs incurred during an incident. For example, President Bill Clinton issued an emergency declaration in 2000 over the West Nile virus, authorizing millions of dollars in federal funds to reimburse affected local governments.

Declarations can start as one type of emergency and then change to another in order to access more resources. These declarations are separate from the national emergency Trump declared over the southern US border last year.

Why did it take so long to declare?

Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, in conjunction with Sens. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, and Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, sent a letter asking Trump to ""immediately"" consider disaster declaration requests for the coronavirus.

The reason for the delay in proceeding with a request may have been because states were still assessing their resources and the federal assistance received thus far.

""It's possible that a) the states have the resources it needs b) that the state has most of the resources it needs and the resources it doesn't have it's getting from HHS and the $8.3 billion,"" Kaniewski, who's now a managing director at Marsh & McLennan Companies.

""I think in the future if those -- and that future can be today or a week from now or it could be never -- if they require supplemental assistance beyond what they're getting from HHS, there would be an obvious time to submit an emergency declaration request.""

New Jersey told CNN on Thursday, for example, that it hadn't reached that point. ""Due to the recent release of more than $15 (million) in HHS funding that can be used for these COVID-19 costs, the State thresholds for FEMA assistance certainly have not been met yet,"" according to a statement from the governor's office Thursday.

As the crisis evolves, states will likely continue to review their needs and the role of federal assistance.",Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"(CNN) President Donald Trump issued a federal emergency declaration Friday afternoon over the coronavirus outbreak following a week of cancellations, suspensions and growing case numbers that unsettled Americans nationwide.
An emergency or disaster declaration from the President frees up additional money and sets the Federal Emergency Management Agency in motion.

But those were examples of FEMA being in support of HHS in some way, but without the use of a Stafford emergency declaration or major disaster declaration,"" he said.

727,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/task-force-coronavirus-trump-praise/index.html,"After being asked whether she was concerned that there could be patients who don't get a ventilator -- or if ""actual physical equipment that is needed to serve the people who get sick is out there"" -- Verma told Fox News: ""And that's why the President has taken such bold and decisive action. We're not waiting for this to get worse. We're not waiting for this to be a crisis in our health care systems.""

She did not answer the question. As health officials on the President's coronavirus task force have faced tough questioning about the federal government's ability to confront the ballooning crisis, they have at times turned to praising Trump instead.

And even though flattering the boss comes with the territory in the Trump administration -- a qualification on display in his first Cabinet meeting -- it's an approach health officials are now taking in the face of a major national crisis.

One official who has received praise from both sides of the political aisle for his straightforward answers is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the President's coronavirus task force. He was one of few officials to acknowledge deficiencies in diagnostic testing and has repeatedly yet delicately corrected the President on the timeline of vaccine development.

In recent days, some lawmakers have urged the President to let Fauci be the public face of the administration's response to coronavirus. The President has praised Fauci and pointed out the doctor's place on the task force -- but some of the lawmakers hope Trump will go further and just let Fauci do the talking.

Non-administration health officials have raised concerns about persistent delays in testing that have caused an obfuscated view of how widespread the virus is in the US, and hospital administrators have advised that they do not have the supplies or room to treat the patients they're expecting.

But when Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accompanied the president to the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta last Friday, he was asked to address the press. He took the opportunity to lavish praise on the man standing next to him.

""First, I want to thank you for your decisive leadership in helping us, you know, put public health first,"" Redfield said. ""I also want to thank you for coming here today and -- and sort of encouraging and bringing energy to the men and women that you see that work every day to try to keep America safe. So, I think that's the most important thing I want to say, sir.""

Then in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, an anesthesiologist who is in his mid-40s, insisted the President was ""healthier than I am"" after being asked if Trump and other aging Democratic candidates should stop traveling given they are in a category most vulnerable to contracting coronavirus.

""Speaking of being at risk, the President, he sleeps less than I do and he's healthier than what I am,"" Adams claimed. He later walked back the remark.

In the days since Trump announced that anyone who wants a test can get a test, a bipartisan group of lawmakers have expressed frustration with the lack of availability. One Republican senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, said the President's claim was inaccurate.""

""People should stop saying if you want a test, you should get a test right now,"" Lankford said after a briefing with administration officials. ""That's not here at this point.""",Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"As health officials on the President's coronavirus task force have faced tough questioning about the federal government's ability to confront the ballooning crisis, they have at times turned to praising Trump instead.

Not even fears about the coronavirus could stop many people from taking to the streets in India to celebrate Holi , one of the world's most photogenic religious festivals, although some donned face masks.

Others, including India's prime minister, opted to give it a miss altogether.

Usually a huge draw for tourists, Holi is traditionally celebrated across India, South Asia and among the Indian diaspora as the spring equinox approaches in the northern hemisphere. This year, it's celebrated on March 9 and 10.

With participants ranging from the old to the young, irrespective of class, the Hindu festival generally is viewed as a bringing together of the community, with swathes of people collectively taking to the streets of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other regions of India to celebrate.

Good over evil

Bright powders and water balloons are launched in the air by participants of ""the Festival of Colors"" with the aim of smearing and throwing as much gulal -- a fine powder offered in several shades -- as possible on friends and family.

Celebrated for centuries, the festival symbolizes the triumph of good over evil and commemorates new beginnings.

Over time, however, Holi has found a place in popular culture. It's now celebrated globally each year and inspires events such as ""The Color Run"" race series, and clothing design, such as Pharrell Williams and Adidas' Hu Holi shoe collaboration.

554,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/health/us-coronavirus-updates-friday/index.html,"(CNN) For many Americans, the past 48 hours have felt like uncharted territory.

Despite the unprecedented measures, one top US health official said the number of outbreaks is ""definitely going to get worse before it gets better.""

There's no way around it, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CNN on Thursday night. ""We will have a lot more cases.""

At least 1,740 cases have been reported across 48 states and the District of Columbia. At least 41 people have died: 31 in Washington state, which has been the epicenter of the outbreak, with at least 457 cases; four in California; two in Florida; one in Georgia; one in Kansas; one in New Jersey and one in South Dakota.

Among the new patients reported Friday was Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who said he would go into self-quarantine after he was in the same room last weekend as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his entourage. Bolsonaro's press secretary tested positive Thursday for coronavirus.

""I feel completely healthy and strong,"" Suarez said in a statement. ""However, I am doing the responsible thing by working with the County's Health Department to take every precaution to ensure that not only my family is healthy, but everyone I have come in contact with is healthy as well.""

The number of cases across the country will likely continue jumping as more tests become available and some facilities begin conducting drive-through testing.

Gatherings are banned, schools are closed

Across many states, the bottom line: Stay home. And if you have to go out, keep your distance.

Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon became the first states to announce statewide shutdowns of all K-12 schools. Friday morning, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the San Diego Unified School District -- which together serve more than 750,000 students -- announced they would close for two weeks, beginning Monday.

""You got to try to slow this thing down early,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told CNN's John Berman on Friday.

Ohio had only five confirmed cases of the coronavirus. But ""two weeks is too late. Another week is too late,"" DeWine said he'd been told by experts.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued guidance to shut down all public and private K-12 schools in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties, the state's most populous areas, for the next six weeks.

""Today's decision has a full range of implications from learning plans and childcare, to free and reduced-price breakfast and lunch, just to name a few,"" Inslee said in a statement. ""I anticipate this will cause ripple effects ... but we can't afford not to do it.""

A day earlier, Inslee announced a ban on all events with more than 250 people in the state's largest three counties. He has also issued guidance for assisting-living facilities to limit visitors after at least 10 homes reported cases.

The announcement paralleled the one by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who directed events with 500 or more people to be canceled or postponed and announced only ""medically necessary visits"" will be allowed in nursing homes. Some experts have advised banning all visitors from skilled-nursing facilities nationwide

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he stood by Cuomo's announcement on large gatherings and called the city's rising coronavirus case numbers ""striking and troubling."" New York City had 42 new cases in a day, he said.

""We don't do any of this lightly. This is difficult,"" he said at a Thursday news conference. ""We know it has a serious, serious impact on a number of businesses ... that's really, really painful for the many, many people who work in that field.""

Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said he asked the governor to issue an executive order to postpone the state's April 4 presidential primary for two months, until June 20. He said coronavirus was ""an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced.""

Similar directives were issued by California, Oregon, New Mexico, Ohio and Utah leaders, who urged the cancellation of large public events.

In Georgia, which had its first death Thursday and has reported 42 cases, officials designated a state park with emergency mobile units as an isolation site for residents who test positive.

At least nine school districts -- including the state's three largest -- also announced closures as early as Friday and lasting up to two weeks.

Others hit the pause button

Augusta National Golf Club on Friday announced that the Masters will be postponed in response to the outbreak. The year's first major was scheduled to tee off on April 9.

It was one of many cancellations that left the public stunned.

In New York, which reported 328 positive cases, the Broadway League said it is suspending all shows through April 12 ""in support of the health and well-being of the theatre public, as well as those who work in the theatre industry.""

The NBA is suspending the rest of its season, it said Wednesday, after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the virus. That announcement came shortly after the NCAA announced it would ban public audiences from March Madness games -- then a day later canceled the tournaments altogether.

Some shoppers panic-buy essentials

Fearing what might come, Americans from New York to Chicago to Atlanta flocked grocery stores, emptying shelves of essentials.

One Massachusetts resident told CNN it took nearly half an hour to check out as staff members reassured shoppers via intercom that the store would stay open all weekend.

In New York City, some grocery stores had little to nothing left, a Twitter user posted.

Go to any NYC grocery store or Target, view the empty shelves and tell me again the overreaction is on Twitter only, lol. pic.twitter.com/22WQdb1Ev7 Ã¢ÂÂ BeauxAfrique (@BeauxAfrique) March 12, 2020

""Well, it's been very intense,"" Avi Kaner, co-owner of Morton Williams, a New York supermarket chain, told CNN.

The uptick in business began about 10 days ago, Kaner said. But on Thursday, there was a record-breaking 300% to 400% surge in business, he said.

Certain items, like hand sanitizer and wipes, are being rationed by some distributors, Kaner said, and they're gone within minutes of being stocked in store.

""Whenever we do get new rations in of hand sanitizer and wipes, we actually put them out by the registers, and they go within minutes,"" he said.

Shopping patterns mirrored those ""you would see as people prepare for a major storm,"" a Walmart spokesperson told CNN earlier this month

At one grocery chain in Pennsylvania, shelves were kept ""packed with products similar to when a blizzard is being called for and folks know they might be stuck at home ,"" a sales executive said.

'Shutting down most of our structures of society'

DeWine said he wants his state to ""treat this like it is -- and that is a crisis.""

The state has reported five positive cases, but Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton said it's likely that number is not even close to the real tally of infections.

""We know now, just the fact of community spread says that at least 1%... of our population is carrying the virus in Ohio today,"" Acton said Thursday in a news conference. ""We have 11.7 million people. So, the math is: over 100,000. That just gives you a sense of how this virus spreads and is spreading quickly.""

""The steps we are taking will absolutely save lives,"" she said of the governor's actions. ""We're all sort of waking up to this new reality.""

State officials will release fact sheets and checklists to help residents ""figure out what this new norm is going to be like,"" she said.

""We are basically slowly shutting down most of our structures of society,"" she said.

Drive-through testing begins

The number of US cases is likely to be much higher and will continue to climb as more Americans are tested, health officials have said.

But that process, initially conducted by the CDC, has proved faulty. The slow rollout prompted the federal government to approve private labs to conduct their own testing and has so far sent out more than a million tests. Vice President Mike Pence said 4 million more would be available by the end of the week.

The testing system currently in place is not geared to the country's needs, and ""that is a failing,"" Fauci, with the National Institutes of Health, told a congressional committee Thursday

""The idea of anybody getting it (a test) easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,"" Fauci said. ""Do I think we should be? Yes, but we're not.""

Communities in New York, Illinois and Colorado began moving toward drive-through testing.

Health care workers from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment test people for Covid-19 on Thursday in Denver at the state's first drive-up testing center.

Cuomo announced New York will have the first drive-through testing facility on the East Coast and officials will start testing people by appointment in New Rochelle, a suburb community that registered more than 100 cases in about a week and has imposed a 1-mile containment zone

""You have to make an appointment. You can't just show up,"" Cuomo told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Friday.

With the anxiety and fear surrounding the virus, the governor said, it's not feasible to test just anyone who wants to be assessed.

""We have to prioritize, because we don't have that kind of capacity,"" he said.

A suburban Illinois hospital said it also will try drive-through tests, telling residents they would drive up to an ambulance and get tested without leaving their car, CNN affiliate WGN reported.",America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down,"There's no way around it, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CNN on Thursday night.

1250,https://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20200311-the-plot-against-americas-vision-feels-eerily-familiar,"Perhaps because our own times seem bleak, alternate histories are flourishing on screen, ranging from the dystopian, piercingly real HandmaidÃ¢ÂÂs Tale to the apocalyptic, mind-bending Watchmen and most recently Hunters, with cartoonish characters pursuing resurgent Nazis. All reassure us Ã¢ÂÂAt least that didnÃ¢ÂÂt happenÃ¢ÂÂ. Like The HandmaidÃ¢ÂÂs Tale, based on Margaret AtwoodÃ¢ÂÂs novel, the HBO series The Plot Against America has an impeccable literary source. Philip RothÃ¢ÂÂs 2004 novel posits that aviator Charles Lindbergh, a national hero, Nazi sympathiser and isolationist Ã¢ÂÂ all of those things historically true Ã¢ÂÂ became US president in the early 1940s, with Hitler on the rise.

More like this:

- The TV show that predicted the future

- Al PacinoÃ¢ÂÂs Nazi-hunting show is a hit

- Is this the new Big Little Lies?

The story is explosive. An ordinary, working-class Jewish family in New Jersey Ã¢ÂÂ Herman and Bess Levin, their two young sons and their relatives Ã¢ÂÂ grapple with the fallout of an anti-Semite in the White House. The showÃ¢ÂÂs high-profile creators are David Simon and Ed Burns, the team behind the classic series The Wire. And the performances are stunning, especially Zoe KazanÃ¢ÂÂs as the fearful but realistic Bess and Winona RyderÃ¢ÂÂs as her self-deluding sister, Evelyn. So why is this uneven miniseries far less compelling than it sounds on paper?

It becomes more chilling the more it departs from reality, with terrible events that are not unimaginable

Part of the problem lies with history itself. What Roth imagined as outlandish in 2004 is all too familiar now. LindberghÃ¢ÂÂs real-life isolationist slogan Ã¢ÂÂAmerica FirstÃ¢ÂÂ has been appropriated by Donald Trump. In the years since the novelÃ¢ÂÂs publication, ethnic hatred and white supremacism have been resurgent around the world. In many ways, RothÃ¢ÂÂs history doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem alternate at all.

That problem is compounded by the showÃ¢ÂÂs earnest, dutiful approach. The first three of its six episodes are not bad if you have a high tolerance for didactic kitchen-sink drama. The last three gain in intensity. The series becomes more chilling the more it departs from reality, with terrible events that are not unimaginable but still unrealised.

As the story slowly builds, Herman remains a fiery idealist, passionately and effectively played by Morgan Spector. Lindbergh is a threat to the familyÃ¢ÂÂs upwardly-mobile life and their civil rights, but Herman is determined to stand his ground. Bess wants above all to protect her family. Kazan brilliantly and sensitively makes her a woman of her time. As anti-Semitism becomes more virulent, Bess thoughtfully chooses when to argue with her husband, when to let him lead, and when itÃ¢ÂÂs time to insist that if he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt move the family out of danger and into Canada, she will. Their adolescent son, Sheldon, sees Lindbergh only as a dashing pilot, conveying the perils of celebrity hero-worship. The younger son, Philip, takes it all in, an increasingly frightened child. The brown palette of the LevinsÃ¢ÂÂs world looks perfect in its drabness, from the shabby but pristine rowhouse to BessÃ¢ÂÂs practical cotton housedresses.

The extended family comes to include Lionel Bengelsdorf, a rabbi with Confederate ancestors, who is also an outspoken Lindbergh supporter, swallowing the idea that being pro-Hitler is a justified defence against communism. Played by John Turturro with a dripping Southern accent, Bengelsdorf is a problematic, unexplored character. We never quite see why he is so gullible.

Evelyn, sophisticated and lonely, cares for her ailing mother. She eagerly becomes BengelsdorfÃ¢ÂÂs assistant and then his fiancÃÂ©e. Ryder is triumphant in a role much enhanced from the book, as she makes EvelynÃ¢ÂÂs self-delusion painfully clear. Bengelsdorf is rich, attentive, and has access to powerful people. Evelyn lets herself ignore all the political warning signs, and even enrols Sheldon in her fiancÃÂ©eÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂJust FolksÃ¢ÂÂ program, sending Jewish children for a summer in the rural US in a barely-veiled attempt to dilute their ethnicity.

The conclusion is moving and more pessimistic about the possibilities for equality in the US than Roth was

But all this powerful acting is often saddled with sledgehammer dialogue drawing parallels to today. When swastikas are drawn on headstones at a Jewish cemetery, HermanÃ¢ÂÂs brother Monty (David Krumholtz) blames the president. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂve always been here,Ã¢ÂÂ he says of the bigots, Ã¢ÂÂbut now itÃ¢ÂÂs like they have permission to crawl out from under a rockÃ¢ÂÂ. Similar lines have echoed through real life in the past few years. When Monty comes to tolerate Lindbergh, Herman is outraged. Ã¢ÂÂStock market is up, profits are up,Ã¢ÂÂ he yells. Ã¢ÂÂEverything else about Lindbergh, what he stands for, is forgotten!Ã¢ÂÂ That dialogue might as well be a giant finger pointing toward Trump. The line resonated more pointedly before the recent market collapse, of course. Even alternate histories have trouble keeping up.

Some scenes in the final episodes make it worth slogging through the early ones. Kazan is heartbreaking as she tries to calm a small boy on the phone, and fierce when she confronts her sister. When Lindbergh invites HitlerÃ¢ÂÂs Foreign Minister, Von Ribbentrop, to a White House dinner, Lionel and Evelyn are guests, giving cover to the idea that the president canÃ¢ÂÂt be anti-Semitic if he has invited a rabbi. Evelyn, blithely smiling, dances with Von Ribbentrop, her head so turned by the glamour that nothing else matters. At dinner Lionel quietly pushes aside the shrimp on his plate, and makes excuses when Lindbergh rudely snubs him. Here, finally, are dramatised scenes that are terrifying and eye-opening because they are so personal and specific. In those too-few moments, the series doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to tell us what to think.

The conclusion is moving and more pessimistic about the possibilities for equality in the US than Roth was. Yet even that sobering ending doesnÃ¢ÂÂt escape the tone of a classroom lecture. The Plot Against America has high, half-realised ambitions. Preaching to its audience didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to be one of them.

Of course, we found that women in the United States, too, struggled against the limitations of their prescribed roles. But in my childhood in the '70s and '80s in the shadow of Second Wave feminism, there was an assumption that as the laws changed to allow women more public participation, social norms would evolve too.

Many didn't. In the United States and other countries, attitudes about gender roles have proved remarkably persistent. A new United Nations Development Programme index on social norms related to gender suggests that bias forms the glass ceiling that blocks women's advancement in all aspects of their lives.

Almost 90% of the world's men, and women, are biased in some way against women, according to the Gender Social Norms Index. Half of men and women feel that men make better political leaders. More than 56% feel that men have more right to a job and/or make better business executives.

(CNN) Last week, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc and Matthew Perry took to their Instagram feeds to confirm the long-held suspicions of fans around the world: the ""Friends"" gang is getting back together for a reunion.

We don't know what form the show will take. But it puts a renewed and 21st century spotlight on the 1990s favorite -- which for many, defined a generation, and has for years after its run ended enjoyed enduring popularity in syndication and on Netflix . As even devoted fans can recognize now, ""Friends"" often ended up on the wrong side of cultural history, highlighting many troubling norms of its time. This reunion on HBO Max is a timely opportunity for fans and new observers to ponder exactly why many people still love this show, and to ask what the hopefully older, wiser group of ""Friends"" might potentially acknowledge on the Central Perk sofa, this time around. (Like CNN, HBO Max -- a streaming service set to launch in May -- is owned by Warner Media.)

For starters, the ""Friends"" reunion might take a stab at talking about the original show's glaring lack of diversity. While there were equivalent non-white sitcoms in the 1990s, it was a gigantic oversight for arguably the decade's biggest program -- set in one of the biggest, most diverse cities in the world -- to have such poor representation of anyone not straight, white, middle-class and thin.

David Schwimmer noted in a recent interview his awareness of the show's lack of diversity, suggesting there should be an ""all-black 'Friends' or an all-Asian 'Friends'."" Erika Alexander, a cast member of the show ""Living Single,"" which also portrayed a group of young single city-dwelling friends and debuted a year before ""Friends"" took to Twitter to point out what appeared to be a glaring assumption that such a show hadn't already existed. Schwimmer replied in a tweet: ""I didn't mean to imply Living Single hadn't existed or indeed hadn't come before Friends, which I knew it had.""

Compared to shows like ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"" which handled not only racial politics, but issues like generational and class divides with humor and elegance, ""Friends"" remained pretty static in its cozy middle-class bubble. Any point of difference was used as a kooky reference -- ""Phoebe used to be homeless, so she's super tough!"" -- rather than an opportunity to explore a potentially juicy theme or raise viewers' social consciousness.

Issues which shouldn't have been issues -- like Monica's childhood fatness -- were used for cheap, offensive laughs. Plump, clumsy, naive adolescent Monica (shown through frequent flashback scenes over the years) wasn't even allowed to have the same personality as thin, efficient, sharp Monica -- she was just a ""fun"" extra character who sometimes just showed up.

On the rare occasions someone who didn't fit the mold appeared on ""Friends,"" they were used as a foil for the main, L'Oreal-ready cast's experience. Take the treatment of Chandler's -- apparently, but not explicitly -- transgender dad, played by Kathleen Turner. Their identity wasn't ever addressed head-on in the show, but the general impression is that it's confusing, and therefore traumatic for Chandler. Their presentation is used as fodder for grim lines like, ""Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?"" It'd be cool to see that relationship discussed. For instance, Turner has said that she wouldn't accept the same role now.

Of course, there are other LGBTQ concerns the gang could talk about. One of the show's longest-running jokes -- introduced within the first few minutes of the 1994 pilot -- is that Ross was dumped by his first wife, Carol, for another woman, Susan. While it was unusual in the 1990s to feature a gay female couple on TV, and particularly groundbreaking for its time to feature them as parents, that visibility is undermined by the main joke being that it's embarrassing for Ross to have been dumped for another woman. From Ross's first meeting with her , Carol's girlfriend Susan is painted as an unreasonable baddie, and the pattern of gay-is-a-punchline is set up for many seasons thereafter. The Susan of 2020 would deserve to be portrayed now as a total hero for putting up with it all.

""Friends"" was hardly the only show of the era which failed to take gay female relationships seriously. When ""Sex and the City""'s Samantha started dating a woman in the show's fourth season, her friends' responses are initially snide and disrespectful. Her friend Charlotte remarks: ""Maybe she [Samantha] just ran out of men?"" It's used as just another instance in which Samantha is judged for her sexual proclivity by her supposedly enlightened pals.

The slut-shaming mentality of the 1990s also occasionally emerged on ""Friends."" One of the early sticking points of Richard and Monica's relationship is how many sexual partners Monica has had. When Monica reveals the number, Richard -- a friend of Monica's dad and portrayed by Tom Selleck -- sits down, breathing a relieved sigh: ""You had me thinking it was like, a fleet."" The strong implication is that had the number been higher, that would have been a problem. It's a weird point to focus on, considering Richard dating Monica, whom he has known since she was a baby, is the equivalent of Joey, in 2020, dating Ross and Rachel's daughter Emma.

You have to hope that if dating comes up among the ""Friends"" of 2020, they might at least advocate for doing a few things differently in retrospect -- and indeed, all sexual interactions. Joey's womanizing, Ross's history as a controlling, jealous boyfriend, and Chandler's cruel treatment of his girlfriend Janice, are well-documented. But some early events outside the main cast are more sinister. In season one, when Rachel's boyfriend Paolo gropes Phoebe while she's giving him a professional massage, the gang treats the incident as a form of cheating. Phoebe even apologizes to Rachel for the fact that Paolo ""made a move"" on her. Post #MeToo, that ""dramatic twist"" reads very differently.

Considering how little the show commented on the part where touching women without consent is actual assault, it stands out even more today how hyper-sensitive the gang were to entirely benign events involving women's bodies or parenting. When Carol breastfeeds her son, Ben, early on in ""Friends,"" Joey and Chandler make their horrified escape as soon as possible. This wasn't just a male thing on 1990s sitcoms, apparently; Carrie on ""Sex And the City"" legs it when she sees her friend Miranda feed her new baby. By contrast, actual problematic parenting -- see Ross hating on his son Ben's Barbie, and firing the male nanny for being ""too sensitive"" -- is seen as kind of cute. Less than two decades ago, men got credit just for being in the same room as their offspring.

So what might HBO Max's upcoming special have in store? You've gotta hope that by 2020, the gang has some perspective on the internalized -- and externalized -- misogyny of their show's youth. At the very least, they likely have a better understanding of the world beyond Central Perk, where objectifying women is bad, and ignoring stale gender binaries is good.

880,https://us.cnn.com/2017/12/20/opinions/what-its-like-to-be-me-disability-rebecca-cokley-opinion/index.html,"This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, "" What it's like to be me ,"" which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn't ask me. He didn't even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, ""While you're down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?""

At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: ""No!""

As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren't seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.

The delivery room wasn't my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn't always perfect for me growing up. My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, ""Kids like you don't go here, you go to the special school."" If it weren't for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.

I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be ""different"" in a way that he is not.

When he comes, I'll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I've always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.

With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist -- who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn't ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business. I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation -- which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.

I don't know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I've asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.

While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it's also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.

Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act is that it's easier for people with disabilities to become parents. It's natural to assume that once people with disabilities have remedies for discrimination and greater access to society, they'll do exactly what a lot of nondisabled people do: get married and have kids. This was always a logical conclusion to me, as both my parents were little people (which is rare -- 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it).

Growing up with a disability

My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world , affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.

My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.

I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor's and master's degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley with their two kids

I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith's latest film, ""Dogma,"" and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.

It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm -- and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.

All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the ""gay cancer,"" my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.

I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, ""We're here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They're no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we'd hope they would be here for us.""

And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.

'Mom, I think I want to be a clown'

When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. ""Mom, I think I want to be clown."" She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. ""What?"" she asked.

""Yeah, I think I want to be a clown."" We rode home in silence. I didn't realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.

I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.

Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller , an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read ""for fun.""

My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.

Taking this path was important to me -- and to my family as well.

Rebecca Cokley with her mom.

When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school. It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn't have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having ""midget midget"" shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.

Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.

My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos , the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job -- at Victoria's Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.

You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, ""You have to make someone want something they don't need and want to pay too much for it.""

My boss at Victoria's Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I'd have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.

I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They'd actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. ""Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit."" (We all wore black suits). ""Well, she's petite."" (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.

The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were ""fascinated"" with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, ""We could pick you up and walk out with you. We'd take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us."" I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened ""spidey sense"" because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.

Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth . I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away -- cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by ""staring at the new girl."" I have no memory of this.

Building a family

Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.

Patrick is average height and African-American. I'm a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I'm the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he's the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.

Rebbeca Hare and Patrick Cokley were married at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Columbia.

When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that's how those of us in the community refer to ""little people"") friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn't ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height -- they'd ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn't care either way.

I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama's White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, ""I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules."" And those are really the values that we stress as we're raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.

At age 6, Jackson's awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, ""Mom, you're white, Dad's black, and I'm peach."" His dad turned around and said ""Peach? You're black."" Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said ""Peach!"" This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.

We've purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It's important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.

Since we're raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband's childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can't -- and in some cases, shouldn't -- be the one to answer.

As a professional advocate, I've spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police -- Eric Garner , Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland -- were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.

Rebecca Cokley and President Obama pose for a snapshot.

Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now -- their curiosity, their feeling that they've never met a stranger, their trust in the world -- could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.

My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn't keep it from him.

Parenthood and activism: our forms of protest in the world

When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn't be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well . Whether it's forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the ""well-meaning"" nondisabled public for centuries.

No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.

Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent's disability. In my work as an advocate, I've spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.

If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language. Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like ""special needs,"" ""differently abled,"" or, in a pun on language from the past, ""handi-capable.""

These aren't words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with -- they were defined by society because the concept of ""disability"" makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It's a reminder that yes, we are different.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley and their kids in their Washington neighborhood.

But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that ""disability"" is something to be ashamed of -- say, by implying that someone shouldn't have more children because of one -- society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights. We didn't celebrate the 27th anniversary of the ""Americans with Special Needs Act"" this summer, after all.

The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT -- with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police -- and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.

They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live -- in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims

We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It's impossible not to -- and we would be irresponsible if we didn't.

We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don't have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women's march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn't I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, ""I am the mommy,"" but not a single one apologized to me.

As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don't know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don't care either way.

What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

According to Tacoma Police, officers responded about 3:45 p.m. Tuesday to a disturbance at an apartment in the 1800 block of South 82nd Street. When they arrived, they found a 61-year-old woman dead. She has since been identified as Sarann Suong, according to court documents.

Her 30-year-old son, Larry Suong, has been charged with first-degree murder and pleaded not guilty to her death. HeÃ¢ÂÂs in jail on a $1 million bond.

Police said Sarann Suong had just walked in her front door when her son attacked her, stabbing her multiple times in her face, head and neck.

According to court documents, her son said he stabbed her because he was not going to allow her to yell at him on that particular day. Neighbors told The News-Tribune that Sarann was a nice woman, but her son often caused trouble around the complex.

(CNN) For just a moment Wednesday night you might have thought President Donald Trump was at long last grasping the gravity of the coronavirus situation and taking the necessary steps to confront what may be the most serious crisis the country has faced since he took office -- one that could lead to the deaths of vast numbers of people.

Trump tried to give a serious address to the nation from the Oval Office, laying out a plan to tackle the pandemic. But it quickly became apparent that this was one more error-filled display in what has been a grotesque carnival of incompetence.

The Europe travel and cargo ban started making headlines around the world while the President was still on the air. Anxious families wondered how they'd get traveling children home. Importers were in shock.

But just moments after the speech ended, the Department of Homeland Security issued a "" clarification ."" Turns out Trump got much of it wrong , even though he was reading from a teleprompter.

DHS said the restriction would not apply to Americans or US residents and their families, and would cover only foreigners who over the past 14 days spent time in certain European countries. It doesn't cover cargo. In short, it's nothing like Trump's dramatic announcement. Instead, it's a partial ban on flights from the area known as Schengen, a 26-country European travel bloc. The White House issued the proclamation , confirming DHS's version. There was also no mention of 30 days.

It gets worse. Trump also announced what would have been a milestone in fighting the fast-spreading contagion. Leaders of the health insurance industry, he said, ""have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments."" That would have broken through one of the most dangerous obstacles to containment, allowing more Americans to seek the care they need without fear of bankruptcy. But that too was wrong.

The insurance industry corrected him, saying they have agreed to waive co-payments "" for testing, not for treatment ,"" a colossal difference from what Trump indicated.

How is it possible that the President of the United States gets so much wrong about something so important in a speech from the Oval Office? We don't know if his speechwriters got it wrong or if he somehow improvised. Either way, it's disastrous and unacceptable.

The frontrunner in the Democratic primary, former Vice President Joe Biden, by contrast, modeled a statesmanlike approach in remarks on Thursday, when he offered his own plans for addressing the virus and its associated economic perils. Taking aim at Trump's words from the night before, Biden urged Americans not to ""panic or fall back on xenophobia""; ""labeling Covid-19 a 'foreign virus' does not displace accountability for the misjudgments thus far"" of the Trump administration, Biden said.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has magnified the danger of everything we have seen from this president from the day he took office.

From the start of the epidemic, Trump did nothing but ignore, minimize and mislead the public, while draping himself in cringeworthy, unctuous praise from officials who diminished themselves to avoid upsetting him, after seeing how those who spoke the truth incurred his wrath.

When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Nancy Messonnier warned that the virus would inevitably spread and we should prepare, Trump was reportedly furious according to the Washington Post.

Trump called the response and news coverage about the gravity of the virus a "" hoax ,"" and his enablers at Fox News and elsewhere irresponsibly followed suit

When the US had two dozen cases and experts said more would come, he contradicted them, saying it was not inevitable

As the number of cases and deaths grew exponentially at home and abroad -- Italy has gone from three cases three weeks ago to more than 12,000 now -- Trump incessantly tweeted and repeatedly declared that the seasonal flu kills thousands, and we don't make such a fuss.

He kept that line in what was a downright bizarre press conference at CDC headquarters last week. ""The [virus] tests are all perfect,"" he gushed, adding outlandishly ""like the letter was perfect,"" a reference to his Ukraine impeachment case. ""It's all performing perfectly, now it's performing perfectly in all places. And how was the show last night? Did it get good ratings?"" He had been on Fox the night before. Amid the random topics, he managed to include multiple falsehoods about the virus, adding to the confusion in the official message to the public.

A reporter who was there said he found Trump's statements "" terrifying .""

The most troubling statement , in my view, came when he was asked whether people on a cruise ship should be brought ashore. ""I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship."" That adds to concerns about why the US is not testing more people, a concern made worse by Trump's Tuesday address, when he boasted that US numbers are better than Europe's. (Few US tests are the likely reason.)

It apparently took a collapse in stock prices to persuade the president that this is not a public relations and marketing problem that can be solved with ""alternative facts."" So, he wore his stern face to the Oval Office and addressed the nation.

America's European allies were not only baffled by what they heard, they were livid . In a rare statement criticizing the US, they strongly condemned Trump's decision, which many viewed as motivated by politics rather than science. ""The coronavirus is a global crisis,"" they said, ""it requires cooperation, rather than unilateral action."" Contrary to what Trump indicated in the speech, they said the travel ban was ""taken unilaterally and without consultation.""

This is but a small sliver of the mistakes and misguided moves by the President and an administration where the principal requirement for a top job is obsequious loyalty to the President.

On the whole, the Trump administration has been incompetent and ineffectual. According to Ashish Jha, head of Harvard's Global Health Institute, ""Our response is much, much worse than almost any other country that has been affected.""

The number of infections and deaths will continue climbing, and the top man in the government has undercut the efforts of the professionals and insulted US allies, showing himself incapable of handling the crisis. With the virus raging, countless lives will be lost. The President's inattention arguably delayed a stronger response, and his misrepresentations, self-serving messages, and incompetent actions have only added to the problem. It's time for Trump to stand aside and let qualified professionals do their jobs.","It's time to let the experts do their jobs, Mr. President","The Europe travel and cargo ban started making headlines around the world while the President was still on the air.

1051,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-schools.html,"A public hospital nurse, for example, would likely not be able to stay home from work even if her child was home from school. And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

Ã¢ÂÂThe downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the CouncilÃ¢ÂÂs health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving Ã¢ÂÂreports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,Ã¢ÂÂ said ScarsdaleÃ¢ÂÂs school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday. Ã¢ÂÂPreventative measures are only effective if we embrace and implement them as a community.Ã¢ÂÂ

Most public schools across the state remain open, with some major exceptions, including public schools in Scarsdale, East Ramapo, and New Rochelle in Westchester County, which is the epicenter of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs outbreak. Initially, only three New Rochelle public schools located in a one-mile Ã¢ÂÂcontainmentÃ¢ÂÂ zone closed earlier this week, but the entire district shut down on Friday following protests from families.

Inside New York CityÃ¢ÂÂs schools this week, educators were concerned and conflicted.

Ã¢ÂÂThankfully, itÃ¢ÂÂs not my decision,Ã¢ÂÂ said Liat Olenick, a teacher at the Brooklyn Arbor School in Williamsburg, of closure.

947,https://us.cnn.com/2016/02/21/opinions/scalia-argument-capital-punishment-prejean/index.html,"Sister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of "" Dead Man Walking ."" The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.

As I was writing ""The Death of Innocents,"" I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was ""taking him on"" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, ""And I'll be right back at ya!""

In ""Innocents,"" I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the ""machinery of death.""

In grasping the ""meaning"" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.

One thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his ""originalist"" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.

After all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal ""experts,"" every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?

I have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.

As for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.

Given what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.

In 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.

I say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in""The Death of Innocents,"" taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.

Three years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments.""

In his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of ""idiot"" as ""such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is."" According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's ""idiot"" test.

My second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.

These stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by ""modern trends,"" as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.

Thus, Scalia could not brook American bishops' increasing opposition to the death penalty, nor the opposition of Popes John Paul II and Francis -- especially Pope Francis, who must have disturbed the justice considerably in his bold appeal before Congress for global abolition of the death penalty.

-- ""It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States.""

-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, ""The powers that be are ordained of God,"" to mean: ""Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy.""

Democracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.

Where was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking ""an eye for an eye,"" to pray for and forgive our enemies?

In Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.

In this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem ""enemy.""

It seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.

I also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom ""equal justice under law"" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.",My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"Photos: Death row's nun Sister Helen Prejean has been on a mission to end the death penalty for three decades.

466,https://us.cnn.com/2019/08/04/tech/nasa-management-apollo-silicon-valley-scn/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Silicon Valley, its visionaries like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and the entire tech revolution may not have happened without the Cold War space race.

President John F. Kennedy's iconic 1962 speech, directing the United States to put boots on the moon within the decade, set in motion a leap in innovation. In just seven years, America went from lagging the Soviet Union in space technology to planting a flag on the lunar surface.

The Apollo program was the birthplace of the modern tech ecosystem, says Basil Hero, a former investigative reporter and media executive who authored the new book "" The Mission of a Lifetime .""

""Without [Apollo], I don't think the computer revolution would have happened as quickly and on the same trajectory,"" Hero told CNN Business. ""It would have taken an extra 10 or 20 years.""

Apollo, the startup

NASA's Apollo program was the first-ever ""moonshot."" And the ingredients that led to its success were a whatever-it-takes attitude, loose management structures, and deep funding.

Kennedy estimated early on that the first moon landing would cost about $7 billion to $9 billion. But the first thing James E. Webb did when he became NASA's administrator in 1961 was tell Kennedy to double that amount. It was a move ""any venture capitalist who has funded a high-tech startup would understand,"" Hero writes in ""The Mission of a Lifetime.""

The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is insisting they can launch their companies on the cheap, Hero said. They can end up low-balling their way out of business.

Congress was the Apollo program's financial backer, writing big checks year after year. Lawmakers even authorized NASA in 1962 to offer ""supergrade"" salaries so that the space agency could afford to hire the best and brightest, Hero notes in his book.

But, NASA could not lumber along as a bureaucratic regime if it wanted to blast humans to the moon in less than 10 years.

Enter George Mueller . He left a prestigious career at research groups such as Bell Labs to lead NASA's human spaceflight program in 1963. The space agency's history office describes him as ""a no-nonsense, forward-thinking leader"" who ""introduced a remarkable series of management changes.""

Mueller created a ""flat organization"" structure: He cut out middle management and ""made sure that the engineers on the front line were able to get their concerns straight up to the top people of NASA,"" Hero said. If safety concerns were raised or an idea just wasn't working out, decision makers listened and quickly shifted course.

""They really did trust people in the lower levels, and the engineers benefited from that,"" Hero said.

Today, California's hive of startups and tech giants, from Facebook to Google , still swear by the same management technique.

Netflix NFLX ""Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them,"" notes in its widely influential workplace culture manifesto. ""We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix Ã¢ÂÂ giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions.""

Apollo managers also had no problem bringing in young visionaries to take on unprecedented tasks, a move emulated by Silicon Valley and its obsession with young minds thinking outside the box.

Mission Control in Houston, Texas, for example, was an operation that had no precursor, and no one knew how to run it. So its manager, Christopher Kraft, brought in a bunch of ambitious 20-somethings. The average age of Mission Control employees during the Apollo 11 moon landing was just 26, Hero notes.

Making more moonshots

In terms of computing power, a modern cellphone could outdo the entire Apollo spacecraft, physicist Michio Kaku wrote in a 2011 book

The digital revolution that followed Apollo was no accident. Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs built off computing technology that NASA incubated during the Apollo era, Hero said.

Some of the tech titans that dominate today's headlines credit NASA and Apollo as a source of inspiration, and a few have Apollo-like ambitions of their own.

(CNN) As the coronavirus continues to spread and the number of infected individuals surpasses 100,000 , President Donald Trump and his allies are doing their best to convince Americans that it's not a major cause for concern and may actually have some benefits for the American economy.

Last Wednesday, Trump told Fox News viewers he had a ""hunch"" that WHO estimates on the virus's mortality rate were wrong and that many Americans infected with the virus could continue to go to work. Trump surrogate Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida emphasized the ""hilarity"" of the virus by wearing a gas mask during the House vote on funding to fight the virus.

Days after his gas mask stunt, Florida officials announced that the coronavirus had killed one of Gaetz's constituents. And Monday afternoon, Gaetz announced he was self-quarantining after being informed a person he had contact with during last week's CPAC conference had since tested positive for coronavirus. He had spent the weekend with Trump at his resort in Florida.

But by far the most prevalent party line among those seeking to distract from the Trump administration's early bungling of their response to the coronavirus has been reassuring the public that the virus really ""only"" severely impacts chronically ill or elderly Americans, so the average American shouldn't worry

In case the President and his allies have forgotten, let me remind you: elderly and chronically ill Americans are still, well, Americans. Our lives matter every bit as much as those of our healthy neighbors. And in a nation where, according to the CDC, six in 10 American adults live with at least one chronic disease, the potential impact of a highly communicable virus is much larger than one man's reelection chances. Government officials have an obligation to not only implement policies that keep Americans as a whole safe in the face of potential pandemics but also take every step necessary to make sure that disabled and chronically ill people are shielded from the harm those policies might cause them.

Thus far, Trump and his coronavirus ""task force"" seem largely focused on staging PR events designed to limit the President's political exposure. Trump appeared confused about the differences between vaccines (which would help prevent the spread of the virus) and therapeutic medications (whose purpose is to treat those infected with the virus) during last Monday's bizarre roundtable event with pharmaceutical executives, for example, which only highlighted just how little he understands about the situation.

But elected officials in Washington should be focused on taking steps to proactively limit the very real harm that could come to disabled and chronically ill Americans -- who the Trump administration has acknowledged are most at risk -- as the coronavirus continues to spread.

Congress has primarily focused on funding for the coronavirus response, passing an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill, which Trump signed into law Friday morning. The bipartisan bill, which was more than three times the size of the Trump administration's initial request, is certainly a critical part of the coronavirus response by federal, state and local health officials. But the funding bill does little to address the specific risks that chronically ill Americans face in the event of the coronavirus spreading.

Those risks are not limited to the coronavirus itself. In fact, some of the preventative measures the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued could inadvertently harm America's most medically fragile citizens unless steps are taken immediately to mitigate those dangers.

Chief among them is the impact of social distancing -- which includes avoiding large gatherings or public transportation, for example, in an effort to slow the spread of contagious diseases.

If the United States health care system becomes overwhelmed with coronavirus cases and social distancing measures are implemented, millions of chronically ill Americans who rely on one or more prescription medications need access to an emergency stockpile. The CDC's guidance for normal preparedness recommends Americans ""keep at least a 7 to 10-day supply of prescription medications,"" although some health care professionals are currently recommending patients obtain a 30-day supply whenever possible.

This represents a huge problem. Most payers (including Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance companies) have restrictions on how often they will cover the cost of refilling a member's prescription medications, often limiting patients to 30-day supplies with a short two- to three-day window for refills prior to a medication running out. These payers will most likely cover the cost of an emergency supply of medications only if forced to do so by law -- a law that Congress can and should take immediate steps to implement.

Further complicating things, millions of Americans (myself included) rely on controlled substances to manage chronic pain and other health conditions such as anxiety and ADHD. Due to increasingly restrictive state and federal laws on Schedule II, III and IV drugs in America -- including opioid pain medications and those meant for the treatment of anxiety disorders -- obtaining these medications frequently requires monthly doctor visits and urinalysis tests, and the medications often cannot be purchased in advance at all. Not only are these medications crucial for maintaining basic quality of life for millions of Americans, many of them also carry the potential for severe withdrawal symptoms that are worsened by a patient stopping the medication cold turkey, putting patients at severe risk in the event of social distancing measures preventing their refills.

Even if strict social distancing measures are not implemented in America, requiring chronically ill patients -- who are often immunocompromised -- to physically visit their doctors' office to obtain their monthly prescriptions while the coronavirus is still active in America puts those patients at higher risk of coming into contact with an infected person, increasing the chances of the virus continuing to spread and putting all of us at higher risk.

Under the Public Health Service Act, some of these issues could be addressed under the authority of the secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. In January, Azar declared a public health emergency nationwide in regard to the coronavirus. Under this declaration, Azar has the authority to waive many of the restrictions and requirements relating to the dispensing of prescription medications.

But his authority as it relates to private health insurance companies is limited. Even if Azar waived the restrictions and requirements on dispensing opioids, the issue of how millions of Americans who rely on private health insurance would cover the cost would be left to Congress to solve. And given the Trump administration's focus on increasing restrictions surrounding opioids -- and Trump's frequently stated desire to make drug laws even harsher -- it is unlikely that Azar would exercise this right.

In the meantime, it's clear that Americans cannot afford to wait around for the Trump administration to take action. Congress must move to pass legislation that allows for the adjustment of prescription medication laws in the event of an emergency such as the coronavirus. If social distancing begins to be implemented, it is critical that the government allow patients to obtain a 30-day emergency reserve supply of their prescription medications, temporarily waive requirements for patients to attend in-person doctor visits and urinalysis tests, and require that both government and private health care payers cover the cost of a small emergency supply of all prescription medications.","I'm chronically ill, and this is what Congress can do to protect me","Congress has primarily focused on funding for the coronavirus response, passing an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill, which Trump signed into law Friday morning.

653,https://us.cnn.com/2020/01/30/africa/south-africans-stranded-wuhan-intl/index.html,"(CNN) South Africans in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, have expressed frustration about their government's lack of evacuation plans from the city.

Nearly 60 million people are under partial or full lockdowns in cities in China as the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread across Asia and the rest of the world . At least 170 people are dead, and more than 7,700 cases have been confirmed in mainland China since the outbreak began in December.

Several countries, including the US and Japan, have flown hundreds of their citizens out of the city.

South African Pieter Viljoen, who traveled with a colleague to Wuhan for a business conference before the city's transport lockdown began, said the authorities in South Africa and its embassy in Beijing have not provided support or information about plans to repatriate them.

South Africa's embassy in Beijing also declined to help when his company made private arrangements to secure a flight to get them out of the country and requested assistance and documentation to begin their evacuation process, he says.

Viljoen said dozens of South Africans caught in the city's lockdown have also complained about the South African government's lack of communication in a WeChat group created to share information about the situation.

""We are not getting any real assistance. The only information from the South African embassy is that we must comply with local authorities. In terms of leaving Wuhan, there has been no effort or communication about evacuation,"" Viljoen said.

Viljoen said he has remained in his hotel, which has shut down operations partially since the movement restriction put in place to help check the spread of the deadly virus.

Supermarkets and grocery stores around his hotel in Wuhan's Optics Valley area are running out of supplies, he said.

""You have only these small supermarkets where you can get food right now because of the complete lockdown. You can't move around from one district to another, so supplies are not readily available,"" Viljoen told CNN on telephone.

South Africa's embassy in Beijing declined to comment on Viljoen's allegations and directed CNN's request for comment to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO).

The embassy had closed on January 26 for the Lunar New Year holiday and full operations only resumed Thursday, according to DIRCO . Emergency contact numbers manned by embassy staff were available for citizens in need of assistance to call during the holiday, the department added.

DIRCO spokesman Clayson Monyela told CNN on Thursday that the South African government and its health ministry was working on all requests. However, they must also consider travel and quarantine measures imposed by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of the virus.

""We are not ignoring their plight, and we are quite aware of the need for speed to assist our citizens in Wuhan. We are liaising with the mission in Beijing to see how we can respond to the situation within the present context,"" Monyela said.

South Africa's opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which said it was in touch with more than 100 South Africans in China, called on the foreign ministry to address the ""dysfunction"" at the county's embassy in China, which it said had affected efforts to help stranded citizens.

""The Department needs to ensure that its mission is able to communicate and allay fears by providing clear and helpful communication and assistance at the same standard of other countries that have heeded the call,"" it said in a statement Wednesday.

Uncertain future

Despite growing calls for repatriation, South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday said there were no plans to fly its citizens out as Chinese authorities have the outbreak under control.

""The Chinese government has assured us that there is no evidence to necessitate the evacuation of foreign nationals living in Wuhan city, and they have called for calm in this respect,"" Mkhize said.

He added that they have been assured by the Chinese government that foreign nationals who fall sick will be treated in the same way as Chinese citizens.

South African Jessika Bailing says she feels neglected by her country's government.

The 23-year-old English teacher, who moved from South Africa to Wuhan last year, said while many countries are racing to get their citizens out of the city, authorities in South Africa were reluctant to make such arrangements.

""I've watched other countries' governments go above and beyond to evacuate their citizens and then we are faced with that kind of response from our government, how can one not feel abandoned?"" Bailing said.

""The South African government may be putting things into place or trying to find some solutions to get the South Africans in Wuhan evacuated but neither me nor any other South African I have been in contact with feels that they are,"" she added.

Dustin Emslie says he's disappointed by the South African government's response to the situation.

""I didn't really expect the government to evacuate us, I just hoped there would be more concern for South African citizens abroad,"" he said.

Emslie, who has lived in Wuhan for six years, said he would leave with his Chinese wife and 3-year-old daughter, only if the whole family will go.

""If I had to leave, it would only be if they could come with me to South Africa. There is no way I'm just going to abandon them here,"" he said.

He says while locals and expatriates have been trying to cope with the restrictions. The uncertainty about when the lockdown will end has been the hardest to bear.

""We have no idea when this epidemic will end. It could be months that we are under lockdown here in Wuhan,"" he wrote in a text message.

#KenyansinWuhan

Many Kenyans trapped in Wuhan have also taken to social media under the hashtag #KenyansinWuhan asking their government to evacuate them from the city.

A Kenyan student at the Wuhan University of Technology, who wanted to stay anonymous due to his status as a foreign student, said he now fears for his safety as the coronavirus death toll continues to rise.

""Imagine not being able to open the door to a friend because you don't know if they are infected; it is freaking me out,"" he said.

He also said that buses, taxis, and ride-hailing apps were not working, and the only way to get around was on foot or by bicycle.

Antony Waigwa, a Kenyan student at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan told CNN that Chinese authorities have been providing free food and electricity for many students at the institute since the lockdown.

State-owned telecoms company China Unicom has also given access to free internet services so that students can communicate and inform authorities about any development while the movement restriction lasts.

""Insurance companies have also removed limits to our cover so we can get treated till we fully recover if we contract the disease,"" Waigwa told CNN.

In a statement sent to its citizens living in China on Tuesday, the Kenyan embassy in Beijing said that the Chinese authorities had assured foreign governments not to panic and evacuation was not necessary at this stage.

The repatriation process could also take two weeks as Chinese authorities will only facilitate evacuation when foreign nationals have met all quarantine processes, including 14 days of no contact with the virus, the statement said.

It added that though the coronavirus outbreak is ""severe"", the embassy was confident in the Chinese government's efforts to contain it.

The spread of the virus has prompted some airlines to cancel flights to China , and several countries have placed people traveling from Wuhan under quarantine.

The Ivory Coast put a student who had returned from Beijing with coronavirus symptoms under observation on Saturday pending her test results.

The Nigerian government on Thursday said it will begin screening Chinese nationals traveling to the West African nation for the virus. Ethiopia and Kenya have placed passengers returning from areas hit by the virus under isolation. The World Health Organization on Tuesday said there had been no confirmed cases on the continent.",South Africans in Wuhan lockdown call for evacuation,"(CNN) South Africans in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, have expressed frustration about their government's lack of evacuation plans from the city.

1085,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/live-stock-market.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin vowed on Friday that the United States government would do whatever was necessary to ensure that markets have Ã¢ÂÂalmost unlimitedÃ¢ÂÂ liquidity. He said that the economic relief package being negotiated with Congress was just the beginning of efforts to stimulate the economy in the wake of the coronavirus.

Ã¢ÂÂI think weÃ¢ÂÂre like in the second inning of getting things done,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC.

The Trump administration is considering additional relief measures, including a payroll tax holiday. Mr. Mnuchin also said that the administration is working on exemptions from tariffs imposed by President Trump that are affecting businesses, and that he would be open to waiving restrictions on withdrawals for 401(k) investments so that people can more readily access their savings.

The Treasury secretary dismissed rumors that markets could shut down because of the recent volatility, and he encouraged banks to turn to the Federal ReserveÃ¢ÂÂs discount window for funding if needed.

Mr. Mnuchin expressed optimism that the current Ã¢ÂÂblack swanÃ¢ÂÂ period would be over in a matter of months, and pent-up demand would jump-start the economy.

A split in Congress: Who should be paid not to work?

A fundamental divide over how many Americans should be paid to stay home from work amid the coronavirus outbreak has emerged as one snag in negotiations over a multibillion-dollar federal response to the mounting health and economic damage from the virus.

House Democrats are set to vote Friday on a bill, negotiated with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that includes several measures meant to combat the spread of the virus and cushion its economic shock to the economy. One of those is a plan to provide paid leave to workers affected by the virus.

A key question is how many workers should be covered by that leave plan, which would ensure compensation for people who do not go to work during the outbreak. Many Republicans want to keep it focused narrowly to workers who have contracted the virus or are forced to care for sick family members or children whose schools have closed Ã¢ÂÂ and they are concerned that the bill, more broadly written, could also encourage healthy people to stay home, thus chilling economic activity.",Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin vowed on Friday that the United States government would do whatever was necessary to ensure that markets have Ã¢ÂÂalmost unlimitedÃ¢ÂÂ liquidity.

588,https://us.cnn.com/2018/01/31/health/meaning-of-life-wisdom-project/index.html,"This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan .

It's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- both philosophically and practically, in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we rarely, if ever, stop to really think about the answer.

Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous.

And having an answer may even improve your health and help you live longer.

After studying 1,300 subjects from ages 21 to more than 100, the authors found that older people were more likely to have found their life's purpose, while younger people were more likely still searching. That's logical, given that wisdom is often born from experience. According to research by Stanford education professor William Damon, the author of ""The Path to Purpose,"" only 20% of young adults have a fully realized sense of their life's meaning.

And according to the new study, the presence of meaning in one's life showed a positive correlation to one's health, including improved cognitive function, while searching for it may have a slight negative effect. Mental and physical well-being was self-reported, and having a sense of purpose tended to peak around age 60, the study found.

than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered. According to two other studies published in 2014 -- one among 9,000 participants over age 65 and another among 6,000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives lived longerthan those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.

The connection to longevity could be causal -- having purpose may help one cope with daily stress , as other research has shown -- but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.

Or as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is quoted as saying, ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how,"" nicely summing up the connection between having purpose and forbearance in one's life.

Starting an annual meaning of life resolution

The easiest but perhaps healthiest resolution you could make in the New Year may be to simply ask yourself what the meaning of life is for you. What gives you purpose? Why are we all here?

Every January for more than two decades, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question.

The reason I ask it annually is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time.

Great thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is ""to serve others and to do good,"" and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, ""The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity."" And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, ""if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.""

Scottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, ""The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit."" And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to ""throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.""

""Love"" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, ""The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.""

My favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, ""The purpose of life is a life of purpose.""

Some have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. ""There is not one big cosmic meaning for all,"" AnaÃÂ¯s Nin wrote in her diary. ""There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.""

I agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. ""Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded,"" wrote Antoine de Saint-ExupÃÂ©ry, well-known for his book ""The Little Prince.""

Taking a few moments to record your answer to the question ""what is the meaning of life?"" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life.

And then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding.

In 1997, my answer was ""the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss,"" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make ""the world a better place."" In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply ""Love."" And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic ""continuation of one's DNA to the next generation."" But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others.

Subscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.

As a practical matter, if you want to do the annual ""Meaning"" exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.

The last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If ""love,"" is the answer, then love more. If it's ""find your bliss,"" then get searching for it.

476,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/02/business/bumble-bee-tuna-new-package-good-catch/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) It may not seem like the best time to be in charge of Bumble Bee.

The canned tuna industry has faced all manner of scandals over the past several years. Along with its competitors, Bumble Bee was implicated in a price-fixing scheme four years ago. Bumble Bee agreed to plead guilty for its role in the conspiracy and to pay a $25 million criminal fine. And last year, the company filed for bankruptcy , blaming its ""recent and significant legal challenges."" It has since been acquired by FCF, a Taiwanese fishing company.

The industry has also been plagued by criticism over its fishing practices, which have unintentionally netted dolphins and other marine life. It has also faced claims of human rights violations along its supply chains.

Bumble Bee is coming out with new packaging and new products this year. Its old logo, seen here, will get a makeover.

And Americans are eating less canned tuna. According to a 2018 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, annual per capita consumption of canned tuna has been falling steadily for decades, from 3.7 pounds in 1990 to 2.1 pounds in 2018.

But Jan Tharp, Bumble Bee's CEO since 2018, says things are looking up.

""We are super excited about our future,"" she told CNN Business.

Over the past year and a half, she said, Bumble Bee has been working behind the scenes to revitalize its business. Now, the company is ready to reveal some of its efforts, including new products, a sleek, updated design and a partnership with a plant-based tuna company.

New products and a new look

Bumble Bee is chasing customers by revamping its own image.

For too long, Bumble Bee failed to keep up with the times. New products and new packaging can help, said Tharp.

Tuna should be on-trend, she argued. It's a good source of protein that is low in calories and free of sugar. ""There's absolutely no reason why the category should be down,"" she said. Overall, she said ""the industry can do a better job"" of selling its product.

Younger eaters ""don't like status quo,"" said Brian Choi, managing partner and CEO at the Food Institute, a food industry news and market research company. ""They're looking for bolder flavors,"" he added.

To better connect with today's consumers, Bumble Bee spoke to about 10,000 customers over the course of a year, Tharp said, to get a better sense of what they're looking for. They kept those insights in mind when developing new products and packaging.

Bumble Bee is rolling out new products, and bringing a version of its ""Bistro Bowl,"" now sold in Canada under the Clover Leaf label, to the United States.

This year, Bumble Bee plans to start selling new microwavable ""bistro bowls,"" low-calorie meals containing tuna, vegetables, and rice or pasta. It is also rolling out new ""protein-on-the-run"" snack packs, with crackers, a sea salt caramel chew and tuna in olive oil and zesty lemon, black pepper or sweet jalapeno. And it's launching nine flavors of tuna in pouches, equipped with a spork so people can eat on the run, as well as a similar product in an easy-to-open can with a clear lid.

The company has already been selling tuna in pouches, and the format is performing well. Sales of the product popped 40% by volume in 2019, according to the company.

In addition to launching new flavors and packages, Bumble Bee is rolling out a new, nautical look. Gone is the chef-bee mascot, which can be found peeking over labels on some cans and pouches.

The new packaging calls out the amount of protein per container, features images of the ingredients lending flavor (like onions and chili pepper) and has new messaging. One pack reads ""bee well for life,"" positioning the product as a health food.

In addition to revamping its own image, Bumble Bee is partnering with a plant-based tuna company to attract new customers.

Moving in on plant-based tuna

Beyond Meat BYND Interest in plant-based alternatives to animal products has exploded. The trend kicked off with dairy substitutes, like soy and almond milk, and has been gaining steam with meat substitutes popularized by Impossible Foods and

Many expect plant-based seafood to be the next big thing. Tharp agrees.

""Seafood is coming,"" she said. ""Our customers are looking for that type of option.""

Bumble Bee had been looking for ways to get into the plant-based space for years, said Tharp. But it was having a hard time developing plant-based seafood on its own. So it decided to go into business with Gathered Foods Corporation, which owns plant-based seafood company Good Catch.

Bumble Bee plans to help with Good Catch's sales and distribution through the joint venture.

Good Catch makes plant-based tuna out of legumes.

The partnership is a ""win-win,"" said Tharp. It should help Good Catch scale, and give Bumble Bee a way into a potentially lucrative market. Barclays has predicted that the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion in sales within the next ten years. And the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports plant-based businesses, wrote in a 2019 report that plant-based seafood could ""potentially exceed growth rates in the broader plant-based meat category.""

The Good Catch deal may also help convince customers that Bumble Bee is serious about sustainability.

People who are concerned about meat's environmental impact may have similar concerns over fish. Lost or discarded fishing equipment contributes to plastic waste in the ocean and poses a threat to marine life. Plastic pollution could be dangerous for people, too, if microplastics end up in our food supply. Sustainability is a concern among young people especially, noted Choi.

""We do understand and share the concern regarding the impact of plastic in the ocean, especially as it relates to the pollution aspect of it as well as human health,"" said Tharp. ""We do take that subject extremely seriously, and we know that there's a lot of work and research that still has to be done.""

Bumble Bee is working with the National Fisheries Institute and Michigan State University to support research in the area, she said, adding that it has also joined the Global Ghost Gear Initiative, which aims to remove fishing debris from the ocean.

The company is also working to mitigate its impact on the ocean and marine life by tracing where its products come from. It is also is working with third-party auditors to try to enforce better conditions on fishing boats and in factories, Tharp said.",New packaging and plant-based fish: How Bumble Bee tuna is trying to make a comeback,"New York (CNN Business) It may not seem like the best time to be in charge of Bumble Bee.

403,https://us.cnn.com/style/article/china-beijing-silvermine-negatives/index.html,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

For the last decade, Thomas Sauvin has been purchasing discarded color negatives by the kilogram from a recycling plant outside Beijing. The old 35-millimeter films capture family outings, weddings, birthdays, vacations -- anonymous, everyday memories that would otherwise be lost.

The trader he buys them from, Xiao Ma, usually dissolves the negatives in acid, alongside hospital X-rays and old CD-ROMs, in order to extract the small amount of silver within. But instead, Sauvin takes them away in big rice sacks to find out what else they contain.

Quite how the negatives found their way into people's trash remains a mystery to the French collector and artist. But with the help of a local technician, he scans them in batches before adding the images to his archive.

His ongoing ""Beijing Silvermine"" project paints a compelling picture of a country undergoing profound change. The collection -- which comprises 850,000 photos -- offers an ordinary perspective on life in China that is often overlooked, said Sauvin, who lived in Beijing for over 12 years.

""The way China was depicted through contemporary photography, propaganda and journalism (offered) a portrait far from the one I was witnessing,"" he said in a phone interview. ""There was something more universal, something about collective memories, that started emerging. The photos show a side of China that was never really exported to the West.""

While the resulting images can be, at times, inexplicably surreal (an old man standing in a cacti bush, or a woman posing next to a fake shark), they are often mundane. Yet, after spending a year and half ""looking for gems,"" Sauvin realized that the strength of his archive lay not in occasional humorous discoveries, but in the bigger picture that emerged.

Most of the images were taken between 1985 and the mid-2000s, when the widespread adoption of digital cameras made film largely obsolete. It was a time of rapid economic development, and the photos show how this played out in people's lives: families posing with new household appliances or standing with statues of Ronald McDonald after fast food arrived in China in the early 1990s.

The pictures also document people's changing relationship with the medium of photography, as cameras went from expensive luxuries to everyday items.

""I have one (roll of) film -- 36 images -- that was shot over three-and-a-half years,"" Sauvin said. ""You have three consecutive birthdays of the same person. You can imagine, on very important occasions, the parents would bring out this analog camera, take one photo and then wait six months before taking another one.

""But by 2005, as analog photography becomes (more affordable), you notice that people would go to somewhere like the Summer Palace and take 36 photos in 30 minutes.""

Recurring themes

What remains consistent throughout this period, however, is the pictures' composition and what Sauvin calls ""the ritual"" of photography. Almost all of the images show subjects standing at the center and looking out to the camera.

Some common themes also emerge: women posing with flowers, twins dressed in identical clothing and people interacting with statues or public sculptures. Indeed, the collector found so many photos of people smoking at weddings (Chinese brides would often light cigarettes for male guests as thanks for their attendance) that he was able to publish an entire book of them.

New ideas constantly emerge from the collection. Sauvin's latest exhibition brings together photos from a Beijing amusement park filled with miniature replicas of famous world monuments, from the Kremlin to the Eiffel Tower. Opened in 1993, Beijing World Park encouraged visitors to collect a stamp from each landmark in a mock passport (""Go around the world in just one day,"" its catalog boasted).

What initially appears as a vintage oddity, however, tells a wider story about the country's rise. The exhibition juxtaposes photos of people next to replica landmarks with those of Chinese tourists in front of the real thing. In doing so, he explores how an evident curiosity about the outside world was satiated by the newfound income to holiday around the world.

""It seems to be quite a meaningful place,"" Sauvin said of Beijing World Park, which remains open to this day. ""It was like an educational place for people to start understanding what traveling and tourism was all about.""

Fading memories

Sauvin has become adept at deciphering where, and in what circumstances, old photos may have been taken. But it took seven years for a subject to ever identify themselves in one of his pictures.

The image in question depicts a middle-aged man laid out on rocks beside a lake (""like a mermaid,"" as the collector put it). It was a personal favorite of Sauvin's, and thus had appeared in exhibitions, posters, flyers and even as a sticker. Indeed, he had spent so much time looking at the man's image that he ""knew the guy like he was my grandfather.""

After Sauvin posted the photo on China's Twitter-like microblogging platform, Weibo, a user recognized the subject as his ex-girlfriend's father. Some messages later, the artist met the man at a Beijing restaurant in 2016 -- almost 30 years after the photo was taken by colleagues at an engineering conference.

""He was very happy, and we had a very good time,"" Sauvin said. ""In the end, I offered him a framed copy of the photo and he asked me to sign it. He looked at his wife and said, 'In a couple of years that's going to be worth a lot of money!'""

Although now based in Paris, Sauvin still visits Beijing four or five times a year. The recycler Xiao Ma calls whenever he has recovered enough negatives for a 50-kilogram bag. The price has almost tripled in the decade since the project began, rising from 28 yuan ($4) a kilogram to a ""still very reasonable"" 75 yuan (just under $11).

""It's always a bit of a gamble, because sometimes a 50-kilo bag only comes from one source -- and if that source isn't interesting, then I've just spent 400 Euros,"" he said. ""But that's part of the game, I suppose.""

The supply of negatives may soon run dry. Xiao extracts the most silver from X-rays, but Sauvin said that Chinese hospitals have gone digital, making the trade far less lucrative. But Sauvin also sources negatives from eBay-like websites and visits flea markets, which is where he stumbled across his latest project: old prints hidden in a plastic bag.

""I asked the vendor if I could open it and check inside,"" Sauvin recalled. ""And he said, 'No, you have to buy it.'""

He took the risk. After parting with around 450 yuan ($64), Sauvin looked inside to reveal a series of black-and-white photos depicting athletes mid-leap, their gravity-defying poses assuming an almost sculptural quality.

Sauvin's latest project brings together found photos of athletes from a single day in 1960. Credit: Courtesy Thomas Sauvin

Further investigation revealed that the pictures had been taken by the photography department at Xi'an Physical Education University, in China's Shaanxi province. All had been shot in a single day in June 1960 -- at the height of Mao's Great Leap Forward, the disastrous modernization campaign that plunged the country into economic chaos and famine.

""I've never managed to find a significant number of photos from this era. People were obviously not going to photo studios, because it was a very hard time,"" said Sauvin, who has compiled the images into a new book, ""Great Leaps Forward.""

He said that the economic relief package being negotiated with Congress was just the beginning of efforts to stimulate the economy in the wake of the coronavirus.

Ã¢ÂÂI think weÃ¢ÂÂre like in the second inning of getting things done,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC.

The Trump administration is considering additional relief measures, including a payroll tax holiday. Mr. Mnuchin also said that the administration is working on exemptions from tariffs imposed by President Trump that are affecting businesses, and that he would be open to waiving restrictions on withdrawals for 401(k) investments so that people can more readily access their savings.

The Treasury secretary dismissed rumors that markets could shut down because of the recent volatility, and he encouraged banks to turn to the Federal ReserveÃ¢ÂÂs discount window for funding if needed.

Mr. Mnuchin expressed optimism that the current Ã¢ÂÂblack swanÃ¢ÂÂ period would be over in a matter of months, and pent-up demand would jump-start the economy.

A split in Congress: Who should be paid not to work?

A fundamental divide over how many Americans should be paid to stay home from work amid the coronavirus outbreak has emerged as one snag in negotiations over a multibillion-dollar federal response to the mounting health and economic damage from the virus.

House Democrats are set to vote Friday on a bill, negotiated with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that includes several measures meant to combat the spread of the virus and cushion its economic shock to the economy. One of those is a plan to provide paid leave to workers affected by the virus.

A key question is how many workers should be covered by that leave plan, which would ensure compensation for people who do not go to work during the outbreak. Many Republicans want to keep it focused narrowly to workers who have contracted the virus or are forced to care for sick family members or children whose schools have closed Ã¢ÂÂ and they are concerned that the bill, more broadly written, could also encourage healthy people to stay home, thus chilling economic activity.",Wall Street Rises After Historic Plunge: Live Market Updates,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin vowed on Friday that the United States government would do whatever was necessary to ensure that markets have Ã¢ÂÂalmost unlimitedÃ¢ÂÂ liquidity.

This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.

(CNN) With Tuesday's announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Pelosi has finally put constitutional duty above perceived political expediency.

House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently slow-played the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding Ukraine scandal

Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's own admissions and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump suspended $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.

Trump and his defenders claim his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump stated Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, ""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it."" But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection? Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries?

Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was ""very friendly."" That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid.

Trump also claims he exerted ""no pressure"" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could.

And Trump claimed, ""NO quid pro quo."" But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the ""this for that"" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own original statement, made clear he equates ""corruption in Ukraine"" with ""investigate Biden"" and little else: ""All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son.""

So, what crimes could Trump be violation of?

Foreign election aid -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to ""solicit, accept or receive"" a ""thing of value"" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged (""solicited"") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.

While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a ""thing of value."" And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a leading contender to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?

Bribery -- it is illegal for a public official ""directly or indirectly"" to demand, seek, receive or accept any ""thing of value"" in return for ""being influenced in the performance of any official act."" Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding ""influence in the performance of an official act"" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself has drawn that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out ""corruption."" Trump has made clear that he equates ""corruption"" with the Biden investigation.

Extortion is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially ""I'll help you, if you help me,"" while extortion is ""I'll harm you, if you don't help me."" The suspension of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.

Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office.

But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.

JUST WATCHED Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rep. Lewis joins Dems calling for impeachment inquiry 01:04

Impeachment need not be based on a crime. The Constitution prescribes impeachment for ""treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be drawn from English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.

The Constitution separates impeachment from criminal prosecution. Draft articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to abuse of power for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine).

This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.

Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi is now changing course on impeachment.

By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

Now, your questions

If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of ""urgent concern"" and (2) ""credible,"" then he or she ""shall submit"" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- reviewed the complaint and found that it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.

But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI concluded that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not ""a member of the Intelligence Community"" and the conduct did not ""involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision."" In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President.

That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.

That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.

Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?

Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution explicitly grants the House the ""sole power of impeachment"" and the Senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments,"" with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.

In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus was impeached and convicted on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.

Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?

As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have openly contemplated utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact, nobody has ever been fined by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama convincingly argues that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.

While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will ""fight all the subpoenas,"" he likely would fight all the fines. Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up.

Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, ""Make me."" Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.

Three questions to watch

1) Will Pelosi finally see the light and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment?

2) Will House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff take the intelligence community whistleblower case to court?",Democrats' only choice is to impeach Trump,"Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday.
Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a ""thing of value"" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine.
By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic.""

Since 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes

Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book ""United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.""

(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.

Because 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.

But Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.

In fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.

In other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.

294,https://us.cnn.com/2015/10/19/politics/planned-parenthood-videos/index.html,"Costa Mesa, California (CNN) David Daleiden wanted to show exactly what a 19-week-old aborted fetus, being held in the hands of a medical technician, looked like. The problem was he didn't have that picture. So he went to the Internet, found something close and inserted it into his documentary.

The photo, two cupped hands holding a tiny male fetus, appeared on screen as dramatic music played. Against this backdrop, a medical technician detailed how she was present when an intact 19-week gestated fetus was aborted at a Planned Parenthood clinic and, she says, harvested for tissue samples.

Daleiden's video failed to mention that the photo and the story do not match.

Abortion photo actually stillborn child

The photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic. It was the stillborn child of Alexis Fretz, whose son was stillborn in 2013. Fretz took the photo and posted it on the Internet to memorialize the son she named Walter.

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

Without Fretz's knowledge, Daleiden and his two-man documentary group called the Center for Medical Progress plucked that photo from her web page and dropped it into his anti-Planned Parenthood documentary.

""Was it clear?"" Fretz asks herself in a CNN interview, ""No it was not clear. Was it deceitful? I don't know that.""

Daleiden told CNN the fact that the photo is not an actual photo of an aborted fetus makes no difference. He insists the fetus is the same age as the one referred to in his film, and he used it only as an illustration.

Misleading video cited in Republican debate

Daleiden also is being criticized for a second, potentially misleading use of video that has found its way into the Republican presidential campaign. GOP candidate Carly Fiorina cited a portion of the Center for Medical Progress videos in which an intact fetus kicks its left leg and moves an arm shortly after being aborted.

Fiorina described the video during CNN's Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential library on September 16, using the horrific image in her call for an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

In an interview in Southern California earlier this month, Daleiden now admits he has no information on where the video was actually taken. There is no evidence it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

Daleiden says the image came from an outside source, an anti-abortion group called the Center For Bioethical Reform and he doesn't know its origin beyond that. A spokesman for the group tells CNN it won't disclose the location either, only that the video in question was paid for. Despite its source, Daleiden again insists the video is only used as an illustration of what an intact aborted fetus would look like, not the actual fetus referred to in his film.

Critics call videos heavily edited, discredited

The two examples of misleading pictures and video have allowed Planned Parenthood and its supporters to label the Center for Medical Progress's entire production a fraud.

Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president with Planned Parenthood, repeated the defense the women's health group and its many supporters have been trying to convey since the first of the Center for Medical Progress's nine videos began to be released online.

""All of the tapes and footage David Daleiden has released out into the world has been heavily edited,"" Laguens told CNN. ""And I think pretty thoroughly discredited.""

Daleiden insists the two uses of video and photos are not misleading, and says the entire controversy has been manufactured by Planned Parenthood and its ""allies in the mainstream media"" in order to divert attention from the main point of his documentary: that Planned Parenthood uses aborted fetal tissue as a revenue source.

Planned Parenthood ends payments

The Center for Medical Progress spent several years taping Planned Parenthood employees, medical directors and some of its affiliate partners discussing the technique, costs and reimbursement payments for the harvesting of fetal tissue samples for scientific research.

The filming was done without knowledge of those speaking. In several instances, CMP argues that Planned Parenthood representatives appear to be bargaining, negotiating and detailing the best ways to collect or ""harvest"" aborted fetuses for maximum financial gain.

In one episode, Dr. Mary Gatter, a medical director for Planed Parenthood, is filmed during a meal discussing her proposal that each tissue sample harvested should fetch a $75 charge.

Since selling fetal tissue samples is illegal, Planned Parenthood has been quick to label the transactions as reimbursement costs and that they were made only at a tiny fraction of the organization's 700 clinics and affiliates. Planned Parenthood executives continue to claim the videos are heavily edited, taken out of context and deceptive.

But last week Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement costs at any of its clinics for the transfer of fetal tissue-samples. In a letter to the National Institutes of Health, Planned Parenthood's president defended her organization and insisted all transactions in the past were legal. But says the new change in policy was being taken ""...in order to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.""

Contacted after the announcement, Daleiden says the sudden change in policy is an admission that he and his videos were right.

""If the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts were truly legitimate 'reimbursement,' why cancel it?"" Daleiden wrote in a statement to CNN. ""This proves what the Center for Medical Progress has been saying all along -- Planned Parenthood incurs no actual costs, and the payments for harvested fetal parts have always been an extra profit margin.""",The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"Abortion photo actually stillborn childThe photo was not an aborted fetus at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

470,https://us.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/musk-vertical-farm/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

Vertical farming is an indoor farming method in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases.

While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk , who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming.

""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email.

Kimbal Musk teaches students how to plant a vegetable garden in California.

""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center.

Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" Ã¢ÂÂ with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale Ã¢ÂÂ in less than three months.

Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries.

The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space.

""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report.

It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.

As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University.

Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.

Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable.

Basil growing at the Square Roots farm in Brooklyn.

""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.

At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly.

Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy.""

Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks.""",Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

I belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over Ã¢ÂÂ the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.

Yet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution.

Paul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever

Sixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , ""The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history.""

Nearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever

Paul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.

In the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)

I'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.

Dasha Burns: Millennials have an existential crisis

Don't hate us -- we're just confused. We've seemingly made "" changing the world "" with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).

Dasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.

But in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.

This is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.

Of course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.

We're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.

So, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.

We're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.

Dasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.

Pepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation

For me, it's a tale of two cities.

One city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.

Pepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.

Most of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.

But there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a ""cocktail,"" general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.

Our generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.

John Sutter: Hmm, identity crisis...

At 33, I'm a young-ish-but-sorta-old person with a generational identify crisis. I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X. I can quote ""Reality Bites,"" a staple of the 30s to 40s set, but I also use Snapchat.

I'm both and neither. Generation-adjacent. Floating in time.

John Sutter's selfie at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2013, after he finished a reporting trip down the San Joaquin River in California.

I think people in my situation -- the youngish-sorta-getting-older set -- define ourselves mostly in terms of what we're not. Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of ""trend piece"" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment. We millennial-adjacents may seem wayward and indecisive -- but we're light years ahead on all those issues.

It's the boomers holding us back. I mean -- it is, right?

Donna Brazile: We got Steve Jobs and Oprah Winfrey

I'm a proud baby boomer. That's my generation, marked by the proliferating of our parents or grandparents after they returned from World War II.

Donna Brazile at the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington in 1983, which she helped organize.

From the beginning of the 1900s to about the mid-'60s, generations had romantic names: the lost generation, the greatest generation, the silent generation, the baby boomers. Then someone hiccuped and historians went generic: gen X, gen Y and gen Z.

If I were a member of generations X, Y or Z, I'd be miffed. Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all ""me, me, me,"" and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.

For all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Ã¢ÂÂ has to be considered the best. But I am sure some of my friends in the millennial generation would likely say the best is yet to come. Go ahead. Prove me wrong.

Paul Callan: Gen Ys and millennials, stop whining

We baby boomers grew up watching small black and white TVs that carried only four networks that went off the air at midnight. Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.

In school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't ""helicopter"" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.

Paul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.

In 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.

At work, there were ""typewriters,"" ""carbon paper"" for making copies and ""white out"" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented. You had to get it right the first time or you would look like an idiot to the judge because of all the white out on your document. Public telephone calls were made from ""phone booths"": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.

Cigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.

People who owned cars put ""No Radio"" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.

In 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting. A serial killer called ""Son of Sam"" was still on the loose that night. But we survived.

We boomers are tough, resilient, hardworking and creative. Instead of whining, we invented rock 'n' roll.

Matthew Segal: What's holding us back?

Debating which generation is better or cooler is a popular but futile exercise. It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.

Matthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.

To a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.

The cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.

Maybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.

Sarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress

The real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.

Millennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.

Sarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.

We are the most diverse generation in American history. We are also incredibly progressive.

We are creative and have used our ideas to make new things. Boomers invented the Internet, generation X improved it, and millennials found how to bring people closer through it. Even though we join all other generations in hating the nonsense that is the U.S. Congress, we remain optimistic that government can be used as a tool to help people, or, if you're a ""Daily Show"" fan, something to laugh at.

Like those who came before us we're neither better nor worse, good nor bad. We're different, and we bring different experiences and understanding to the table. There's no competition. We're in the same boat trying to do what we can with what we've got to make a better world.

Christian Louboutin is CNN Style's new guest editor . He's commissioned a series of stories around the topic of ""Journeys.""

Far from the jewelry workshops of Paris and the showrooms of the world's most rarefied auction houses, a capital of sparkle has developed in the American southwest.

Each winter, some 65,000 visitors descend on Arizona for the Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase to admire and acquire shiny new pieces to brighten up their lives. With thousands of vendors setting up shop and 50 separate shows around the city, it's less an exclusive experience than a cosmic jumble sale where nothing is too large or too ostentatious to catch somebody's eye; and nothing is too unusual to lure in curious passers-by.

While diamonds and precious stones hold a place of honor, there's no shortage of oddities for sale, from animal pelts and skulls to personalized rubber ducks. Over the course of a single day of this year's showcase, which ran from January 30 to February 14, photographer Daniel Arnold saw a $70,000 geode ""the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,"" a baby goat being led around a parking lot by a cowboy, and enough tie-dye to rival a Grateful Dead concert.

""A proper, polished gem show takes over the convention center, and the rest of the city becomes Its swap meet parking lot,"" Arnold said. ""It's an idyllic post-apocalyptic scene, like a very fun version of the end of the world.""

More than 7,300 coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout South Korea, killing more than 50. It is one of the largest outbreaks outside mainland China, where the deadly virus was first identified. However, the number of new daily infections in South Korea has declined in recent days.

Park said that while he believes the aggregate number of infections is high, he is confident in the job South Korea did to combat the virus' spread and would advise other governments who are dealing with outbreaks to focus efforts on early testing and global cooperation.

The South Korean government has been among the most ambitious when it comes to providing the public with free and easy testing options. It has the ability run about 15,000 diagnostic test per day and has conducted 196,000 tests to date nationwide, free of charge. Authorities in the city of Goyang even set up drive-thru testing booths.

He's pleased that his protege and close friend Adam Silver, the current NBA commissioner, on Wednesday night showed the world what bold, intelligent leadership looks like when he announced the league would suspend the NBA season, after one and then two players -- Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz and later teammate Donovan Mitchel l -- said they tested positive for the coronavirus.

After the players' diagnosis, Silver didn't hesitate to make the right call for the NBA, and the right call for America. For me, Silver's decision is a sobering but inspiring reminder that true commitment to social responsibility means that capitalism doesn't always have to mean profits over people.

Within hours of the NBA's decision, other sports leagues followed suit . Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League all took action. MLB called off spring training and delayed its season, MLS suspended play for 30 days, and the NHL suspended its season. The NBA announcement caught many in the sports world by surprise, including a few NBA players -- among them Lakers star LeBron James, who tweeted

""Man we cancelling sporting events, school, office work, etc etc. What we really need to cancel is 2020! Damn it's been a rough 3 months. God bless and stay safe""

But shocking or not, the NBA Ã¢ÂÂ where the average team is valued at more than $2 billion Ã¢ÂÂ showed America a commanding leadership that sadly has been absent as we watch our President Donald Trump, pundits and politicians (on both sides of the aisle) send citizens dangerously confusing messages about the virus and how we can protect ourselves.

Under Commissioner Stern, the league was never afraid to confront important social issues , especially about inequality and injustice in America. Long before it was trendy, Stern initiated a nearly two-month long campaign that included television segments, short Black History Month specials, school and community events with NBA players to celebrate the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr. And that leadership continued under Silver, who has been vocal on LGBTQ issues, going as far as moving the 2017 NBA All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina , after that state's opposition over the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" -- a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people that was widely criticized as discriminatory.

And in stark contrast to the NFL and how it handled Colin Kaepernick's police brutality protests, Commissioner Silver offered unconditional support to NBA players who protested and spoke out against the police killings of unarmed black men and women along with the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

""Part of the reason NBA players are more active is that it's been part of the culture of this league for generations and passed down to them,"" Silver told CNN in 2018.

It was disappointing, but not surprising , that the often-maligned National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hesitated to suspend the college basketball season. But you see, it's March Madness Tournament time in college. And March Madness is a cash cow for just about everyone associated with college sports, except the players, who get paid zilch.

There's no doubt the NCAA Ã¢ÂÂ with more than 1,200 member schools that have student populations that range from the hundreds to the tens of thousands Ã¢ÂÂ is responsible for a much larger population than the NBA (30 teams with 15 to 20 players). But for me, that doesn't preclude the organization from taking a clear leadership role to try to protect its players in the best possible way from the coronavirus health crisis. And ultimately agreeing to cancel March Madness and other winter and spring sports is a good decision.

While athletes are paid nothing, in 2019 alone, the NCAA earned $933 million from media rights fees, ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and advertising sales around the three-week-long tournament.

JUST WATCHED What's life in a locked-down Milan like as a sports journalist? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What's life in a locked-down Milan like as a sports journalist? 03:44

Off the court, fans filled out tournament brackets and wagered $8.5 billion on March Madness.

The highly watched March Madness games are a boon for television networks, who all compete for broadcasting rights. In 2016, CBS and Turner Sports paid the NCAA an additional $8.8 billion to extend their March Madness rights through 2032. Their original deal, from 2011-2024, had cost over $10.8 billion. (Turner Sports is owned by CNN's parent company.)

Initially on Wednesday, the organization announced an eyebrow-raising plan to confront the pandemic health crisis. It said the tournament would go on as scheduled, but fans would not be allowed to attend the games. Instead, the games would go on with select family members, staff and game officials allowed in the arena. To many observers, it was as if NCAA officials hadn't been paying full attention at all to the warnings and safety measures put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I mean exactly what did the NCAA envision happening? Players would use a Clorox wipe to disinfect the ball every time it was passed to them? Or, that no one would touch their face to swipe sweat from their eyes? Good grief. Anyone who's ever bounced a basketball will tell you that's impossible.

But unlike professional sports leagues, where highly paid athletes are protected by players unions and sports agents, especially when issues of player safety are concerned, college athletes must do as the NCAA demands.

So most sports fans know to give the side-eye to any and all NCAA decisions, when it comes to issues of player safety and profits. And sadly, the NCAA's stumbling toward a decision to cancel March Madness on Thursday only served as a reminder that the organization cannot be trusted to protect players.

Regardless of what many fans believe, student-athlete life is not easy. It's often not even fun -- the missed holidays and summer vacations with friends and family, the nearly impossible demands of trying to keep grades up while spending most of your days in the gym, or on the road going to games. It's exhausting.

No doubt, millions of college athletes are disappointed by the way the season has ended -- in basketball and many other spring sports now being canceled as campuses close or move instruction online. I know many are crushed that all their sacrifices to play sports have come to this sad ending and I am sad for them. It feels incredibly unfair. We teach our kids about self-sacrifice and being good citizens, but it's a bitter pill to swallow when we are called upon to make those sacrifices in such stark terms as the ones unfolding right now.

March Madness is my favorite time of year. Call me sappy but the tournaments remind me of the power of the human spirit to rise to our greatest challenges. We dream of Cinderella teams winning out over big-moneyed programs. We look for David and Goliath epic battles and stories of redemption. Watching March Madness makes me feel like a kid again.

Sports has been my sanctuary. The place I go to forget my worries and beat back my fears for a few hours. As a student-athlete, a fan, and later a sports journalist, I have had sports as my constant joy. But today, it feels like there is no sanctuary from the chaos. We awake each day to renewed fears of the coronavirus and toxic political talk.

1200,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676,"Image copyright La Voix du Nord Image caption Toilet queues spurred Nathalie Des Isnards to start her company making women's urinals

A few years ago, Nathalie Des Isnards was attending a music festival with her husband David, and planning to watch her favourite group.

Before the show, they headed to the toilets. ""I spent 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pee,"" she recalls. Much to her frustration, she missed the first part of the concert.

Meanwhile David took just ""two minutes"", and saw the whole show.

""I was upset. I told myself, 'We're in the 21st century, something should be done about that.'""

She set about creating a women's urinal. The simple seatless basin she devised is housed in a cubicle with roof and door, designed for faster use but also privacy. ""I was not a designer. I was a user first,"" says the 46-year-old.

Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

However, thanks to social media, and growing competition between event organisers, she thinks the issue is getting more attention.

""[It] forces them to offer better services,"" she explains. Also, organisers now realise, when women are queuing, they're not spending money.

Des Isnards says 100,000 women used madamePee last year, at 15 events across France, including the Women's World Cup. ""It fits all women, not only young ones open to innovation.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption MadamePee hopes women's urinals will lead to shorter queues at events such as festivals and marathons

Two units have been also been installed in Paris as public amenities, she says. This year the loo will be in several other countries.

""The ambition is very clear. It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,"" says the French entrepreneur.

Even newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.

Copenhagen-based architects, Gina PÃÂ©rier and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.

""It's just insanely more efficient,"" says Ms PÃÂ©rier, 25.

The idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival. ""I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,"" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. ""There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.""

Image copyright Eric Delafosse Image caption Lapee is 'insanely more efficient' say its creators

According to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate.

The team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.

Getting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. ""We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,"" she tells me.

Lapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.

Ms PÃÂ©rier says Lapee is also targeting, ""public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.""

The start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year.

They're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.

More Technology of Business

Other urinal products have launched with varying success.

Perhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up.

Sam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.

""The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,"" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further.

Mr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.

Gail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.

""It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,"" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.

""Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption Research suggests women take up to twice as long to use toilets

Women typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned.

""We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,"" Ms Ramster says.

""Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.""

Researchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times.

But the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women.

""For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,"" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. ""This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].""

It could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them.",Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

418,https://us.cnn.com/style/article/malaysia-1mdb-najib-zunar-fahmi-reza-intl/index.html,"Zunar and Fahmi Reza's art was a boon to protesters sick of the alleged corruption of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it nearly landed the two men in prison.

Also instantly recognizable is the artist behind the picture, which has pride of place at an exhibition in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur. Political cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Haque, better known as Zunar, has spent most of the last decade lampooning Najib and Rosmah, even as the risks for doing so grow ever greater.

Zunar's work welcomes visitors to ""Democracy in Action,"" a recent exhibition that would have been impossible to stage only a year ago. In one cartoon, a hand holding chopsticks marked ""China"" reaches over to pluck Malaysia off a platter marked ""1MDB scandal."" In another, a huge diamond ring, a handbag and a bag of cash come together, Transformers-style, to form an image of Rosmah.

At the center sits Zunar's motto: ""How can I be neutral ... even my pen has a stand.""











1 / 6 Zunar has faced considerable restrictions on his work in the past. Credit: Zunar

That motto has been severely tested in recent times. Just last year, it seemed almost certain that Zunar would end up in prison. A number of his books had been banned, and while his work was still widely shared online, the artist faced multiple charges of sedition and committing acts deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy."" Unknown assailants attacked him at a gallery show, police seized his works and he was banned from leaving the country.

Then, in a shock election result, a coalition of opposition parties turfed Najib out of office, promising to clamp down on corruption and reverse the country's turn toward authoritarianism.

Now Zunar is watching as his the political figures who were once his nemeses and muses face decades behind bars themselves -- in part because artists like him helped bring attention to their alleged corruption and disdain for the rule of law.

Zunar tells CNN that it's his mission to save Malaysia. Credit: James Griffiths/CNN

""The medium of cartooning is (a) very powerful medium,"" Zunar told CNN at his small studio in a Kuala Lumpur suburb. ""Everywhere, in any country you go, (cartoonists) get killed. Cartoonists, get arrested, put in jail everywhere because of the medium.""

Fellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.

""Using satire and humor is effective because it breaks the fear barrier,"" he said in a phone interview.

""People had always been afraid to speak out. The culture of fear is always there; the culture of self-censorship is always there. That's where satire and humor can be the most effective tool, it makes people less afraid.""

Cartoonist's muse

After a number of false starts, Zunar's career as a political cartoonist was flagging when his nemesis emerged on the political scene in the 1990s.

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Najoib's wife Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Credit: Zunar

In many ways, the artist's career trajectory rose in tandem with that of Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers who climbed quickly through the ranks of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, initially as deputy prime minister and then to the premiership itself in 2009.

As Najib's star grew, so did the frustration of his critics. Detractors delighted in seeing him brought back down to Earth by Zunar's increasingly exaggerated, grotesque portrayals.

More even than Najib however, Zunar found his muse in Rosmah. He did, however, face more difficulty publishing cartoons of her, versus those of the Prime Minister.

""When my book came out with Najib on the cover, I could at least release it,"" Zunar said. When Rosmah was the subject however, ""the police came and stopped the launch ... (from this) we can understand that maybe that she is more powerful.""

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When police raided the couple's properties in Kuala Lumpur last year, they seized jewelry and gemstones worth over $109 million. Around $13 million worth of HermÃÂ¨s handbags were also confiscated, along with cash and other goods totaling over $100 million.

Many of the items were, allegedly, purchased with money embezzled from the 1MDB state investment fund, set up by Najib. Rosmah has pleaded not guilty, and due to numerous delays in the legal system, has yet to end up in court.

The 1MDB scandal -- and Rosmah's spending -- became a central theme of Zunar's work. In particular, the artist sought to make a connection between the allegedly embezzled funds and the Malaysian people: One cartoon showed Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal's waste.

""Zunar has such a finely developed sense of what is right and what is fair,"" said Robert Russell, executive director of the Cartoonists Rights Network International. ""Like any good political cartoonist he has this well-developed sense of righteous indignation.""

Russell said Zunar's cartoons were so effective, in part, because they undercut concerted efforts by the government to present itself, particularly overseas, as a legitimate and clean administration. Using a combination of journalism and art, Zunar highlighted the instances where this was not the case.

But doing so would ultimately endanger his freedom, as Najib's government took a hard authoritarian turn in an attempt to stifle criticism.

Clowning around

Beginning in 2010, Zunar was questioned multiple times under the Sedition Act , a colonial-era law widely denounced by human rights groups as draconian.

In 2016, he was charged with taking actions deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy"" over a series of cartoons depicting government corruption. Police seized hundreds of his books, and unknown assailants attacked him at an exhibition.

Later that year, Zunar was slapped with a travel ban after he visited Geneva to accept the Cartooning for Peace Award. The ban, according to free-speech group IFEX, ""appear(ed) to be an attempt to damp down the growing international publicity (surrounding) Zunar and his work.""

Zunar was not the only artist to face blowback for satirizing Najib. In June 2016, Fahmi Reza was charged with two counts of violating section 233(1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, which forbids disseminating online content deemed to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass others.

Fahmi had depicted Najib as a clown with big red lips and arched, thick eyebrows. The image quickly caught on with Malaysians sick of the widespread allegations of corruption, and it soon became a common sight at anti-government protests.

Like Zunar, Fahmi had a record of trouble with the authorities. In 2004 , he designed a poster for a demonstration against police brutality, and volunteered to help print and distribute leaflets and other materials.

Unfortunately for him, Fahmi's conscientiousness was his downfall. Arriving ahead of most other protesters, police saw him with a large number of posters and banners. He was quickly arrested.

""I panicked and I was afraid,"" Fahmi told CNN. ""But I think surviving that made me bolder, knowing that the poster I made was having an effect on these people who abused their power.""

When he was arrested again in 2016, Fahmi was ""fully prepared,"" he said.

""One sign that whatever you're doing is effective is when the authorities and people in power react,"" he added. ""If they ignore it, then there's no impact. That's how the whole clown thing became a symbol of protest -- because of the overreaction by the authorities.""

Satire as a weapon

Both cartoonists' arrests made international headlines, helping to highlight Najib's growing authoritarianism to the outside world. Protesters also delighted in using the caricatures of Najib and Rosmah on posters and placards after it was revealed how much the artists had irritated them.

As Malaysia's opposition grew ever more determined to oust Najib -- with many observers warning that 2016's general election might be their last chance to do so -- the government passed new legislation to control what people could say about it.

In early 2018, it introduced a new law to crack down on ""fake news"" that critics said was so broadly defined that it could easily be used to shut down and criminalize criticism of Najib.

Eventually however, the wave of dissent was too great for Najib to overcome. Even though the electoral map was redrawn in his favor, he lost heavily. With an 82.32% turnout, an opposition coalition led by current Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad took 121 of 222 seats. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition won just 79.

Uncertain future

Since Najib's downfall, charges against Zunar and Fahmi have been dropped, though the latter is still fighting to have an earlier conviction overturned.

Both men said that, while they felt considerably freer under the new government, true reform has yet to be delivered.

""(The government is) more tolerant toward online dissent and criticism -- and even insults,"" Fahmi said, despite the fact that the ""online content"" law used to prosecute him is still on the books.

""People know it's still there, so I think some people are still afraid to voice their criticism openly,"" Fahmi said.

Zunar said the new government's most important task is to ""repair the damage"" done by previous regimes. He is willing to give them time to do so, but as for the future, ""we don't know yet.""

Russell, of Cartoonists Rights Network International, said Zunar faces a situation similar to that of other dissident cartoonists when their former oppressors leave office.

In the last year of Najib's rule, Zunar was banned from leaving the country. Credit: Zunar

""Even with Zunar's heroes ... now in a new government, he's going to start drawing the same cartoons about them,"" he said. ""This is not necessarily a happy ending. If Zunar is true to his roots, he will be as ruthless with the new government as any (other) government.

In the short term, Zunar is facing a more pressing concern: the loss of his muse, Rosmah.

While she has largely disappeared from Malaysia's political scene while her husband attempts to reinvent himself as a man-of-the-people government critic, the former prime minister's wife remains present inside Zunar's studio, her cartoon face staring up from numerous books and picture frames.

""I miss Rosmah,"" the artist said. ""For me, she was a god send. Very easy to draw, very cartoonable. Her character is very cartoonable.

""As a cartoonist, I miss her. When Trump goes one day, American cartoonists will miss him too.""",Zunar and Fahmi Reza: the cartoonists who helped take down Najib Razak,"Zunar and Fahmi Reza's art was a boon to protesters sick of the alleged corruption of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it nearly landed the two men in prison.
Fellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.

(CNN) To date, over 125,000 cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported worldwide -- with more than 4,000 fatalities. Over 1,400 cases have been reported in the US alone, a number that will surely grow in the coming weeks. Miraculously, though, our country's prisons and jails, many of them unsanitary environments, have yet to experience an outbreak.

But that will likely change, and soon. ""We know that at some point we're going to have a case,"" said Patty Hayes , director of public health for Seattle and King County, Washington, this week, referring to a potential coronavirus case in local jails.

It isn't a matter of if, but when. And when the inevitable takes place, it could have a deadly impact.

Of the 2.3 million incarcerated people in the US, roughly 165,000 are over the age of 55. And compared to the general population, people in jail and prison are more likely to have preexisting health conditions such as high blood pressure, asthma, cancer, arthritis and infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C and HIV. We're still learning about the coronavirus, but what we do know so far is that these two populations are most at risk of falling ill or dying from it.

If ever there was a time for our elected leaders to stand up for people behind bars, it's now.

(CNN) In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.

This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.

And a third party that makes it its raison d'etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.

Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up -- and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we're usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren't good enough.

The immigration disconnect

Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders --that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.

As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.

Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted : ""Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it's time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.""

What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters -- or who had read recent polls -- was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.

According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.

But this was a Democratic primary -- the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?

No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn't. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.

Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.

What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?

The politics of extremes

This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.

On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.

Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in ""the Squad"" -- Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley -- get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.

A so-called "" alterna-squad ,"" a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I've heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, ""Well I can't vote for Trump, but I'm not with those guys, either.""

In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that ""finding common ground"" is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence ""a decent guy."")

Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most ""divisive.""

The silent middle majority

Take abortion. ""[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,"" according to Pew . Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us -- the majority -- agree it should be legal but with restrictions.

Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.

A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn't those voters feel betrayed by that?

Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties' willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.

While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don't , what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.

Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally -- a path to legal status -- if they meet some requirements over time.

And as it turns out, that's what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we're to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.

So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?

Legislative solutions aren't profitable

Here's the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn't as politically profitable as keeping them broken.

Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.

Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.

JUST WATCHED Avlon: Our polarized Congress can't address problems Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Avlon: Our polarized Congress can't address problems 03:10

As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to ""own the Libs,"" and Democratic voters are happy being ""the resistance,"" it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.

Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.

Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.

All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That's likely only going to get worse.

A party by the middle and for the middle

A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn't be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn't take this position or that one, and it wouldn't have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.

For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican -- a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew , a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.

That third party would also lean pro-abortion -- keeping Roe v. Wade in place -- but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.

It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn't, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.

It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.

In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn't on either extreme. There wouldn't be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn't have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.

One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can't, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.

Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.

There's also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.

So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.

Finally, whether an alternative party in today's age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn't swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn't designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one's blood pressure almost instantly.

Because let's face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America's future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we'll all be politically homeless eventually.",SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of "" SE Cupp Unfiltered .""

502,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/10/europe/italy-coronavirus-beniamino-pagliaro-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The whole of Italy has been put on lockdown , as the government desperately tries to gain control of the coronavirus spread.

On Tuesday, thriving cities like Rome, Milan and Venice became ghost towns . Italians are facing a new reality of life with a curfew, travel restrictions and enforced space between people in public places, as the country reports more than 9,000 infections and more than 630 deaths.

CNN spoke to Beniamino Pagliaro , a journalist for national newspaper la Repubblica, who described the measures as unprecedented.

What are you seeing on the streets?

I'm in Rome, and the streets are basically empty. Rome is pretty famous for traffic jams, but there are none at the moment, there is very little traffic.

Like in many offices, most people (at Repubblica) are working from home. Many of our colleagues have children and schools are closed. People were told to work from home for health reasons first, but there just isn't anywhere for children to go.

I live in the Trastevere, and there is a joke about the area, that one in two people are tourists. On a normal day, you can hear lots of people talking in English or Russian. These days, you don't see tourists at all.

In the past week, I've been to Milan, and also there you can feel the city is half-closed. Restaurants are empty.

But don't get me wrong, I think the government was right to choose these rules.

Journalist Beniamino Pagliaro warns other countries may face a similar situation to Italy's soon.

How are people responding to the measures?

They are listening. If you watch how less crowded the cities are, you can tell that something has changed,

Most people are trying to cancel travel. Many friends are canceling trips back to their families' homes. Some friends of mine who live in Rome or Milan, they often go home to stay with family, but their parents are older, so they're canceling because the risk is higher for older people.

People are communicating a lot on social media, sharing what TV shows they're watching, what books they're reading.

People are mostly staying at home with their children. They can go for a run outside while gyms are closed, and some people are meeting in small groups.

I'm not proud to say this, but when (Prime Minister) Conte announced the new measures -- the lockdown of the entire country, bringing the whole country to the same level as Lombardy -- at that moment, some people panicked and there were hundreds of people running to supermarkets in the night to buy things. I'm afraid we are still very irrational in these kind of things.

But this happens in London, Berlin and New York, it's not just Italians.

What is it like looking from the inside to the outer world?

This is a really tough situation. I wrote a story this morning about how it's very worrying and scary to me, that most capitals around the world seem not to have understood how deep a change we need.

Reading news of the UK and United States, what they are doing is what we were doing two weeks ago. The pattern is very, very clear, like you are in denial because you think you can act in another way, but then facts and scientists tell us the only way is to slow down -- you cant stop it -- but slowing down the virus will mean a lot less problems in your hospitals.

In Italy, we were lucky to experience the outbreak in an area with plenty of hospitals like Milan, because if you had this spread of the virus in southern Italy, for example, it really could be a mess.

I know that some parts of the UK and some parts of the US especially are not very well-equipped. In the US, there's also a known situation about healthcare costs.

How do you describe this moment?

So it's a tough moment but also it may force everyone to do the right thing.

Of course, it could be boring to postpone events or travel, but then the good thing in this spread of the virus is that people will understand that we are used to thinking about ourselves. While this spread is happening, it's very clear we are not alone, and so you have to think about the whole of society.

If you put together all the populist movements in the recent years, it was all about ""me wanting this"" and ""me wanting that."" British people who want to be isolated, or to remain -- this makes very clear that the world we live in, we cannot just count just on ourselves, we are together.

THE GREAT OUTDOORS

Though Japan might be most famous for its dazzlingly modern cities, you'll want to spend at least a few days exploring its stunning natural offerings. This is a nation that truly has it all, from rocky mountain peaks to white-sand beaches.

Here are few Japan experiences that will allow for both relaxation and adventure.

Winter sports

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

Nagano, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998, has long been a snowy escape for global travelers. But in recent years, Niseko on the northern island of Hokkaido has become another leading destination for powder hunters thanks to its fresh, quality snow and amazing food scene.

Down on the island of Honshu, meanwhile, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture offers skiing, onsen (more on that later) and ""snow monsters.""

For something completely different, the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route , dubbed the ""Roof of Japan,"" offers travelers a chance to drive down a highway framed by massive walls of snow that tower as high as 17 meters over the road.

Beach hopping

It's easy to see why this stunning Iwate prefecture beach was named ""Jodogahama,"" or Pure Land. JNTO

Being an island nation, Japan's beach offerings are just as impressive as its skyscrapers and bullet trains.

In the north of Japan's main island, Jodogahama Beach (Pure Land in English) is a tranquil hidden beach with crystal-clear water and stark white rocks.

If you prefer softer (and darker) sand, Ibusuki Beach is your dream destination. The subtropical beach is famed for a unique activity -- sand bathing, or suna-mushi.

For island hoppers, you can check out a series of 260 tiny pine tree-covered islands in Matsushima.

Onsen soaking

For anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm. It's the rule.

The word ""onsen"" refers to Japan's natural hot springs but it also can represent facilities like spas and inns that pipe the waters into their own bathing areas.

Though thousands of onsen exist throughout the country, Beppu is Japan's hot spring capital -- and for good reason. It's home to more than 2,500 hot springs and is the world's second-largest source of thermal spring water.

For travelers with ink, however, stripping down at a Japanese onsen can get tricky as many ban tattoos, which have been associated with yakuza gangs.

Fortunately, there's Tattoo-Friendly , a website featuring properties that allow ink. Users can narrow down the search by choosing the type of facility they want to visit -- gym, pool, hotel-and-ryokan (inn) or sento (public baths).

Each listed property includes a brief description of the place and its amenities, as well its specific policies on tattoos.

Hanami

For just a few weeks every spring, Japan celebrates an annual ritual known as hanami: stopping to view and appreciate the beautiful spring blossoms.

It's so popular the Japan Weather Association's annual sakura (cherry blossom) forecast is broadcast live on TV, while the Japan National Tourism Organization has a regularly updated timetable of cherry blossoms predictions on their website.

Hiking

Being a mountainous nation, trekking is an extremely popular Japan activity.

For a spiritual journey, try Kumano Kodo , a multiday pilgrimage across Wakayama prefecture -- fueled by great food, cute rural villages and rich culture along the way.

More than a thousand years ago, imperial leaders and aristocrats made their way to the main Kumano Kodo shrines through a network of hikes across the island. At the end of the hike we recommend spending the night at a temple in the mountaintop town of Koyasan , the center of Shingon Buddhism.

Here, ancient cedar forests share space with historic pagodas, paved roads, restaurants, schools, cafes and souvenir shops.

The enchanting Yakushima forest (the setting for Hayao Miyazaki's epic film Princess Mononoke) on Kyushu island and the Sagano bamboo forest on the outskirts of Kyoto are other family-friendly places to enjoy a quiet walk in Japan.

TRADITION

Japan excels at striking the right balance between tradition and modernity, leading the way in technological advances while also embracing its past, whether it's architecture, art, fashion, food or sports.

Here are a few experiences that will give you a taste for Japan's traditional side.

Stay in a ryokan

Looking for that classic Japanese inn experience, complete with tatami floors, onsen and sliding doors?

Staying in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese guesthouse, is the way to go. Catering to all budgets, they can be found throughout Japan -- most commonly in the countryside outside of urban centers.

Guests are encouraged to wear yukata (house kimonos) and socks, while traditional Japanese meals are prepared in-house.

Tea ceremonies

CNN's Paula Newton travels to Fukuoka and the surrounding tea-rich lands to experience the traditional winter tea ceremony.

The Japanese tea ceremony, or chado , is a traditional way of preparing and serving matcha (top quality green tea).

To make it, green tea leaves, grown in the shade, are dried and ground into a fine powder. This allows the tea to retain its nutrients. During the ceremony, which focuses on the rituals and mental states achieved in the process, the powder is whisked with hot water in a small bowl until a slight foam appears.

The top place to experience Japan's matcha tea ceremony -- or just enjoy a few cups of the precious drink -- is Kyoto. There are plenty of tea making classes and demonstrations available in English and other languages.

Kimonos

Japan's most beautiful traditional attire, kimonos are undeniably an expensive souvenir to bring home. One reason for their hefty price tag is the painstakingly detailed process that goes into making them.

Another reputable kimono-making company is Okaju in Kyoto, founded in 1855 and now helmed by the fourth generation Shigeo Okajima.

If you'd simply like to don one during your Japan visit, there are a number of rental companies throughout Kyoto.

Prefer to appreciate these beautiful garments from afar? Kyoto's Gion district is where travelers can view graceful geishas, traditional Japanese entertainers, walking down the street in their kimonos.

Sumo watching

Sumo is as ancient as it is quintessentially Japanese. Historians agree that the sport dates back at least 2,000 years, and in its current form has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period.

But scoring a seat at one of Japan's six major sumo tournaments per year might as tough as getting into the ring and wrestling yourself, though with a little advance planning you can make it happen. Tickets are available through Japan's official sumo website

There are other ways to get close to a sumo wrestler.

When they're not competing, sumo wrestlers train year round in designated sumo stables, or beya.

These stables, which are mostly based in Tokyo's Ryogoku neighborhood, are where the city's wrestlers live, eat, sleep and practice on a near daily basis. In recent years, it's become more common for foreigners to visit the morning practice, which begins at about 5 a.m. and lasts three to four hours.

CUISINE

Japan is a culinary wonderland thanks to its unique heritage, a national obsession with food and an almost religious embrace of freshness and perfect production.

Here are a few of the country's must-try dining experiences. Been there, ate that? For a deeper dive into the country's culinary wonders, check out our list of 25 top Japanese dishes

Sushi

l e v a r t

Chances are, sushi is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think ""Japanese food.""

More than just a slice of fish over vinegar rice -- that is only one type, called nigiri -- mastering the art of sushi can easily take a lifetime. Luckily, there's Sushi University , where travelers can learn to distinguish nigiri from nori-maki.

Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.

Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.

If you're up for a splurge, Sushisho Masa (106-0031 Tokyo, Minato City,Nishiazabu, 4 ChomeÃ¢ÂÂ1Ã¢ÂÂ15) in Tokyo's Roppongi neighborhood is nothing short of perfection.

And then of course there's Sukiyabashi Jiro , the fabled restaurant in Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world. Hidden in a basement attached to the Ginza Metro Station, Sukiyabashi Jiro earned global fame following the 2012 documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi.""

Kobe beef

Only 3,000 cattle are classified as Kobe grade each year. ÃÂ©JNTO

Known for its pervasive marbling and melt-on-your-tongue texture, Kobe beef is one of Japan's most prized meats.

A type of Wagyu beef named after the region in which the cattle are raised, Kobe is relatively rare -- only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade.

This has caused a fair bit of confusion but here's an easy way to remember it. Wagyu (which literally means ""Japanese cow"") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline.

The Kansai region, where Osaka is based, produces the three ""king"" varieties of Wagyu: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty.

Soba

Want a seat at Kyourakutei? You'll have to wait in line. CNN meets up with the man behind this popular Michelin-starred Tokyo soba restaurant.

Soba, or Japanese buckwheat noodles, are usually served cold with dipping sauce (called zaru soba) or served hot in dashi broth.

Triumphing over them all is te-uchi, which means ""handmade,"" soba in Japanese. The hand-kneaded and cut soba offers the best firmness and, hence, is more much tastier than the mass-produced variety.

For a truly unique soba experience, head to Iwate, a prefecture in Japan's northeast where you can enjoy a 400-year-old all-you-can-eat noodle tradition called "" wanko soba .""

One wanko soba restaurant claims a diner ate 570 bowls in one sitting.

Yakitori

One of the best reasons to visit a pub in Japan? Yakitori, Japanese style chicken skewers. ÃÂ©JNTO

A yakitori restaurant is where you can sample every part of the chicken -- from chicken breast to skins to gizzards -- all presented on skewers, Japanese style.

Tokyo's Torikado is one of the best places to enjoy them. A high-end omakase yakitori restaurant, Torikado's diners will leave it up to the chef to decide what they eat.

Another popular way to chow down a few chicken skewers is with a beer at an izakaya, or casual Japanese pub. Here's our selection of the best (and affordable) izakaya in Tokyo

Kaiseki

Kaiseki meals were originally intended to be enjoyed before a tea ceremony.

Japan travelers researching a trip to Kyoto will inevitably come across the word ""kaiseki.""

To the outsider, it appears to simply be a multicourse Japanese dinner made up of beautifully plated dishes. But there's so much more to this meticulously prepared, exquisitely served and, usually, very expensive meal.

To practitioners of this haute cuisine, kaiseki is the embodiment of ""omotenashi,"" which means wholehearted hospitality.

Ramen

Ramen is the ultimate Japanese comfort food. ÃÂ©Hiroshima Prefecture/ÃÂ©JNTO

Nothing's more comforting than slurping back a bowl of ramen on a cold rainy day.

There are four basic styles of the world-famous soup-based dish: Shoyu (soy sauce seasoning); shio (a light soy sauce version of shoryu); miso (made with fermented soy beans); and tonkotsu (a creamy-white pork bone broth).

CNN Travel asked Brian Mac, founder of the blog Ramen Adventures , to share some of his favorite ramen varieties in Tokyo and beyond, which include Hokkaido's miso ramen, Kyushu's Kumamoto ramen and all kinds of shoyu variations. Read more about them here

Sake

A one-minute tour of Japan's northern Tohoku region, which produces some of the country's best bottles of sake.

Japanese rice wine, sake has a long-standing history dating back to the third century.

It's produced all over the country -- and many brewers are open to tours -- but Japan's Tohoku region in the northeast is where you'll find some of the best bottles.

Part of what makes Tohoku's sakes so different is geography: The winters are severe with heavy snowfalls and historically, because of its remoteness, agriculture has been the mainstay in Tohoku.

For visitors making the trip north, several breweries offer tours in English, as well as tastings -- but you will need to book in advance via their websites.",16 Japan experiences every traveler needs to enjoy,"Koichi Kamoshida/Getty ImagesFor anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm.

91,https://us.cnn.com/2020/01/06/opinions/india-citizenship-amendment-tewari/index.html,"Manish Tewari is a Member of Parliament representing Shri Anandpur Sahib Lok Sabha Constituency. He is a ranking member of the opposition party, the Indian National Congress and was a former Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) India witnessed one of the most melancholy moments in its recent past when the eminent historian Ramachandra Guha was dragged away by the Bengaluru police during the anti Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

His apparent offense? Participating in the right of dissent that is the holy grail of any constitutional democracy. Guha and others have rightfully taken a stand against the Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by the upper and lower houses of India's Parliament, which is vague and unconstitutional because it makes fast-tracked citizenship dependent on one's religion.

Watching Ramachandra Guha being taken away reminded me of his riveting exposition on why India is the most fascinating country in the world. The central thesis being how India had emerged as a religiously pluralistic society when most nations have defined themselves through a monotheist lens.

Indeed, India can be said to be a utopia that defines itself by the phrase ""unity in diversity."" I wrote in an earlier op-ed that ""out of a bloodstained Partition there emerged two ideas of nationhood -- a progressive, pluralistic and inclusive impulse that became the idea of the Republic of India and a theocratic template that became the idea of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."" Sadly the events playing out through the actions of the government depict a trajectory that is distinct from the vision of a pluralistic society.

India has been the birthplace of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, which add to its cultural smorgasbord. Even the Abrahamic religions have a unique history in India. Syriac Christians in India emerged shortly after Christ died and 600 years before Islam came into being. History records that Thomas the first, one of Jesus' 12 apostles, landed in Kerala to spread Christianity and today, he is buried in Tamil Nadu. The country today is host to a significant population of the Christian faith.

Islam came peacefully to the south and has a slightly more complicated history up north. Today, India has the second largest Muslim population in the world, despite not being an Islamic country. India is one of the few countries which houses members of the Jewish diaspora who have never faced any form of state-led persecution.

More interesting is the story of the Parsi community and their arrival in India. While fleeing religious persecution in Persia, they docked on Indian shores, in modern day Gujarat. Apocryphal tales have it that the King Jadhav Rana sent a bowl of milk filled to the brim, implying that he would not be able to accommodate them. The Parsis returned the same bowl of milk with sugar in it to convey that, just as the sugar had seamlessly mixed with the milk, they too would integrate effortlessly.

For centuries, India has assimilated, internalized, accommodated and embraced waves of immigrants, invaders, traders and preachers among others. The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 (CAB), coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) -- a register of all Indian citizens whose creation is mandated by the citizenship act of 1955, subsequently amended in 2003 -- is an assault on India's pluralistic ethos. It is an affront to the first principles of constitutionalism. It violates Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 25 and 26 and the basic structure doctrine now cast in stone in the 1973 Indian Supreme Court case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, which, by a slender majority, mandated that certain articles that form the core of the Constitution are beyond even the amending powers of Parliament.

In a secular nation like India, religion cannot be the basis of citizenship, whether territorial or extra-territorial. It also militates against the first principle of reasonable classification under Article 14 -- equals cannot be treated as unequals. You cannot make religion the determinant for granting refuge, asylum or citizenship.

The act seems to be testing the waters for a pan-India NRC that would make the citizenship of billions subject to the whimsical biases and ideological predilections of those in government today in New Delhi. Moreover, the Citizenship Amendment Act adopts different benchmarks for Bangladesh and Bhutan. The government's defense is that it is meant to protect persecuted minorities in its pan-Islamic neighborhood, specifically, non-Muslim minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

However, Maldives too is Islamic as per Article 10 of its Constitution. Yet, the bill does not extend the same privileges to minorities in the island nation as it does to those of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country, where the Tamil minority (largely Hindu) have long faced persecution at the hands of pro-Sinhalese nationalists. Why does the act exclude them then? What about Ahmadis, Shias, and Baloch in Pakistan? Yes, they're Muslim, but they have been under the shoe of Sunni hardliners, and hardships have been further exacerbated by the military establishment and the constitution in Pakistan that refuses to recognize Ahmadis as Muslims. There is also the case of persecuted Christians in Bhutan.

What would have been more magnanimous on the part of the government would have been comprehensive legislation that is holistic and welcomes all individuals fleeing persecution and not drawing arbitrary lines to gauge persecution based on religious denominations.

There are many shades of grey here and hence we need nuances separating illegal migrants from refugees and granting citizenship on a case-by-case basis in a non-discriminatory manner.

India is in uproar, in protest, in ennui, in disenfranchisement, in pain, in anger, in suffering. If this government cares about its image globally, then it knows that at this rate, it is in trouble. Good governments listen to the pulse of the nation and can diagnose pain points expeditiously. It's one thing for this government to have won an election decisively but today it's ability to govern is seriously in question.

India has stood the test of democracy, when all others around it became tin pot dictatorships run by the military. When imperialism and colonialism retreated across the world, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America, India was one nation that did not go under either totalitarian or one party rule, and never, ever under a military jackboot.

Aside from critically ill patients who are hospitalized, the physician said the Massachusetts Department of Public Health is only approving testing for people who have been exposed to someone who has already tested positive or who has traveled to one of the five heavily impacted countries outside the US in the past 14 days, which mirrors CDC guidelines.

""It's insanity,"" said the physician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

There are not even tests on hand to use if a patient was approved for testing, the doctor said.

""Even if the patient were around and exposed to someone coughing, sick, sneezing, I cannot give them a coronavirus test,"" the doctor said. ""We are being crippled by our department of public health and the CDC on our ability to combat this pandemic.""

The doctor said state and federal health officials ""need to loosen the criteria on testing"" and ""allow us doctors to use our discretion to decide who should be tested.""

As of Wednesday only 11,079 specimens had been tested in the US, paling in comparison to the more than 230,000 people tested in South Korea, which has about one sixth the US population.

As of 10 a.m. Thursday, there were 81 public health labs that are verified and offering testing for coronavirus, including at least one in all 50 states and Washington, DC, said Michelle Forman, a spokesperson for the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Forman said her association estimates the nation's public labs could run up to 10,000 tests a day.

A big jump in testing is needed to get through crisis, experts say

Infectious disease experts say more testing is critical to prevent the spread of the disease.

Dr. Rod Hochman, CEO of Providence St. Joseph Health, an organization of 51 hospitals and about 1,000 clinics, described testing capacity in the US as highly deficient.

""We're still not at levels where we need to be. This has been really slow to get started,"" said Hochman, who said his organization is currently relying on public lab testing but added that he's been in close contact with commercial diagnostic companies, which he believes will begin testing soon.

Hochman said the turnaround time on testing results has ranged from 24 hours to four days, which he called ""unacceptable.""

""Testing is so critically important because it helps us as clinicians figure out the extent of the spread. It has implications for how we care for patients and where we put them,"" Hochman said. ""It's unraveling the detective story of how the virus spreads but we are trying to do it now with no data.""

If cases of the disease are not identified quickly and community spread continues unchecked, it could soon overwhelm the nation's medical system, just as it did in Wuhan, China, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.

""Now, we're at the critical point where we have to have a big jump in testing and then quarantining and isolating individuals,"" in order to slow the spread of the virus, he said.

But the reality for many Americans is that they are asking for tests and being turned away.

Anger, frustration, fear: Patients describe testing rejection

Hilal Bayrak of Santa Clara, California, was among those who said he couldn't get the peace-of-mind a test might bring. He came down with a 104 degree fever and started coughing and wheezing about a week ago. He had been working alongside a co-worker who had just returned from Italy. The two shared a keyboard, he said.

His 4-year-old daughter first developed a fever and then a few days later, he and his wife came down with one. Last Saturday, they all went to the emergency room. Each tested negative for flu. Their chests were X-rayed. Same thing -- nothing alarming. Bayrak asked if they could be tested for coronavirus and he says was told that was impossible.

In order to be prioritized for testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that one must have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing as well as have been in close contact with a person known to have coronavirus. Or, they had to ""have a history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of their symptom onset.""

Bayrak appealed to ER workers, telling them about his co-worker's recent visit to Italy, a country that has all but shut down while authorities attempt to contain the fast-spreading virus.

It didn't work.

""I was angry. I was frustrated,"" he said. ""What's more surprising is that after we left the ER on Saturday they told me to follow up with them if my symptoms got worse. They did. My fever was persistent. I took Motrin, Tylenol every 4 hours. I started having continuous headaches. I had no energy. At the moment, I have a rash on my body.""

So the 40-year-old called the ER Wednesday and reported that. ""They told me the same thing. I cannot get tested.""

In Washington state, as many as 18 firefighters and paramedics who believe they were exposed to people who tested positive for the virus cannot themselves get tested because they have shown no signs of illness, several firefighters and public information officers told CNN.

""That's very concerning,"" said Gabe DeBay, a firefighter and paramedic in King County.

Dawn Clements has been sick since March 6. The 49-year-old lives in a Largo, Florida, assisted living facility because she suffers from health problems, including a compromised immune system.

Clements said her daughter, 16, suffered from a 103-degree fever and a burning sensation in her lungs two weeks ago, but tested negative for flu. Clements said she began experiencing similar symptoms after taking care of her daughter, and also got a negative flu test.

She says while her daughter has recovered, she has not. Neither has been able to be tested for coronavirus.

""I was told I didn't meet the criteria because I did not travel out of the United States to one of the countries (with spreading coronavirus). I don't know what virus I have. I'm running a fever and I have chest congestion, and nobody can test us here.""

You need to 'advocate for yourself'

Pinellas County, where Clements resides, is ""prioritizing testing,"" according to the state health department.

""It's a situation where the most likely to have Covid-19 are being prioritized for testing, and those are people who have been travelling overseas to an affected area or in close contact with a known Covid-19 patient,"" said health department spokesman Tom Iovino. ""We have lots of 'worried well' people who are just wanting to be tested. We are following the CDC advice, prioritizing testing.""

In some cases it's not the infected person who wants testing done, but the loved ones around them.

Shelby Koser, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mom from Minnesota, said she's worried about her dad, who suffers from asthma and has been battling a cough and fever. She said her 60-year-old father was diagnosed with bronchitis, but that she's skeptical.

""My dad does not normally get this type of sick,"" she said.

Koser said her father is ""too stubborn"" to ask to be tested for Covid-19, and that she and her mom are worried for his health and that of those around him.

""I've got two young kids,"" Koser said. ""My concern is that the government isn't testing enough people and that a lot of people already have it.""

Where testing issues started

The struggle some faced in getting tested in the US contrasts sharply with the experiences of patients elsewhere in the world.

In Australia, where testing is free and easily available, actors Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, learned they had come down with the virus.

Some of the people contacting CNN complained of symptoms and circumstances more severe than the ones publicly shared by the actors and said they were still denied tests.

The ability for public health labs to test for the virus was hindered last month when the CDC announced that some test kits shipped to labs were not working properly. The CDC announced it was remaking parts of them.

Lab directors and workers are upset by what they say is a lack of follow-up information from the CDC, said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He's spoken to lab directors and workers.

""From a morale and readiness perspective, labs were frustrated by the delays and the silence from the CDC,"" he said.

The Centers' rollout of lab testing ""didn't go as quickly and smoothly as we usually see,"" acknowledged Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director in an interview that aired Thursday with CNN's Sanjay Gupta.

She described the effort to get tests to public labs as ""a bit delayed"" but also blamed commercial labs, saying they were ""really slow to take this on and scale up.""

Now, weeks into the crisis, Schuchat said ""the jury's out on what exactly is the best way to roll out testing.""

""I've heard from colleagues in other countries about concern that there was so much testing going on that people with no symptoms and people who were not at risk clogged up the healthcare systems,"" she added.

Asked how easy it would be for someone to get tested who is showing symptoms, Shuchat told Gupta, ""Well I think an important thing is to be connected to the healthcare system to figure out if you need testing. You know, it may not be the best thing to go into a clinic and ask about that. It may be better to call.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was more direct in his remarks to Congress Thursday.

""The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it -- we are not set up for that,"" he said. ""Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not.""",Coronavirus test: confusion over availability and criteria is leaving sick people wondering if they're infected,"""Even if the patient were around and exposed to someone coughing, sick, sneezing, I cannot give them a coronavirus test,"" the doctor said.
""We are being crippled by our department of public health and the CDC on our ability to combat this pandemic.""
Forman said her association estimates the nation's public labs could run up to 10,000 tests a day.

866,https://us.cnn.com/2017/11/30/opinions/rt-foreign-agent-media-transparency-nossel-opinion/index.html,"Suzanne Nossel is executive director of PEN America. She was formerly executive director of Amnesty International USA and deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations at the State Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) RT -- the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as ""Russia Today,"" frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot , publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.

Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the ""Foreign Agents Registration Act,"" or FARA , a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.

Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.

The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the ""About Us"" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.

News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.

Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, ""The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda.""

In late October Twitter announced that it would ""off-board"" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.

Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.

While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.

In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.

With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.

If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.

We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.

In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.

Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.

It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself.",Branding news outlets as foreign agents won't make them any more transparent,"Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week.

For Niger-born architect Mariam Kamara, the 2018 Rolex Mentor and ProtÃÂ©gÃÂ© Arts Initiative presented her with a tremendous opportunity. The two-year program, which pairs emerging creative talents with masters in their field, saw her working under the guidance of British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye, and allowed her to realize her dream of designing an arts center in Niger's capital city, Niamey. But it also exposed her to her most formidable and outspoken critics yet: a group of high school students.

Though the West African country has one of the youngest populations in the world, literacy rates are low, so Kamara, who founded sustainable design practice Atelier Masomi in 2014, felt it was necessary to create a center that responded to their needs.

""What I had the privilege to do is to really allow (the students) to guide what this project becomes,"" she said over the phone. ""So before Rolex even saw a glimpse of it, I went through the much scarier task of showing it to them. I was nervous because I wanted to make sure that the things we talked about found their way into the design.""

The students told her they wanted a place to read and participate in the arts that reflect their identities as Nigeriens, while also looking to their future. To meet that request, Kamara unveiled her plans for an arts center that also houses an auditorium, a gallery and the city's first public library last year. Once completed (construction begins this summer), the Niamey Cultural Center will be a place for learning, creativity and community-building.

Like her previous projects in the city, the cultural center will be built using compressed earth bricks -- a breathable material responsive to Niger's desert climate and a reflection of local vernacular architecture. The design encompasses four 155-foot curved towers that not only help to cool the interior of the main building by creating facilitating natural ventilation, but also create shaded public courtyards and passages that are accessible to all.

""I know there are people who may not feel that they can enter this large structure because it's very intimidating. So I asked what it means to create space for everyone,"" she said. ""My answer is that it can't be just one big building... I am interested in a structure where you can have a promenade that allows you to be in the space without having to go in.""

The center's location along a valley -- between the French colonial part of the city where the wealthy reside and the side where the less well-off live -- is also significant. Kamara hopes the center will encourage disparate societal groups to come together.

Kamara left Niger to attend university in the United States in 1997. Originally qualifying as a computer scientist, in her 30s she decide to follow her passion for architecture and retrain at the University of Washington.

Though Kamara now splits her time between Niger and Providence, Rhode Island, it's her projects in her home country, blending contemporary and traditional influences, that have earned her the most acclaim and accolades, including the prestigious Prince Claus Award last year.

Her design for a market in the remote village of Dandaji, which includes colorful recycled metal canopies surrounding a sacred tree, has become a vital space for vendors in the region to do trade. And Hikma, the religious and secular complex she designed for the same village in 2018, saw Kamara transforming a derelict Hausa mosque into a library with the help of the adobe masons who originally built it, and created a new, larger mosque alongside it from materials sourced within a three-mile radius. The project was made in collaboration with Iranian architect Yasaman Esmaili, with whom she co-founded the global collective united4design in 2013. The two also co-designed the Niamey 2000 low-cost residential project in 2016.

Kamara said the limitations of working in a country with so few resources has forced her to hone her approach. ""There is something very useful about that scarcity. It clarifies your thinking. It really makes it about space rather than bells and whistles.""

""You cannot hide a bad space when you don't have access to shiny things,"" she continued. ""It becomes more about what the space is doing and how it is bringing people together. That for me is what architecture is about.""

She feels this is especially important at a time when construction has become a significant contributor to pollution in large cities. ""It's impossible to ignore all the climate-related issues,"" she said. ""We need to figure out what progress looks like when it's not fed by exploitation, and recognize our mistakes in terms of construction, material and resource-depletion. Now Asia, South America and Africa can be trailblazers. For me that means there is an opportunity to make a real contribution.""",How architect Mariam Kamara is masterminding a sustainable future for Niger,"Written by Neo Maditla, CNNFor Niger-born architect Mariam Kamara, the 2018 Rolex Mentor and ProtÃÂ©gÃÂ© Arts Initiative presented her with a tremendous opportunity.

Photographer Elena del Estal couldn't help but wonder about those already living with the disease

(CNN) Imagine sitting on a dusty, busy street in New Delhi, crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market. A woman's lapis-colored sari swishes past you in the golden-colored dusk. You've been here since morning.

A tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill. You try to lift your hand to accept, but you can't. The muscles are paralyzed, and your mind can't command them to move. You use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee. Then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day.

This is everyday life for Bipin Kumar. Kumar, known as BK, contracted polio as a child, and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives. Kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him, so he moved to New Delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could -- begging on the streets.

Photographer Elena del Estal was in India last year when the World Health Organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country.

He previously was senior director for counterterrorism and deputy legal adviser at the National Security Council. The views expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion articles at CNN.

(CNN) Someday, Donald Trump will become ex-President Trump. After a guilty plea from his longtime ""fixer,"" Michael Cohen, alleging that Trump directed the commission of federal crimes, perhaps that day will arrive sooner rather than later. But whether it's a week, 18 months or more than six years away, we need to start preparing now. That's because, for all of the threat to our democracy Trump poses as president, he may pose an even bigger one as an ex-president.

No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he'll resign. Maybe he'll be impeached. Maybe he'll be voted out in November 2020 -- or maybe he'll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.

But, however he becomes an ex-president, it's impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon's post-presidency footsteps -- ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.

Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused , even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that's careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there's been one constant: a thirst for more attention.

So imagine ex-President Trump tweeting out real-time commentary on every move his successor makes. Imagine him continuing to fire up crowds at the campaign-style rallies he hasn't stopped doing even as a sitting president. Imagine him starting his own news media empire -- just as he apparently planned to do if he lost in 2016. He will be loud.

And he will be dangerous. Already, Trump is casting doubt on the validity of the upcoming midterm elections, suggesting that Moscow is intervening to favor the Democrats and predicting violence if Democrats reverse Republican gains. Already, Trump is indulging the voices of white supremacism and paranoia, finding moral equivalence ""on both sides"" in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, and criticizing tech companies for removing the hate-filled conspiracy theories of Alex Jones and his Infowars. Already, Trump is baselessly attacking other presidents, accusing Barack Obama of surveilling him and planting a spy in his campaign.

Now imagine what Trump will be without White House advisers surrounding him and at least trying to rein him in. Imagine how he might cast doubt on election results, especially ones that have landed him out of office. Imagine how he might seek to rally support wherever he can find it, even among the most extreme voices in our society. Imagine what he might accuse a successor of doing -- especially one who's just beaten him -- given what Trump has said about a predecessor against whom he didn't even run and who went out of his way to be cordial in the transition between them.

And think about Trump's supporters. For many who felt that they didn't have a voice in Washington, Trump was, at last, that voice. They won't want that voice to go silent. That's particularly true if they feel that, just as Trump told them , the system proves ""rigged."" They'll surely feel that way if Trump's impeached or effectively forced to resign. But, even if he's voted out -- or even if he serves for eight years but claims to have been hamstrung for much of it by a purported ""witch hunt"" led by special counsel Robert Mueller -- Trump's supporters will feel that they and he never really got a fair shake. And, as he always does, Trump will indulge that view -- indeed, he'll stoke it.

Our nation's thought leaders need to develop and agree to principles now to mitigate the looming threat posed by ex-President Trump. One might apply to the next president, whether Democratic or Republican: Simply do not engage with ex-President Trump, no matter how vicious his attacks become; isolate him by ignoring him.

Another might govern both sides of the aisle in Congress: Speak up loudly for the norm of ex-presidents treating their successors -- and the office itself -- with respect, even if they disagree with particular policies. And a third might guide the media: Make a pact (whether or not the likes of Breitbart and Fox News agree to it) not to give ex-President Trump more than perfunctory coverage, whatever invective he hurls and however the public remains fascinated by his norm-shattering behavior.

From the White House to the Capitol to the media, the dangers posed by ex-President Trump put a premium on electing leaders and supporting commentators who can make a compelling -- even passionate -- case for why fundamental norms of American governance and political dialogue need to be restored and protected.

There will, of course, be more to Trump's post-presidency than the man himself: He has introduced ideas that will not simply vanish when he leaves the White House. Some of those ideas concern how presidents (and even presidential candidates) communicate, such as by interrupting and talking over debate opponents as well as by using language -- like Trump's reference to ""s**thole countries"" -- previously unacceptable in mainstream politics or even society.

Some of those ideas relate to particular policies, from Trump's brand of economic nationalism to his insistence that immigration is predominantly a liability for the United States, its security and its identity. No matter how Trump leaves office, those ideas have now been normalized in ways that defy instant reversal. They will need to be addressed by deliberate norm-restoring behavior by future presidents and by the articulation of superior policies by politicians able to make those policies resonate with the public.

819,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/opinions/bernie-sanders-black-voters-opinion-martin/index.html,"Areva Martin is a CNN legal analyst, a civil rights attorney and St. Louis native. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Many of us vividly recall the hotly contested 2016 primary race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, whom I strongly supported. Sanders' message of fighting income inequality and pushing for Medicare for all resonated with many Democratic voters, as it does now, and after winning the New Hampshire primary he seemed to have momentum on his side. But the race inevitably shifted to the South and its heavy contingent of black voters.

Clinton benefited from her husband's popularity with black voters and pulverized Sanders in South Carolina by 47 percentage points. Sanders next got crushed on Super Tuesday, losing the southern and southwest states of Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Texas.

In 2020, Sanders was determined to avoid repeating that history.

He tried to increase his percentage of the black vote by blanketing Facebook with ads that highlighted his long-standing commitment to civil rights. He also talked up issues of paramount importance to the black community -- criminal justice reform and social-economic injustice. Sanders enlisted the help of influential black surrogates such as Harvard Professor Cornel West and rapper Killer Mike . He began airing a TV ad that features former President Barack Obama's past praise of him, even though he has positioned himself as the anti-establishment candidate. Former Obama aides like David Axelrod questioned the ad given that Sanders and the former President were not particularly close. In Mississippi , his campaign funded an ad campaign on black radio.

But despite all this, Sanders once again failed miserably with black voters. He got crushed, again, in South Carolina and then suffered a blowout loss on Super Tuesday.

And Tuesday night, he suffered perhaps a fatal blow by losing the three Ms -- Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan.

So, what did Sanders do wrong this time? Well, it didn't help that on the Sunday before Super Tuesday he failed to appear at a Bloody Sunday ceremonial event in Selma , Alabama, that honors the civil rights leaders who marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

Sanders compounded that mistake by canceling a rally in Mississippi . Perhaps unknown to him is that many African Americans from my hometown of St. Louis hail from the South and have deep ties to blacks in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. Sanders' actions were an affront not just to those southerners, but to blacks in Missouri.

Another crucial mistake by the presidential hopeful was his failure to control the vitriol coming from his ""Bernie Bro"" supporters. One example: After Joe Biden trounced Sanders in South Carolina by garnering 61% of the black vote, one Sanders supporter explained Biden's victory on Twitter, saying, ""People won't say it but the truth is that many voters in SC are low information voters. Which is a nice way to put it.""

Since South Carolina's Democratic electorate is more than 60% African American, the perception is that the Sanders supporter was equating ""low information voters"" to black voters who support Biden.

In fact, exit polling shows that white voters favored Biden to Sanders by a margin of 33% to 23% and that those with advanced degrees preferred Biden over Sanders 51% to 15%.

Sanders' relentless attacks on millionaires and billionaires didn't resonate with a large segment of the black community that takes pride in the successes of black billionaires such as Robert Smith , who paid off the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class at Morehouse College. Sanders doesn't seem to understand that although many African Americans suffer from an economic system stacked against them, we are economically aspirational.

Many African Americans applaud the high achievement and success of billionaires like Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z and Michael Jordan.

But Sanders' biggest mistake, undoubtedly, was his failure to understand the mindset of middle-aged and older African Americans.

For many of these voters, Trump's relentless attempts to dismantle Obamacare and destroy the entire legacy of the first black president -- Barack Obama -- has been an unending nightmare. The unyielding assault and systematic attack on other prominent African American leaders, like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and the dismantling of safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for seniors made removing Trump from office a pivotal issue for many black voters.

Joe Biden is not the perfect candidate. I take issue with many of the votes he cast as a senator and I wish his candidacy resonated more with younger voters. But Biden understands the importance of black voters and he has his pulse on the electorate. He had a regular presence in African American churches and gained the support of 100 black faith leaders in South Carolina leading up to the state's primary.

Many African Americans feel his concern for the problems plaguing our community is genuine, which is why he has scored overwhelming victories over Sanders in every state with a sizable number of black voters.

(CNN) Alcohol has many uses in a time of pandemic. One of them even comes recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 60% or higher alcohol by volume hand sanitizer (70% for cleaning surfaces) can help. Under the threat of coronavirus, just about any form of hand sanitizer or hand wipes are in short supply. Price gouging has begun in some quarters.

493,https://us.cnn.com/travel/article/uruguay-winery-bodega-garzn/index.html,"GarzÃÂ³n, Uruguay (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Terraced vines and spindly olive trees form a patchwork quilt over gently rolling hills, which are themselves covered by a maze of powdery dirt roads. Follow one of these bumpy paths far enough and you'll find an olive oil mill, a farm-to-table restaurant and a hilltop winery.

In fact, if you squint a bit, this place could pass for the famed Italian wine region of Tuscany -- that is, if you can overlook the wild capybaras (the world's largest rodents) and ostrich-like rheas running through the vines. These creatures, of course, are telltale signs you're in a totally different hemisphere on a completely different continent: South America.

It's not that South American wines aren't well known. When experts in California, France or Italy discuss fine wines from South America they typically reference two countries: Chile and Argentina.

Chile revived the lost French grape of CarmÃÂ©nÃÂ¨re and with it, fashioned Bordeaux blends that now rival those from the Old World. Meanwhile, Argentina spearheaded a global craze for Malbec that gave the varietal a permanent home on wine shelves the planet over.

Yet, there's another player that's slowly built up momentum in recent years, thanks, in no small part, to a pioneering new winery that's experimenting with grape varietals and dismantling regional stereotypes.

The country is Uruguay, and the winery is Bodega GarzÃÂ³n

This really is wine country

GarzÃÂ³n lies inland from the fashionable beach town of JosÃÂ© Ignacio, about three hours east of the capital Montevideo. The vines here are barely a decade old, but that hasn't stopped GarzÃÂ³n from racking up an impressive list of accolades.

Suddenly, the world is beginning to give South America's neglected stepchild a closer look.

Uruguay has a 150-year-long history of winemaking, but it's always struggled to get the kind of attention that its neighbors have received for decades.

Size may play a part. South America's second-smallest nation has historically had a wine industry that's slight in scale, miniscule in exports and iffy on quality.

Bodega GarzÃÂ³n is out to change that -- but it hasn't always been easy.

It's on South America's Atlantic Coast

GarzÃÂ³n's wines are influenced by the cool breezes of the nearby Atlantic Ocean. Courtesy Bogeda Garzon

Christian Wylie, the winery's managing director, says one of the biggest hurdles is its location: Many consumers don't even know where Uruguay is. (Hint: it's between Argentina and Brazil on South America's Atlantic Coast.)

""When we have tastings of GarzÃÂ³n wine around the world, one of the first things we do is show them a map,"" he says. ""We explain that Uruguay is at the same latitude as wine regions in Chile, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.""

In other words, the conditions are there to make great wine.

What makes Bodega GarzÃÂ³n so different from nearly every other winery in its own country is that it's located just 11 miles (18 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean.

Not only that, it's in an area that was, historically, little more than pasture for cows. (Uruguayans eat more beef, per capita, than any other country on Earth. Take that Argentina.)

Owner Alejandro Bulgheroni, a billionaire businessman from Argentina, planned to use this land for a wind farm thanks to its cool Atlantic breezes. His wife, Bettina, was concerned about the aesthetics (they have a house nearby) and convinced him to try grapes instead.

Local ocean-influenced wines

That's why Bulgheroni hired the renowned Italian oenologist Alberto Antonini to survey the rolling granitic hills and assess if they might be suitable for vines.

Just over a decade later, the pair has almost single-handedly created a 524-acre wine region while inspiring a local movement in ocean-influenced wines.

Uruguay has about 22,250 acres (about 9,000 hectares) under vine.

Most vineyards face the River Plate in Canelones Department, ""but I don't believe that's the best location,"" says Antonini. ""It's just the closest to Montevideo, where the first European immigrants arrived.""

In GarzÃÂ³n, Antonini and Bulgheroni believe they've stumbled across a new frontier for South American wines.

And Bulgheroni still figured out a way to use wind power.

Making wine the green way

Although his renewable energy project here might never have materialized, he's helped turn this place into the first winery in the world to achieve LEED silver certification for its entire facility, in part, thanks to the way it harnesses wind power. (Developed by the non-profit US Green Building Council, LEED assesses the potential environmental impacts and human benefits of a project.)

The winery's sustainable design includes headline-making features such as the largest green roof with native species in Latin America. The structure, conceived by Mendoza-based architecture firm BÃÂ³rmida & YanzÃÂ³n, was also built into hills and over natural terraces to utilize a gravity flow system for the production of its wines.

Though the winery itself didn't open until 2016, it now lures 20,000 visitors a year to the tiny town of Pueblo GarzÃÂ³n (population 200).

Most come for tours that dip underground into caves filled with barrels, steel tanks and concrete ""eggs"" (the ovular cement tanks that are suddenly all the rage with winemakers). You can also skirt past the abstract sculptural pieces of Uruguayan artist Pablo Atchugarry to tour the production line, which is capable of turning out 200,000 cases annually (though current production is around 110,000 cases).

A posh private club, commercial olive oil mill and 120-seat restaurant led by celebrity chef Francis Mallmann (whose primal technique of open-fire cooking featured on the Netflix series ""Chef's Table"") keep visitors lingering far longer than they might expect.

Part of Bodega GarzÃÂ³n's success in producing fine wine has been selecting varietals that will grow well in Uruguay's hot and humid climate.

Tannat, a highly tannic red wine varietal from the south of France, was already Uruguay's signature grape long before GarzÃÂ³n arrived on the scene. It was a given.

However, the Galician white wine varietal of AlbariÃÂ±o has proved to be one of GarzÃÂ³n's biggest surprises, winning awards for its freshness, minerality and round finish. The winery also gives the Bordeaux blending grape Cabernet Franc a starring turn as a single varietal, highlighting its soft tannins and peppery punch.

The icon wine, Balasto, is a blend of Tannat, Cabernet Frac, Merlot and Marselan. Its name is an homage to the weathered granite found in the soil at GarzÃÂ³n, which allows for drainage during the area's wetter months and keeps the wines here lively, rather than heavy.

Balasto spends 20 months in untoasted French oak barrels and retails for around $100 in the US, reaching a price point few Uruguayan wines could demand a decade ago.

485,https://cnn.com/travel/article/non-alcoholic-cocktails-boom/index.html,"London (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Up until relatively recently, non-alcoholic cocktails seemed like merely an afterthought for most bars.

As a result, teetotalers were often left with little choice but to guzzle juice, soda or water all night.

Those booze-free cocktails that did feature on drinks menus tended to be made up of popular cocktails minus the alcohol, which often left those buying them feeling shortchanged.

But the demand for non-alcoholic drinks has risen rapidly since then, as has the amount of high quality low and zero proof alcohol products available.

Now it seems mixologists are finally devoting as much time and effort into creating booze-free cocktails as alcoholic ones.

The spirit is usually replaced with something like Seedlip, a non-alcoholic botanical spirit, or Everleaf, an alcohol-free aperitif drink, although some bars have gone as far as to make their own hydrosols, or ""flower waters,"" using a rotovap, a device used for distilling.

Hamish Smith, Bars Editor of Drinks International , a revered global drinks journal, says this is a much welcome change.

""[It's] not an apologetic few lines at the back,"" says Smith. ""We're talking crafted cocktails that just so happen to not contain alcohol.""

Burgeoning market

Will Meredith, head bartender at Lyaness, says non-alcoholic cocktails are better than ever nowadays. CNN

The success of Dry January, which encourages participants to forgo alcohol for the first month of the year, has also had an impact -- 21% of US drinkers took part last year according to market research firm Nielsen.

Unsurprisingly, non-alcoholic cocktail sales are usually at their highest during this time, which means bars are having to up their game to ensure they can attract and cater for every type of customer.

""I definitely think we're moving away from a world where syrup topped up with a soft drink constitutes a non-alcoholic cocktail,"" says Will Meredith, head bartender for Lyaness, a popular London cocktail bar.

At Lyaness, the reincarnation of World's Best Bar 2018 winner Dandelyan, the commitment to non-alcoholic cocktails is clear.

When dreaming up their drinks menu, the team went to great pains to ensure there was a booze-free version of as many cocktails as possible.

""Non-alcoholic drinks are massively important to us. It's something we've always put a lot of love and time into,"" adds Meredith.

""Consumers who come into this bar, come for the whole experience. The experience isn't [and shouldn't be] dependent on what they're consuming.""

While the numbers vary from country to country, alcohol consumption is declining globally on the whole.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a nearly 5% point decrease, from 47.6% to 43%, in the number of drinkers across the world since 2000.

Although there doesn't seem to be a definitive explanation for this -- health consciousness is thought to among the contributing factors -- it's clear there's been a shift in attitudes towards alcohol.

According to Meredith, the customers who opt for non-alcoholic cocktails at Lyaness range from bankers to new mothers, while some choose to switch between booze-free cocktails and alcoholic ones.

""Non-alcoholic serves aren't anything new, but what is new is that they are taken seriously -- by bartenders and their customers,"" says Smith.

""Millennials and (drinking age) Generation Zs are drinking less, but don't want to be left out -- they want to experience cocktail bars in the same way drinkers do.

""The bar world has reacted -- it has to. After all, bartenders' raw material is liquid -- it doesn't always have to be alcoholic.""

The cocktails at Lyaness consist of seven core ingredients -- infinite banana, purple pineapple, king monkey nut, ONYX, aromatized milk wine, old fashioned whiskey and ultra raspberry.

Related content This bar got famous not serving alcohol

Meredith says the mixologists always have a non-alcoholic version in mind when choosing a base spirit to compliment the main ingredient, and will keep looking for a suitable booze-free option until they've exhausted all avenues.

He makes a point of referring to the drinks as non-alcoholic cocktails rather than ""mocktails,"" as they're often called, explaining the label has negative connotations.

""The word 'mock' in itself means a bit of a lighthearted joke,"" Meredith points out.

Of the 20-plus cocktails on the menu here, there are seven non-alcoholic versions.

Among the most popular is Tattie Milk Punch, made up of vegan honey, ""potato cream"" and Aecorn (a non-alcoholic aperitif) and Seedlip Spice.

Pina Leaf High Ball, consisting of purple pineapple, gooseberry, salted pineapple leaf, soda and Seedlip Grove is also a favorite.

Costly experience?

The non-alcoholic version of the Pina Leaf High Ball is one of the most popular boozeless cocktails. CNN

One of the most surprising elements about the rise in non-alcoholic cocktails is the amount customers are prepared to pay for them -- although some may argue waking up without a hangover after a night out drinking is utterly priceless.

A standard cocktail at Lyaness, costs between ÃÂ£10 to ÃÂ£15 ($13 to $19) while a non-alcoholic cocktail is priced at around ÃÂ£7 (around $10).

Although the booze-free versions are significantly cheaper, $10 still feels like a sizable amount for a non-alcoholic drink.

So why are customers seemingly happy to splash the cash?

""I think the driving force has been this transition away from putting the value of a drink on the alcoholic content,"" says Meredith, stressing that bartenders have to put a lot of effort into crafting great tasting non-alcoholic cocktails ""without the luxury of booze.""

He also emphasizes Lyaness' non-alcoholic cocktails are made with high end products such as vegan honey and homemade cordials, which are factors in the total cost.

""Non-alcoholic cocktails are becoming so much more in depth, intricate and balanced than they've ever been,"" he adds.

""So the people who weren't drinking [before] now finally see something of value they can consume, and they're willing to pay the money that's required to enjoy it.""

The ever-growing number of non-alcohol products entering the drinks market has allowed bars like Lyaness to be even more creative with its non-alcoholic additions.

These include Stryyk, a non-alcoholic rum made of cane sugar, vanilla and oak and CaleÃÂ±o, a distilled spirit with botanicals, as well as Seedlip and Everclear.

And with more and more similar products launching every year, as well as the emergence of new alcohol-free bars such as New York's Getaway bar and Redemption Bar in London, it's likely demand will continue to grow.

""There are a lot of people who are doing amazing things in the non-alcoholic industry at the moment,"" says Meredith.

""As long as we put our foot on the gas and don't let up, it's only going to get better.""

In fact, the non-alcoholic beverage market is expected to reach a record value of $1,650.28 billion globally by 2024, according to a report by Zion Market Research

""This isn't a trend,"" says Smith. ""It's how things will be from now on in.""",How non-alcoholic cocktails are shaking up the bar scene,"Now it seems mixologists are finally devoting as much time and effort into creating booze-free cocktails as alcoholic ones.

(CNN) ""We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus ... I will always put the well-being of America first."" After weeks of downplaying the outbreak, US President Donald Trump addressed the nation last night, announcing a suspension of travel from Europe and emergency action to help Americans affected by the virus.

Yet the speech -- in which he described the disease as a ""foreign virus"" and blamed Europe for its spread to the US -- brought more confusion to an already rattled nation. Trump's administration was later forced to clarify that the ban would apply to ""people, not goods,"" and only to foreign nationals, not Americans who had been screened before entering the country.

But as infections in the US soar past 1,200 , communal spread appears to be more of a threat than foreign transmission. States are demanding more test kits amid a continued shortage, begging the question of whether the number of reported cases reflects the reality of the crisis.

Trump spoke to the nation at a fearful moment, Stephen Collinson writes . Schools across the country are closing, the NBA basketball league has been suspended, and hospitals are on high alert.

Around the same time Trump was speaking, actor Tom Hanks , known affectionately as ""America's dad,"" announced in an Instagram post from Australia that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the disease.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Airlines and passengers scrambling

""If the leader of the free world is telling you that, you know, your travel is being affected, I would think that we have to give you your money back."" That was the advice of an airline worker at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to passengers waiting to board a flight to Dublin moments after Trump announced his new travel ban. Airlines are scrambling to understand and implement the restrictions, as travelers race back to the US before the deadline or weigh canceling trips, Madeline Holcombe writes

The 30-day ban, which starts at 11:59 p.m. Friday, applies to 26 European countries; it doesn't apply to the UK, despite a spike in cases there. Americans and US permanent residents will still be allowed to fly to Europe and return to the US, but will be screened upon re-entry and face quarantine or restrictions on movement for 14 days. It's not clear whether airlines will still fly the routes if passenger demand from European nationals dries up.

In a strongly-worded statement, the European Union said it disapproved of the ban, which was imposed ""without consultation.""

The UK said today that it would not introduce US-style travel bans, but others are. The Czech Republic will enforce controls on its borders with Germany and Austria; India has suspended all visas until April, effectively barring all foreigners from visiting; and Australia has extended its travel ban for Italy, Iran, China and South Korea.

NBA suspends season

""What we really need to cancel is 2020!"" said Los Angeles Lakers star Lebron James after the NBA suspended its entire season . In Oklahoma City, fans were getting ready for the start of a game between the Thunder and the Utah Jazz last night when players abruptly walked off the court -- one had tested positive for the disease. The decision by one of the world's most profitable sports leagues comes amid growing cancelations and adjustments across the globe.

The latest: the World Figure Skating Championships has been canceled, NCAA Division I Men's and Women's basketball tournaments will proceed but without spectators, and Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers are working on ""alternative plans"" for their regular season opener. But officials organizing the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo still say that canceling the games is ""unthinkable.""

770,https://us.cnn.com/2019/07/20/health/iyw-cities-losing-36-million-trees-how-to-help-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""

""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

422,https://us.cnn.com/style/article/serpentine-pavilion-beijing-jiakun-architects/index.html,"Written by Aric Chen

Aric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.

Upon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.

As a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery's hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London's Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.

We should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum

But mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as ""low-tech,"" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.

""His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,"" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.

Liu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural ""realism."" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.

Centered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.

But as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them "" Rebirth Bricks "") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.

Shifting attitudes

A stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.

Even the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.

Often small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.

""He's the right architect at the right time,"" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.

According to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of ""junzi,"" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.

""I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,"" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. ""It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.""

Put another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).

Nonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing's inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.

The country's architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come.",Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"An early rendering of the Serpentine Pavilion Beijing, designed by Jiakun Architects.

282,http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/10/us/other-gun-lobby/,"They are, sadly, growing in number: Americans devastated by gun violence. The connections they've forged are strong. But can they defeat the NRA?

Their personal families are shrinking, while their ranks are growing: Families whose loved ones have been killed or wounded by guns.

They vow this time is different. They're no longer a loose patchwork of grass-roots groups that emerge after the latest mass shooting -- only to get outspent by the NRA's war chest, their hopes for ""common sense"" gun measures dashed.

The Loneliest Club They are survivors of gun violence. But they have more than that in common. They share a conviction: to use the worst days of their lives to make America a safer place. READ MORE

This time, they have the backing of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his $50 million donation. They are Everytown for Gun Safety, which in 2014 brought under one umbrella Bloomberg's two previous gun groups, Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.

Their focus is on field operations, to mobilize their 3 million members on this single issue and then get supporters to the polls. They steal tactics from the National Rifle Association and study other groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving that have won victories against massive industries.

They gather in cities around the country to learn how to target policymakers and stay unified. They plan rallies and organize on social media. They circle states where change is most possible. They work with the Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords' organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, on federal legislation. They've found an ally in the White House.

They are the ""other"" gun lobby, unafraid of the NRA and its fervent backers.

Andy Parker took on the NRA after his daughter was killed on live TV.

The most powerful message lies within its survivors' network -- some 800 people who've had a loved one killed or wounded by a gun.

This determined crowd turns the conversation around on the most stridently pro-life conservatives: What are you doing to save the lives of America's children from gun violence?

They make lobbying one click away:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Call your senators and demand a vote on universal background checks

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Send your condolences to those affected by the mass shooting in Oregon

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Join your local Moms Demand Action chapter

Everytown's efforts have already scored some victories. In Washington state, nearly 60% of voters supported mandatory background checks on private gun sales, closing a loophole that advocates say will keep guns from falling into the wrong hands. Oregon voters earlier this year passed a similar measure -- the sixth state to do so since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Everytown is next turning to background check ballot initiatives in Nevada and Maine.

Victories have taken shape in other forms, too.

Just this year, they defeated bills across 23 states that would have either let people carry guns in public schools or college campuses or would have let them carry concealed, loaded handguns in public with no permit and no training. They also defeated attempts to repeal universal background checks for all gun buyers in Colorado, and for all handgun buyers in Iowa and North Carolina.

Reporter Alison Parker and her cameraman were shot to death in August.

Eight states also passed laws to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.

The voices of these mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters have joined forces with the likes of Amy Schumer, Julianne Moore, Yoko Ono, Rosanne Cash and Don Cheadle. Those celebrities have formed an 80-person council to advocate for awareness of gun violence.

There seems to be a renewed urgency like never before -- that enough is enough.

For those within the survivors' group, their message is punctuated by that chilling, awful day when they got the news of a slain loved one. Reliving those memories has become a permanent part of their lives. A message, they say, America must hear.

This time, they won't be silenced. They don't want to ban guns. Many pack heat themselves. They just want to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, the seriously mentally ill and others who may pose a danger. If enacting universal background checks saves just one life, they ask, then isn't it worth it?

And so it is through these bonds of determination they unite. Friendships are formed.

""If we have to outspend the NRA, then that's what we'll do,"" Andy Parker says. ""We have dough behind us.""

Parker was thrust into the spotlight when his daughter, Alison, a TV reporter in Roanoke, Virginia, was killed along with her cameraman, Adam Ward, on live television in August. Ever since, her father has pushed for new measures to reduce gun violence.

Lori Haas has fought for tighter gun laws since the Virginia Tech massacre.

""I have the moral high ground here,"" he says.

But even he's been turned away by some of the nation's political leaders, politicians, he says, who take their ""cues from the NRA [rather] than trying to save lives.""

""They're pro-life, but after you're born all bets are off,"" Parker says. ""It doesn't make you feel really good.""

Parker has been aided in his fight by Lori Haas, who has advocated for changes to America's gun laws since her daughter, Emily, was shot and wounded in the Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 people dead.

Parker reached out to Haas shortly after his daughter was killed when he read a quote of hers about the power of the current movement. ""Our elected leaders will be booted out of office if they don't do something,"" she said.

The two now meet regularly. They stay at each other's homes. They've targeted Virginia lawmakers who they believe are vulnerable in November and are working to get their message out in those districts. They write op-eds. They speak on TV and radio. They share posts over Facebook and Twitter. Anything to spread the word.

""The connection is purposeful, but it's also very, very personal,"" says Haas.

Just this week, Parker and another survivor posed questions on Facebook for the Democratic candidates debating on CNN in Las Vegas.

""As president, will you commit to working towards requiring background checks for ALL gun sales?"" Parker asked. Erica Lafferty Smegielski, whose mother was killed at Sandy Hook, wanted to know what three things the candidates would do as president to keep other families from experiencing her pain.

Emily Haas was shot and wounded during the 2007 attack that killed 32.

""The NRA has a 30-year head start on us, but we're catching up now,"" says Parker. ""That's why I have reason for hope.""

Haas says there was little in the way of support after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. At times, she felt alone in her despair to take on the gun industry. Those days are over: ""We now have a platform.""

""Everything about the movement has just grown and grown and grown,"" she says.

Don't mistake their grief as a pity party. Their determination remains unwavering. Undying.

""We are pissed off and we want to do something about this,"" Parker says.

The war for them starts in their home state of Virginia. They've begun drawing up proposals to strengthen what they say are loose gun measures. They've earned the backing of Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

Winning in the state where the NRA is headquartered, they say, would be monumental.

Erica Lafferty Smegielski and Jenna Yuille

Tale of two daughters

Erica Lafferty Smegielski, left, and Jenna Yuille lost their mothers to gun violence.

Their mothers were killed three days apart, in shootings that made national news. Not long after, they both began working to change gun laws.

But it was more than two years before they finally met, during an advocacy training program for survivors in New York.

Participants were gathered for an informal dinner, sitting in a circle and telling their stories. When it was Jenna Yuille's turn, she wept as she spoke.

As she did, Erica Lafferty Smegielski broke down -- ""those big ugly sobs,"" she says, which continued as she hugged Yuille later.

""I didn't know this at the time, but apparently [Erica] was known for being very strong, never crying and just amazingly always holding it together,"" says Yuille.

""I'd never met someone who'd been so impacted in such a similar way,"" says Smegielski. ""It hit too close to home for me.""

Their connection has only grown since then.

""There's a certain drive between us,"" says Yuille. ""We so want to change things for our moms.""

It was December 11, 2012, when Yuille lost her mother to gun violence.

A masked gunman armed with a stolen AR-15 semi-automatic rifle entered a Clackamas, Oregon, mall and fired off more than 60 rounds. Cindy Yuille, a hospice nurse who'd spent her life caring for others, was killed -- along with another man. The shooter then took his own life.

Sandy Hook principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung was killed in the 2012 rampage.

Three days later, on the opposite side of the country, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed six adults and 20 children. Among them was Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the school's principal and Smegielski's mother.

Just that morning, Smegielski had been texting with her mother about her upcoming wedding. They'd picked out the strapless white, long-tiered taffeta gown Smegielski would wear. Now she sent her mother a photo of custom teal-colored Converse sneakers with the words, ""Wedding shoes!""

""You're not going to really wear those, are you?"" her mother typed.

No stranger to her daughter's nontraditional ways, she must have already known the answer. She added a smiley face, one with a wink and a tongue sticking out.

""Yeah. Yeah I am,"" Smegielski, 30, remembers replying. ""I never heard back.""

Seven months later, as Smegielski prepared to walk down the aisle on her wedding day, she rushed off to the nearby cemetery with her grandmother, sister and cousin. She needed a picture with her mother.

Wearing a veil, the dress they'd selected together and those Converse sneakers, she bowed down to kiss her mother's headstone, a moment that was photographed and stays with her always.

""If the closest thing I could get was a piece of granite in the ground, that's what I was going to do,"" Smegielski says.

Yuille, too, treasures an image with her mother.

She holds tight to a photo from her college graduation, taken a year and a half before her mom's death. Around Yuille's neck, and atop her green University of Oregon gown, is a collection of cords, each one representing an honor she'd earned. Her mother stands beside her beaming.

""I miss her every day,"" says Yuille, 26, who works in communications for Nike in Portland. ""I think about how proud she'd be of everything I'm doing.""

Yuille's commitment to reducing gun violence kicked in early. A friend in politics began making connections for her. She testified at hearings. She wrote op-eds and did media interviews. She got involved in statewide elections and helped start Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership. And from the moment she was introduced to Everytown for Gun Safety, she was on board with the cause.

Cindy Yuille was murdered by a gunman who opened fire at an Oregon mall.

Smegielski couldn't return to the job she had before the Newtown shooting. Growing up with a mother who was a special ed teacher, then an administrator, schools had always been her safe place. So she gravitated to that world and worked as a college admissions counselor. After the massacre at Sandy Hook, that sense of safety was gone.

The more involved she got in gun violence issues, her comfort in other places disappeared, too. She won't go to movies and will only rent them. She avoids grocery shopping at all costs. That's what online delivery services are for, if her husband doesn't do it. She's not sure she can bring children into this world -- not just because her mom, who was her best friend, won't meet them but because the staggering statistics of gun violence terrify her.

""I have to make accommodations in my life because people are killed every day,"" Smegielski says. ""It's not a matter of if it will happen again, it's what town will it be? I have too much life left to take chances.""

For two years she's made this cause her profession. Smegielski, who lives in Prospect, Connecticut, is a senior outreach associate for Everytown for Gun Safety. She was in New York training survivor advocates when she and Yuille met.

The commonalities extend beyond losing their mothers to gun violence just days apart and being so close in age. Neither of them had close relationships to fathers or stepfathers. Their mothers were their parents, and their family support systems are small.

Though Yuille has a stepbrother 10 years younger, she was raised an only child. Smegielski has just one sibling, an older sister, who is married with kids. Besides her, her grandmother, her husband and his family, that's it for Smegielski.

They've discussed spending the holidays together. They also think about coming together around the anniversaries of their mothers' deaths so they can celebrate the women who raised them.

They can talk without judgment. They can discuss the merits of antidepressants or anti-anxiety pills without shame. They can lean on each other when new shootings make headlines and, as Yuille puts it, ""It feels like it's happening all over again.""

In spite of the miles that separate them, they vow to be there for each other as life goes on without their mothers.

Lucy McBath and Sharon Risher

The mother and the minister

Lucy McBath, left, reached out to the Rev. Sharon Risher after the Charleston shooting.

She weeps whenever she hears of another shooting, but the news out of Charleston, South Carolina, this summer brought Lucia ""Lucy"" McBath to her knees.

Learning that a gunman's rampage at a Bible study left nine dead made this woman of God crumble.

""I was devastated, as if it had happened to me,"" McBath says. ""I cried myself to sleep.""

The Rev. Sharon Risher was struggling, too. Details were trickling in, but the trauma chaplain was at work in a Dallas hospital, far from the city where she grew up. She had to pull it together to tend to a grieving family before she could focus on her own fears.

She hoped the early reports were wrong and that her momma, Ethel Lance, was OK. Her mother was a faithful member of the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

Calls to Lance's cell phone went unanswered, though, and she understood.

""I knew she was gone because there would have been no other place in the world she would have been,"" says Risher, who also lost two cousins, Susie Jackson and Tywanza Sanders, in the attack.

Risher at her seminary graduation with her mother, Ethel Lance, who was killed in Charleston.

In Atlanta, McBath picked up her pen and got to work. She's a faith and community outreach leader for Everytown for Gun Safety, and writing letters to survivors of gun violence -- including relatives of victims -- is a role she embraces.

She knows the importance because she's been on the other side. In 2012, McBath's only child, 17-year-old Jordan Davis, was shot and killed at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station during a dispute over loud music. She was flooded with cards, emails and Facebook messages -- and she's saved them all.

""That's part of Jordan's legacy,"" she says.

But no one who wrote had suffered as she had. For Risher, she could be that person.

""Nobody can understand what you're feeling and thinking other than someone who's really been through it,"" says McBath, 55. ""I, as a victim, understand completely.""

Risher's mother was the first victim buried after the Charleston shooting. Risher stayed in her hometown for the funeral of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a state senator and Emanuel's pastor. Thousands attended, and President Barack Obama gave the eulogy.

After that, she'd had all she could take of funerals. Back home in Dallas a few days later, she was greeted with a pile of letters and cards, forwarded to her by the Charleston church fondly known as Mother Emanuel. One envelope stuck out because Risher's name was written along the side. Inside she found what she didn't yet know she needed: a two-page handwritten letter with words of sympathy, the story of McBath's own heartache, an outstretched hand in support -- and a personal phone number.

Risher wasn't the only one in need. For McBath, the work she does for Everytown for Gun Safety -- and as a national spokeswoman for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America -- is a source of comfort for herself as well. She's helped promote two documentary films that feature her and her son's stories -- ""3ÃÂ½ minutes, 10 bullets"" and ""The Armor of Light."" She's testified at hearings, spoken at summits, lobbied legislators, created a foundation in her son's name and more.

""We're trying to sort of shove the pain away a bit and work through the pain,"" she says of survivors like herself. ""But then, when I slow down, it comes crashing down on me. ... Two weeks ago, I had a day when I was weeping all day because I missed my boy so much.""

Jordan Davis was killed in Jacksonville, Florida, in a dispute over loud music.

After reading McBath's letter, Risher didn't hesitate. She grabbed her phone and began to dial. That first conversation was more tears than talk.

""She was just pouring out her heart,"" says McBath. ""And I was crying because I hate the fact that she has to go through this.""

In one another, they say they've found a kindred spirit. They relate not just because they've endured similar sorts of shock and pain but because they are both African-American, God-fearing women.

And while race played a part in the shootings that robbed them of loved ones -- in Charleston the gunman wanted ""to start a race war,"" while in Jacksonville the shooter claimed self-defense and reportedly described Davis and his friends as ""thugs"" and ""gangsters"" -- they insist the problem is bigger than that. They want the conversations to be about gun safety, first and foremost.

Risher, 57, is just stepping into the role of activist. She's attended several Everytown for Gun Safety gatherings in Washington and has spoken to media. She thanks God for sending McBath her way. While her own children and others are there for her, McBath offers something no one else can.

""She's been a constant beacon,"" Risher says. ""She's just grabbed me into her bosom and said, 'I'll be here for you spiritually and emotionally, even if I can't be there for you physically.'""

Whether it's quick text messages, phone calls or face-to-face meetings, their connection endures. They've created a safe space for each other. Sometimes they talk about wanting to escape for a girls' weekend, a chance, as McBath puts it, to ""breathe the air outside the tragedy."" Risher imagines someplace warm, where they can ""sit on the beach and drink drinks with umbrellas in them.""

Someday they'll get there, but for now there's too much work to be done.

DeAndra Yates and Diana Alvarado Rodriguez

'From so much pain, there's triumph'

Diana Alvarado Rodriguez, left, was drawn to DeAndra Yates after reading about her son.

DeAndra Yates pounded on the hotel door next to hers. Diana Alvarado Rodriguez, the woman she considers a sister, answered. It was the middle of the night.

""Girl, what's going on?"" Rodriguez said.

""My son!"" Yates cried. ""He's sick and he's been rushed to the hospital.""

Yates had been awakened by a call that took her back to the moment she learned her boy had been shot at a birthday party.

That was more than 1ÃÂ½ years ago. The shooting left Dre a quadriplegic at 13.

Now, the voice on the other end of the line was telling her Dre had suffered two seizures, one lasting 20 minutes.

He needed to be taken from a hospital in Carbondale, Illinois, to a more specialized children's hospital in St. Louis.

His condition was critical.

Yates was hundreds of miles away in Denver, at a conference earlier this month with Rodriguez and other members of the Everytown for Gun Safety Survivor Network.

They had talked about the power of uniting, how to organize and spread their message. How to lean on each other when dark moments strike.

In Rodriguez's hotel room, Yates broke down. Consumed by self-doubt, she wondered: Why did I leave my son's side? How am I going to get back to him?

Dre Yates was shot at a birthday party; the bullet left him a quadriplegic.

Rodriguez immediately swung into action. She rounded up other members of what she calls Team Dre. ""We were able to put to practice what we were being taught,"" Rodriguez says.

Rodriguez knows pain. Her 18-year-old daughter, Samantha Guzman, was shot and killed as she walked home from a party with friends in the Bronx on Mother's Day 2006.

Soon, about six people were gathered in Rodriguez's hotel room. Rodriguez and another woman prayed, while others began booking flights. They weren't going to let Yates fly home by herself. Rodriguez would escort her to the hospital and stay until family arrived.

""I was scared to death. I didn't know what was going to happen to my son,"" Yates says. ""That's the power of the network and the power of the connection that she and I have on a personal level.""

""That was an honor,"" adds Rodriguez. ""It's about being compassionate, about being there for the person when they need you. That's what I wanted: I wanted to be there for her.""

The two women have been constant companions since meeting over Facebook about a year ago. Rodriguez was drawn to Yates after reading posts about caring for her son. A bullet had entered the back of Dre's head and left the former middle school football star using a wheelchair, unable to speak. Success these days is measured by incremental victories, like seeing him smile.

Rodriguez's daughter, Samantha Guzman, was killed walking home from a party.

""It was beautiful -- and it was somebody who had survived. Not too many of our children are surviving this mess that's going on,"" Rodriguez says. ""For me, that was something special because I have always thought: What would've happened if my daughter would have survived?""

When her daughter was killed in 2006, Rodriguez had to figure out how to grieve by herself. There were not many groups for people with loved ones killed by gun violence. Certainly, none reaching out to her at the height of her pain.

She knew the turmoil Yates was suffering. Ever since they connected, they've spoken by phone and texted daily. It's a shared camaraderie that only these families know, a pain so great it reaches into the depth of the soul.

""We share tears and we just talk, you know,"" Rodriguez says.

Yates felt that instant connection, too. When Rodriguez rests her hand on Yates' shoulder, you can see the love the two share. It radiates from their faces. When they speak, they finish each other's sentences. Yates wears a purple and black bracelet for Rodriguez's daughter Samantha. Rodriguez wears a beaded bracelet for Dre.

Just a week before Dre's recent hospitalization, the two shared monumental joy: Dre had walked on a treadmill for the first time since being shot. Now, he was struggling to live.

Yates couldn't have gone through the ordeal without her best friend and the others who support her.

""My son is still struggling with his disabilities, and everyone else has lost their children. People are like: 'Wow, her son is alive, but look at what she's having to go through.' It opens up other survivors' minds -- that this is an everyday battle.

""And for me, I look at them and say, 'I know it's hard for me, but it's even harder for them because they can't even touch or see their child.'""

Rodriguez and Yates vow nothing can break their bond. Don't tell them America's gun laws can't be changed. Because the fact is, Rodriguez says, ""Something's gotta be done. The violence needs to stop.""

But, Yates adds, ""We are learning that something greater is coming out of it. ... From so much pain, we have found triumph.""

Tom Sullivan and Jane Dougherty

'Superman' and the dressmaker

Tom Sullivan ""is our tough guy,"" says Jane Dougherty. ""I'm the heart.""

At home, Jane Dougherty is a mother, wife and bridal dress maker in Littleton, Colorado. But when she talks about the need for tighter gun laws, she speaks as a woman who lost her sister to gun violence.

Mary Sherlach, a school psychologist and Dougherty's older sister, was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut.

Dougherty is often joined in her activism by Tom Sullivan, who lost his son, Alex, in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre five months earlier.

A retired postal worker, Sullivan says he represents the fathers and ""lunch bucket guys"" who try to do everything right and keep their families out of harm's way, only to find that gun violence is random.

Together, they make a formidable pair when they call on Colorado lawmakers to support universal background checks and gun restraining orders for domestic abusers and the mentally ill.

""He's our tough guy. He's the one calling legislators out,"" Dougherty says. ""I'm the heart. I can make legislators cry.""

And they have each other's back.

The two were at the Colorado State Capitol in 2014, waiting outside a committee room to testify, when a man wearing a brown robe emblazoned with gun patches approached Dougherty and started ranting.

""Your sister should've had a gun,"" she remembers him saying. ""If she had a gun she could have shot that guy.""

Alex Sullivan was killed in the Aurora massacre while celebrating his birthday.

Sullivan stepped in and yelled for guards to let Dougherty enter the room and escape the confrontation.

""He was there for me,"" she says. ""He'll always be my Superman.""

Dougherty and Sullivan met at a rally in Denver on the first anniversary of the Aurora shooting. Her sister's death 2,000 miles away inspired Dougherty to work for stricter gun laws in her home state, and Sullivan knew of her activism. They became fast friends, joining Facebook groups for gun violence survivors and getting to know each other's families.

News stories often refer to Sullivan's ""superhero-like"" insistence on creating positive outcomes from shootings. It's part of his ""Irish DNA,"" Sullivan jokes. ""We're kind of built for death and problems in our lives.""

Sullivan and his son bonded over superheroes during regular trips to All C's Collectibles, a comic book store just down the road from where James Holmes killed Alex and 11 others at a midnight screening of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Alex was there with friends to celebrate his 27th birthday.

In the wake of the shooting, Sullivan joined forces with Jason Farnsworth, owner of All C's, to launch Aurora Rise -- a Batman-themed charity that provides financial and moral support to Aurora survivors.

Sullivan also uses his postal service past to reach out to labor unions, a group he says is ""not our friend on gun violence prevention issues.""

The son of Air Force parents, his family moved around before settling in Rochester, New York. He grew up playing sports instead of hunting and fishing. After he joined the Air Force, he picked up a firearm just once -- during basic training.

He married his childhood sweetheart, Terry, and they moved to Colorado in 1980. He got a union job delivering express mail so he could someday retire with a pension. He worked hard to provide for his wife and ""Irish twins,"" Alex and daughter Megan, born 15 months later.

He raised Alex to play by the same rules. Alex wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong time when he was killed, his father says. ""He was right where he was supposed to be, at the movies, celebrating his birthday with his friends.""

Sullivan thought he had done his part to protect his family, and he assumed the gun industry was doing theirs to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.

Then he sat through the trial of his son's killer and was alarmed to learn how easy it was for Holmes to assemble his artillery unnoticed: He had 4,000 rounds drop-shipped to the FedEx near the coffee shop where Megan worked; he periodically showed up at a shooting range with a trunk full of ammo for practice; he spent $11,000 in three months on firearms, tear gas, ammo and body armor.

Dougherty's sister and school psychologist Mary Sherlach was killed at Sandy Hook.

Nobody connected the dots.

""We have a whole section of the government that's supposed to be watching for terrorists coming, and it's pretty clear a terrorist could be sitting right here and order all the ammo he wants,"" Sullivan said.

""You come to learn that it's run by an industry whose only interest is to make money, sell more guns and keep the public scared.""

Before the shooting, Sullivan was a sports fan, another passion he shared with his son. After July 20, 2012, ""that stopped."" Now he's a news junkie, and fighting to change gun laws has become his life.

It's much the same for Dougherty. Like Sullivan, guns were not a part of her life growing up in Binghamton, New York, the fourth of five children. Now, she admits it's an obsession, a promise she made to her sister on the day of her funeral.

A graduate of New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, Dougherty built a successful business designing wedding dresses -- first by word of mouth in Westchester County, then again in Colorado. It's the other half of what she wryly calls her ""sad reality show"" life: ""guns and brides.""

The first time she thought about gun violence was December 8, 1980, when John Lennon was gunned down outside his Central Park West home. She was living in Manhattan at the time, and it felt close to home.

After she moved to Littleton with her first two children in 1992, gun violence continued to swirl around her, getting closer and closer.

First came Columbine, in 1999. She remembers filling up her car at a gas station on the road to Columbine High School when police cars zipped past, sirens screaming. Her children's two schools were locked down.

Then, in 2010, a gunman opened fire outside Deer Creek Middle School, where her youngest daughter, born in Colorado, once attended. Two students were injured before her daughter's former math teacher tackled the gunman.

Dougherty was in her workshop, sewing dresses for clients, when she learned about the shooting at Deer Creek. She was putting the final touches on her daughter's wedding dress in her workshop when she learned about Aurora on TV.

It's also where she was when she got the phone call from her husband saying there'd been a shooting in Connecticut.

She knew that gun violence had finally caught up with her family.

The last time she'd seen Mary alive was that August, at the wedding of Dougherty's daughter. Married for 31 years with two children of her own, Mary had flown in from Connecticut. Though the sisters spoke often by phone, it was a rare reunion, so Dougherty sat Mary at the family table.

""I was selfish and I wanted her at my table because I never get to see her,"" Dougherty says. ""I'll always remember her walking in my house and giving her a hug in my foyer.""

Dougherty has found solace and solidarity with the survivor community. They're like family, which is why she jumped at the chance to help Sullivan's daughter prepare for her own wedding. It would fall during the trial of Alex's killer. Perhaps she could make it easier on them.

After seeing Megan write on Facebook about problems find a wedding dress, Dougherty reached out, reminded her she worked in bridal and invited her to the shop.

Jane Dougherty with her sister on Mary's wedding day in 1981.

Megan came in with her mother, Terry, and chose an A-line strapless dress. Dougherty customized it with a netted neckline and added pearl buttons from Terry's wedding dress up the back.

While working on Megan's dress, she couldn't help but think of the first bridal gown she made. It had been in 1981, when she was still in New York. It was for her sister Mary.

""I was just so happy that Megan was smiling,"" Dougherty says. The dress was her gift -- from one surviving sister to another.

755,https://us.cnn.com/travel/article/egg-tarts-margarets-cafe-e-nata-macao/index.html,"Macao (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ You can smell it before you see it. The sweet smell of sugar, egg and custard, baking til it's cooked just right. Flaky pastry on the outside, soft custard on the inside, and crispy, burnt, sugar on top.

It's the signature smell of Margaret's CafÃÂ© e Nata -- one of the most popular places to eat in Macao, a former Portuguese colony.

The cafe is especially famous for one thing: the Macanese egg tart. It's a sweet pastry inspired by its Portuguese and Chinese counterparts, made fresh daily by owner Margaret Wong.

If visitors aren't there for a treat from the bakery, chances are they're there to see Wong.

After three decades in the food business, she's a colorful personality who still spends every day working hard at the cafe. She can be spotted working the cash register or bustling about in the kitchen.

A family affair

Margaret's CafÃÂ© e Nata's famous Macanese egg tarts. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

Few people know Macanese egg tarts better than Wong, who began making the dish 30 years ago with her late ex-husband Andrew Stow.

The couple founded their first bakery business, Lord Stow's, in 1989. Today, Lord Stow's is run by their daughter Audrey and Andrew's sister Eileen.

Margaret's CafÃÂ© e Nata, which she subsequently founded in 1992, is entirely run by Wong herself.

Some online reports suggest that Wong founded her cafe to compete with Lord Stow's -- which netizens claim was born as a result of a domestic feud following the couple's divorce.

She wouldn't comment on the rumors, though she spoke openly about the early days of their romance.

""We were married three times -- once in Hong Kong, once in England and once in a church,"" she says.

According to Wong, the couple met in a local church, where she played the organ.

""One day my foster mother was visiting from America, and we bumped into Andrew, who gave me a hug and a kiss and I went all red. He was friends with everybody so I didn't think I was anything special ... but my mother said 'Margaret, I think this is the right one for you.'""

The two were married in 1988.

Up to 10,000 tarts a day

Together, the couple created their signature egg tart dish, which is now an iconic Macao dish. Purists argue this egg tart tastes nothing like its Portuguese or Chinese counterparts.

According to Wong, that's the point.

""When we started our bakery, someone asked Andrew to make a pasteis de nata, because they were very popular in Portugal. The first tray came out burnt and wrong, and Andrew wanted to throw them away. I said, hold on, they're edible, so let people just try them. They tried one, and then two, and by the third I said, 'I have to charge you because clearly, it's good!' ""

It's this same recipe, three decades later, that continues to be sold across Macao.

Today, hundreds of tourists and locals alike line up at her cafe for a bite of this now famous pastry.

Wong's cafe alone can make up to 10,000 tarts a day -- all of which are bound to sell out.

""Sometimes people walk in and say -- can I have just one egg tart -- and I say, not even one bite.""

'Like the tart, I never change'

Visitors to Margaret's CafÃÂ© e Nata will usually find her in the kitchen or behind the till. CNN

Every single dish sold by the bakery is graced with Wong's magic touch. In addition to egg tarts, other items on the menu include brownies, cakes and croissants. There's also a salad and sandwich bar.

Despite long working hours, and the physically demanding nature of her work, she still spends almost every day bouncing back and forth between the kitchen and the shop.

""Some of my staff have been working with me for 15 years, they know everything, but still sometimes I have to make sure everything is good -- I'm the boss!"" she says.

336,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/business/orkney-hydrogen-power/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Too much clean energy. It's an unusual problem to have, and one that's spurred a group of islands off the northern coast of Scotland to become an unlikely pioneer in hydrogen power .

Orkney, better known for its breathtaking coastal scenery and some of Britain's oldest heritage sites than for its cutting edge approach to energy , has been quietly pioneering hydrogen technology.

Abundant rainfall, strong winds and powerful waves mean the island chain's entire electricity demand is already met through renewable resources . But in recent years, Orkney's grid couldn't handle the amount of power being generated from its ever expanding wind farms, Megan McNeill, Orkney projects manager at Community Energy Scotland, told CNN Business.

Wind turbines needed to be switched off on a daily basis, as power cables reached capacity, leaving clean energy unused.

Rather than waste the excess electricity, the islands decided to harness it. It was here that in 2017 the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), in a world first, used tidal energy to split water and make hydrogen Ã¢ÂÂ a process known as electrolysis.

That was just the beginning. The success of that project spurred collaboration between EMEC, Community Energy Scotland and others to do the same with excess wind energy. Surf 'n' Turf, a project funded by the Scottish government, combined excess electricity from tidal and wind turbines to create hydrogen, another world first.

Hydrogen is viewed as an important part of the transition to a cleaner future because it emits no carbon. It can also be stored and is seen as a potential replacement to natural gas

But traditional hydrogen production relies almost entirely on fossil fuels and is responsible for 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. That is equivalent to the CO2 emissions of the United Kingdom and Indonesia combined, according to the International Energy Agency.

Producing hydrogen power remains expensive, but Orkney's success in creating hydrogen using clean energy demonstrates that it can be done at scale. The islands are already using hydrogen to power vehicles and a local primary school.

Now, Orkney is hoping to use hydrogen fuel cells to power a seagoing vessel able to transport both goods and passengers.

""We're hoping it can be the world first,"" said hydrogen manager at EMEC, Jon Clipshim, adding, ""there is a race on.""

82,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/05/asia/coronavirus-covid-19-update-india-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) A spike in novel coronavirus in India has prompted concerns that the world's second-most populous country could face a serious outbreak of the virus, which to date has infected more than 95,000 people and killed at least 3,300 worldwide.

Twenty-nine cases have been confirmed inside the country, including three who have recovered. Many of the cases are linked to a group of travelers from Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said.

Authorities in the country have advised caution, but have not raised the alarm. Vardhan told lawmakers in parliament Tuesday that public health authorities are focusing on India's ""core capacities for disease preparedness and response.""

The government has begun screening all passengers arriving in the country for coronavirus.

""The scale and extent of our interventions have increased in alignment the evolving situation of COVID-19 across the world, and India in particular,"" he said, referring to the disease by its formal name. ""With the increasing global spread of the disease, we are confronted with new challenges. The contact tracing of positive cases requires the tracing of hundreds of contacts in multiple locations and monitoring their health.""

Vardhan also said the government was preparing a ""containment plan"" for the city of Agra -- home to the Taj Mahal -- where a cluster of cases has been identified.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said ""there is no need to panic"" earlier this week on Twitter and advised the public that the government is ""working together"" to stop the virus from spreading further.

Modi said Wednesday he would not attend next week's Holi celebrations -- the Hindu festival that marks the start of spring in which revelers throwing bright-colored powdered paint -- because of advice from experts to avoid mass gatherings. Holi festivities at the presidential palace were also canceled.

Authorities around the globe are taking similar steps now that the virus has spread to more than 80 countries and territories across every continent except Antarctica. Since it was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, major self-sustaining clusters have formed in South Korea, Japan -- which recorded its biggest one-day increase of cases on Wednesday , with 33 new patients identified -- parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.

The vast majority of cases, however, are still in mainland China. The country's National Health Commission (NHC) reported that as of the end of the day Wednesday, 3,012 people had died and 80,409 cases had been confirmed. More than 52,000 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, per the NHC.

Economic woes

The virus' spread is also having significant knock-on effects on the global economy and daily life. Markets worldwide have reacted negatively, forcing finance officials and central banks to take action. Government agencies and private companies across the globe have canceled or postponed public functions.

Movie studios MGM and Universal have postponed the release of the latest James Bond movie ; authorities in Japan and Italy have closed major tourist hubs like the Tokyo Skytree or Milan's Teatro alla Scala; theme parks around the world have been shuttered; governments have shut schools; and sporting events in country's most affected areas are sometimes being played behind closed doors.

The outbreak could cost the Travel and tourism has been among the most affected industries.The outbreak could cost the airline industry as much as $113 billion in lost revenue, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

IATA said global passenger growth for January 2020 was the slowest in nearly a decade, climbing only 2.4% from a year earlier, because of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

""January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January,"" Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO, said in a statement.

United Airlines became the first airline to cut its US flight schedule on Wednesday, as passenger concerns about the coronavirus has caused a sharp drop in demand. UK airline Flybe collapsed Thursday as a slump in demand for flights due to the outbreak dealt the final blow to the struggling carrier.

Passenger uncertainty about travel has prompted major US airlines and some international ones to suspend or waive certain change and rebooking fees, which itself is hurting their revenue.

Executives from most of the major airlines, including United CEO Oscar Munoz, met with US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday to discuss the impact of the coronavirus on air travel and how to coordinate activity between the industry and the government.

In response to a question, President Trump said he did not believe that the airlines would need a bailout, similar to the one they received in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

""Don't ask that question please, because they haven't asked (for) that. I don't want you to give them any ideas,"" said Trump about the possibility of a bailout. He said the idea had not been discussed. He also said he believes flying is safe.

""Where these people are flying, it's safe to fly,"" he said.

US attempts to increase testing

On Wednesday , the Vice President said the Trump administration is prioritizing making it easier for Americans to be tested for the virus.

""Our objective is to make tests available broadly to the American public. We want to make sure the American people can go to their doctor, can go to the local MedCheck or CVS, and obtain access,"" said Pence, who Trump tasked with overseeing the federal government's coronavirus task force.

Speaking at a news conference, Pence highlighted the various steps the government is taking to stop the virus from spreading further.

""The risk to the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low. But at the President's direction, we are bringing the full resources, not just of the American government, but the American economy, to make sure that in our meeting with the pharmaceutical companies, that we have -- that we're developing vaccines, which may not be available for another year or year and a half, but we're also developing therapeutics that we believe could be available in fairly short order for people that are struggling with coronavirus,"" he said.

Nearly 160 cases have been identified in the United States and 11 people have been killed. Ten of the fatalities occurred in Washington state , where many of the patients and victims have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. A federal disaster medical assistance team is set to arrive in Kirkland Thursday to help staff at the facility.

The other fatality is in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. Those two states have so far been the hardest-hit, with Washington detecting at least 39 infections and California at least 36.

Newsom also said that one cruise ship off the coast of California, the Grand Princess, has been affected by the outbreak, with 10 crew members and 11 passengers showing virus symptoms. The ship is being held at sea while authorities test for the virus.

Cruise ships can be especially vulnerable to viral illnesses, like the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were infected while aboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise liner that was forced to quarantine most of its guests off the coast of Japan. Forty-six Americans on board the ship who were repatriated from Japan have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.

""There are unique challenges, our experts tell us, in a closed environment"" like a cruise ship, Pence said at his Wednesday briefing.

The House of Representatives passed an $8.3 billion coronavirus response package Wednesday afternoon, far higher than the $2.5 billion the White House requested. Despite that, however, the White House is expected to back the deal. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the measure Thursday.","India identifies 29 coronavirus cases as global infections top 95,000","The government has begun screening all passengers arriving in the country for coronavirus.

1234,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51545344,"Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mohammad Shareef began burying bodies after his son's death

Mohammad Shareef never got to bury his son. Instead, he has spent the last 27 years burying the unclaimed sons and daughters of thousands of other families.

It took a month for police to tell Mr Shareef that his son had died, and even then, they couldn't tell him where, or how.

All Mr Shareef knows is that his son, Mohammad Rais, was one of almost 2,000 people killed in the Hindu-Muslim riots which engulfed India following the destruction of a mosque on a disputed religious site in 1992.

Mr Shareef doesn't even know where the 25-year-old was buried.

""Police told me his body had decomposed,"" Mr Shareef recalled, almost three decades on. ""We didn't see his body. We only got his clothes.""

But a few months later, he would witness something which would change his life forever.

""One day I saw police officers throwing a body into a river. I was horrified,"" Mr Shareef says.

Along with the horror, came a realisation.

""I think my son's body might have been thrown into a river, just like other such dead bodies. That day I said to myself, from today I am the guardian of abandoned dead bodies and I will give them a proper funeral.""

Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mr Shareef says his wife Bibi never recovered from the death of their son

Unclaimed bodies pile up in India for a host of reasons: they could be people who lost their lives in road and rail accidents, or people who died far from home - pilgrims, migrants, old people abandoned by their children.

Some impoverished patients die in hospital with no-one to take care of the funeral.

But what to do with the bodies? Back in 1992, many districts in India didn't have a mortuary facility. It was fairly common practice to dispose of unclaimed bodies quickly.

Burial was the preferred method, but in some places in north India they dumped unclaimed human remains into rivers to save money, time and effort.

More stories from India

Mr Shareef's family have long suspected that Rais' body ended up in the Gomti river. It flows past Sultanpur, the city where the young man had been working as a chemist in December 1992 - the month when Hindu fundamentalists tore down the 16th Century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, Mr Shareef's home, 65km (40 miles) away.

Rais went missing amid the bloodshed which followed.

""After my son disappeared I searched for him everywhere for a month, like a mad man,"" his father says. ""I didn't find him anywhere. I even went to Sultanpur to look for him.""

Then came the news they had been dreading: their beloved son was dead. Mr Sharif and his wife Bibi were traumatised. His wife still struggles with periods of depression to this day.

The pain is aggravated by the fact they were not able to give their son a proper burial. It is a pain no one else should go through, Mr Shareef says.

""I decided that in my district, I wouldn't let any unidentified body be thrown away into a river,"" he says.

Image copyright Mohd Shabir Image caption Shareef says he takes care of the unknown dead persons as he would a family member

In India's caste-bound Hindu society, those who were at the bottom were historically forced to do the job of burial and cremations - and then treated as ""untouchables"" as a result.

But Mr Shareef - a bicycle mechanic by trade - was not to be deterred. He told the police about his desire to take up a task shunned by everyone else.

""When I got the first call, my heart was pounding. After the post-mortem, the police asked me to take away the body. I clearly remember that person's neck was slashed.""

Soon, his workload started to increase. He even bought a four-wheeled cart to transport the dead.

Predictably his family members, friends and neighbours were taken aback. Even as a Muslim, Mr Sharif began to experience the same social exclusion as his Hindu colleagues.

""No-one in my family was happy at that time. They said, 'you have gone mad'.

""Some people were afraid of me. They thought they would get infected with germs if they made physical contact with me.""

Yet Mr Shareef was resolute in his conviction. He had skipped family weddings, festivals and even prayers for the sake of unknown people. It gave him peace and solace: performing last rights is a moment to remember his son.

""It helped me to deal with the pain of my son's death. I think about him all the time. I miss him.""

It is not an easy job. Police often struggle to identify the body, which means they may have been dead for some time. Often it is not the bodies, Mr Shareef says, but the smell which is most off-putting.

""Whenever I see a badly mutilated or decomposed body it is difficult to sleep. I have nightmares and resort to sleeping tablets,"" he explains.

""Sometimes police officials come with me to the cemetery but even they stand far away.""

All the same, he always takes the time to ensure the person is given the proper treatment, usually bathing the body.

If he realises the dead person is Muslim, he wraps the body in a sheet of cloth and recites the final prayers. If the body belongs to a Hindu, he takes it to be cremated.

No-one know exactly how many bodies Mr Shareef has buried. The head of Ayodhya district administration, Anuj Kumar Jha, told the BBC that they don't have full records of the bodies handed over to Mr Shareef.

""Our rough estimate is we would have given about 2,500 bodies to him,"" he said. Mr Shareef's family say he has given last rites to more than 5,500 people.

Yet for years, he toiled without any financial support. To this day, he works in his bicycle shop, earning the equivalent of about $3 a day.

Image copyright Shabir Image caption Mr Shareef continues to run his roadside cycle repair shop to provide for himself and his wife

But things are changing. He has been recognised for his dedication. The government has given him one of India's highest civilian awards, while local shop owners now also help cover his expenses. At the age of 80, he is now able to have two paid assistants who are sharing his burden.

""Both Hindus and Muslims help me. People give me food and warm blankets. Recently I had to have an eye operation - a stranger called me and gave me 20,000 rupees [$290].""

But retirement is not something he is willing to consider. Neither his two surviving sons nor grandchildren want to follow in his footsteps, and he is acutely aware of what will happen if he stops doing this work.

""If I am not there, police will throw the bodies into rivers as they did before.""

For a man who some call the ""saviour of the dead"" that would be unbearable.

""I will continue doing this till my last breath,"" he says.

She is also the author of ""Rwandan Women Rising."" The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) On Thursday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced the end of her presidential campaign after a disheartening performance in the primary elections. Now there is only one woman running for the highest office in the land -- a woman who, by any polling metric, has virtually no chance of winning.

In 2007, when Hillary Rodham Clinton first announced ""I'm in, and I'm in to win,"" she stoked hope in all who dream of political parity -- that a woman could soon be president of the United States. In the immediate aftermath of Clinton's 2016 candidacy, and her loss to a flagrant misogynist, countless women ran for public office.

So, it was promising to see six Democratic women step up to contend for president this time around. Even if two -- author Marianne Williamson and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- seemed to many like longshots, for a variety of reasons, that left four highly qualified women in the race: Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Now, the chance that a woman will win the 2020 presidential race has imploded.

What happened?

There's no question that sexism played a role in bringing us to this point. But social influences are wicked problems: they are diseases, hard to diagnose, even harder to cure.

As is often, perhaps always, the case, these female candidates seemed held to a higher standard when it came to being presidential, electable -- and even likeable. In fact, for women, those three characteristics war with one another. A woman who seems nurturing (likable) pays a steep price. Gillibrand, chose to take a soft approach by wearing dresses in contrast to the suits (with pants) that many female candidates wear. Yet beyond optics, she took on issues more overtly women-focused than those of her competitors.

And Harris. Did her strong show of boldness, as when she confronted Vice President Biden on race, make her unlikeable? Why was she, like Gillibrand, unsuccessful in garnering support? Beyond garden-variety campaign problems, what unseen forces stood in the way? Harris wasn't simply a black candidate; our former president blazed that trail. She was a black woman.

As the campaign continued, Warren and Klobuchar established themselves as powerful, and presidential -- far more, surely, than most men in the race. Hence The New York Times endorsement of not one, but both. But by then Warren had fallen in the polls. Some questioned her ability to take on President Donald Trump, fueling doubt about her electability. In Nevada, Warren called attention to the no-win situation she faced as a female politician: ""If you complain about it, then you are whining,"" she said . ""And if you don't complain about it, the rest of the women think, 'what planet are you living on?' And so, you get caught in between the two.""

Klobuchar had taken the approach of emphasizing that she was running on her merits, not her gender -- though she would nonetheless be proud to be the first female president.

Unabashedly, she called out sexism when she commented during one debate, in reference to former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, that no female mayor of a small city would be in his position in the race.

Was that whining? Questions like this, even when uttered in a seemingly neutral context, are potentially toxic. Women must work doubly hard to not only be tough, but do it in a way that's visibly appealing.

Likeability may be why Warren, in an Instagram video , pulled a Michelob Ultra out of her fridge as she was casually talking in her kitchen.

The irony is, of course, that the most detestable president in memory resides in a White House defiled by corruption, deception, greed, amorality -- in desperate need of a woman to shovel it all out.

Yes, we're seeing progress below the presidential level. Women make up about a quarter of the voting body of the 116th Congress, a record number (although the women in both chambers are predominantly Democrats).

Given that 100 long years ago American women gained the right to vote, it's hard for many of us to fathom the fact we have yet to take our seat behind the desk in the Oval Office. Perhaps in 2020 we'll see a woman vice president. That would be progress, but not the progress the nation needs for truly representative democracy.

In her book ""What Happened,"" Hillary Clinton recounts an apt story that David Foster Wallace told at a 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College. Two young fish are swimming along when an older fish coming toward them nods and says, ""Mornin', boys. How's the water?"" The young fish blithely swim on. Eventually, one looks at the other: ""What's water?""

In fact, the most important realities can be the hardest for voters to see and talk about. But see and talk we must. Sexism was a force in this year's Democratic primary.

(CNN) The concerning scenario has played out in my office over and over again this season. ""Your child is due for the flu vaccine today"" is interrupted by, ""Oh, no, doctor -- we don't like to put unnecessary things in their body.""

The argument comes from parents who vaccinated their children against the flu at ages 1, 2, 3 and 4; parents of children who tolerated the vaccine well, who did not contract the flu, and yet at age 5 the flu shot suddenly became ""unnecessary."" I'm even hearing it from parents of siblings. For the child under age 5, parents agree to the flu shot; for the child over age 5, they decline it.

So, what changes at this magical age of 5? Schools in New York City, where I practice, stop requiring the flu shot . ""Not required"" has translated into ""not necessary.""

As dangerous as this misconception is, it's hard to blame parents when their reasoning is, after all, very logical: If the flu shot was truly necessary, wouldn't schools require it, like they require so many other childhood vaccinations? Not exactly.

In the United States, vaccine requirement laws are set by each state . Currently only a handful of states, New York included, require children to be vaccinated against the flu to enter daycare or pre-K. It is therefore not surprising that when researchers recently looked at the number of daycare centers around the country that required children to be vaccinated against the flu, they found only 24.5% did so. And once children turn 5, right as they enter elementary school, the flu shot requirement in these handful of states goes away altogether.",Do I need a flu shot?,"""Your child is due for the flu vaccine today"" is interrupted by, ""Oh, no, doctor -- we don't like to put unnecessary things in their body.""
The argument comes from parents who vaccinated their children against the flu at ages 1, 2, 3 and 4; parents of children who tolerated the vaccine well, who did not contract the flu, and yet at age 5 the flu shot suddenly became ""unnecessary.""
For the child under age 5, parents agree to the flu shot; for the child over age 5, they decline it.

733,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/11/asia/coronavirus-covid-19-update-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) The number of people infected with the novel coronavirus has surpassed 115,000, with the death toll reaching more than 4,200, as countries around the world continue to grapple with the challenges of containing the pandemic.

On Wednesday, China reported a slight increase in new daily cases, overturning several consecutive days of fewer new infections. The rise, from 19 on Monday to 24 on Tuesday, has been attributed to individuals returning from overseas, underscoring the difficulties faced by governments as the virus continues to spread rapidly across multiple continents.

Neighboring Japan and South Korea also saw an uptick in numbers Tuesday, with Japan reporting 54 more cases -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.

Authorities in South Korea, meanwhile, confirmed 242 new cases, bringing the national total to 7,755.

As with China, the infection rate in South Korea had slowed in recent days, bringing hope that the situation was beginning to stabilize. Though one of the world's worst hit countries, South Korea has been lauded for its widespread testing drive, which has so far seen around 200,000 people screened for the virus. However, new outbreaks linked to a call center in Seoul and the country's military are likely to alarm officials.

Western countries are also struggling with their own worsening outbreaks. The number of cases in the US has now reached at least 1,000, with numerous states declaring emergencies.

In Europe, cases have now been confirmed in every member nation of the European Union. Italy remains on total lockdown as its healthcare system struggles to cope, while nearby countries like Germany and France report alarming spikes in daily cases.

In a speech earlier this week, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated that different countries are facing ""different scenarios,"" with each requiring a tailored response. ""It's not about containment or mitigation -- which is a false dichotomy. It's about both,"" said Tedros.

Hubei aims to get back to business

China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, will allow businesses to gradually come back online and will resume some public transportation services, the provincial government said in a statement Wednesday.

Checkpoints will continue to be set up to screen anyone who wishes to enter or leave Hubei, while the government will also assist workers to return to their workplaces. Schools across the province will continue to be suspended until further notice, it added.

The decision comes as the number of cases in the province has declined significantly. Hubei was reporting thousands of infections a day just weeks ago. There were only 14 new infections reported in Hubei Tuesday, according to China's National Health Commission.

During a visit to Hubei's capital Wuhan on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that the country's control efforts had ""turned the tide."" Of the 80,778 people to have contacted the virus inside mainland China since the outbreak was first identified in December, 61,475 have recovered, according to the country's National Health Commission.

Japan sees a jump in cases

Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared to neighboring South Korea and China, however, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.

Japan now has 1,264 confirmed cases and 19 deaths. A total of 568 of the confirmed cases are on land and the remaining 696 cases are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

""In the past couple of days, for more than one week, we have been seeing an increase,"" said Yasuyuki Sahara, Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Health, on Tuesday night at a news conference.

Sahara cautioned that it was not yet ""an explosive outbreak,"" with the next one or two weeks likely to be crucial in the country's battle to contain the spread of the virus. ""That will determine whether there will be a rapid increase of spread, or whether the outbreak will be concluded,"" he added.

It's unclear whether the sudden spike in numbers is due to a genuine increase in infection, or whether it's due to factors like better detection.

Health experts in Japan have previously raised concerns over the country's approach to testing, which has seen only small numbers screened for the virus. Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the ""tip of the iceberg.""

If a bigger outbreak does arrive, it could serve a blow to the country's healthcare system. Sahara warned on Tuesday that hospitals are limited in capacity, and so the ministry is only encouraging those with severe symptoms to be tested.

Japan's outbreak, and the government's handling of it, has been under heightened scrutiny due to the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which organizers say are continuing as planned despite calls for cancellations.

In response to the outbreak, the country's cabinet has approved a bill that would enable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency. The draft bill, which would see the government given powers to to cancel public events and instruct people to stay indoors, is now heading to parliament, where it is expected to pass both chambers by Friday.

Italy is still under lockdown

The entire country of Italy was put under lockdown on Monday, extending drastic measures and restrictions that had previously only been in place in the north.

Since the outbreak arrived in Italy in late February, travelers have brought the virus from there to several European nations and to other regions of the world, including the US and Middle East.

Tuesday saw the biggest rise in coronavirus deaths since the outbreak began in the southern European nation. At least 168 people died in the past 24 hours, said Angelo Borrelli, head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency, on Tuesday.

That brings the national total to 10,149 cases and 631 deaths.

Italy's lockdown means residents' movements are restricted; military police, health officials, and other authorities are conducting checks at train stations, highways, and city roads to make sure people aren't traveling without permission. Schools are shut, public spaces like cinemas are closed, and typically bustling places like town squares are instead empty as people stay home.

Lydia Carelli, a 26-year-old intern at the Italian Supreme Court in Rome, told CNN: ""This is the strangest situation that I've ever lived, these restrictions are similar to times of war.""

The US reaches 1,000 cases

The situation appears to be worsening in the US , which reached 1,000 cases on Wednesday.

The number of patients identified has doubled since Sunday alone, indicating a dramatic exponential rise in infections. At least 31 people have died.

Washington state, where a nursing home in Kirkland was at the center of the outbreak, is still the hardest hit. California and New York aren't far behind, with more than 100 cases each, and Massachusetts is creeping toward the 100-case mark as well.

As these figures rise, communities are beginning to enact emergency measures. Numerous companies in virus-hit states are allowing employees to work from home; schools and universities are suspending classes, ending the semester early, or conducting online classes; states are declaring states of emergency, allowing them to access federal resources and funding; people are self-quarantining at home.

These measures echo the actions taken in countries across Asia just a month or two ago -- people in the US are even stocking up on face masks and hand sanitizer, reminiscent of the panic buying that swept Hong Kong in February.

But there are also drastic differences; countries like South Korea have rolled out widespread, aggressive testing, running thousands of tests every day. About one out of 250 people in South Korea have already been tested, said the vice minister of foreign affairs on Monday.

By comparison, the US -- with a population six times that of South Korea -- has only run about 3,700 tests in the federal CDC lab, and 4,800 in local public health labs across the country, according to the CDC.

But there could be confusion around these numbers, too -- Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday his department does not know exactly how many Americans have been tested.

""We don't know exactly how many, because hundreds of thousands of our tests have gone out to private labs and hospitals that currently do not report in"" to the CDC, Azar told CNN.","Coronavirus outbreak worsens in Italy and Japan, as situation stabilizes in China","Authorities in South Korea, meanwhile, confirmed 242 new cases, bringing the national total to 7,755.

401,https://us.cnn.com/style/article/corita-kent-nun-pop-art/index.html,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

At the end of the turbulent 1960s, the United States became enamored with Corita Kent, a nun who made joyous, politically charged and boldly colorful screen prints.

Featured on the cover of Newsweek in 1967 under the headline ""The nun: Going modern,"" she symbolized an evolving and more liberal Catholic Church. When she designed a stamp in 1985, the US Postal Service sold over 700 million of them.

""A lot of her works are about hope, and justice and love,"" said Nellie Scott, director of LA's Corita Art Center , which was set up after Kent's death to promote and preserve her legacy.

After Kent's death in 1986, her popularity steadily declined. That changed in 2007, when artist and curator Julie Ault reignited scholarly interest in her punchy, text-driven silk screens through the book ""Come Alive! The Spirited Art of Sister Corita.""

Like many other women artists , Kent's place in art history has been more thoroughly revisited through major exhibitions during the last decade, and her work is held in the collections of institutions including the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Last year, city authorities in Los Angeles, where she dedicated much of her life to teaching, named November 20 ""Corita Kent Day"" to mark what would have been her 101st birthday.

Most importantly, Kent has finally been credited for her contributions to Pop Art, a movement that male artists have long had a stronghold on.

""Not only were women discounted as producers of Pop, they were often hypersexualized as the represented objects of Pop Art,"" wrote curator Susan Dackerman in ""Corita Kent and the Language of Pop,"" a 2015 book accompanying an exhibition of the same name. Andy Warhol , for instance, was known for using stars like Marilyn Monroe and Edie Sedgwick as his muses and objects of desire.

Kent's long-standing comparisons to Warhol can be traced back to a formative moment in 1962, when she saw his career-launching series of 32 Campbell's soup cans at Ferus Gallery in New York.

She began thinking about consumerism, branding and text, and how to incorporate them into her practice, which was largely figurative and spiritual. Yet she had been prescient in her approach: Believing in accessible art, she adopted silk-screening around a decade before Warhol popularized the medium.

""How do you get your message (...) into the world as fast as possible?"" Scott asked.

""(Printmaking) is really democratic. It's something that can be done fairly quickly, and you're able to put out multiples in the world.""

Born as Frances Elizabeth Kent in 1918, her creative spirit was encouraged by her father from a young age. She joined the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary aged 18, taking the name Mary Corita Kent. After earning degrees at what is now the California Institute of the Arts and the University of Southern California, she taught art at the Immaculate Heart College, and eventually became department head.

Kent was said to be an enthusiastic educator who demanded polished techniques from her students, though she did so using easy and approachable tools. She could often be found teaching on the streets of Los Angeles, her students armed with white cardstock that they cut holes into to form makeshift viewfinders.

With the world reduced to specific textures, colors and patterns, viewed through the cards' 1-inch by 1-inch cut-outs, she taught them to see their surroundings differently.

In the set of 10 rules that Kent made for art and life, number four guided her own practice and her teachings: ""Consider everything an experiment.""

Kent's own artistic progression began with layered, colorful compositions featuring biblical motifs and eventually evolved to incorporate typography and wordplay, including poetry, religious texts and protest slogans. After seeing the aforementioned Warhol show, she looked to mass media and pop culture, using Wonder Bread's branding to represent the holy body of Christ, or the General Mills logo as ""the big G,"" with theistic implications.

How do you fall in love with art?

She also grappled with racism and war. In 1965, following the Watts race riots in Los Angeles, Kent made ""My people,"" which combined front-page news of the deaths from the uprising with writings from Father Maurice Ouellet, a white Catholic priest and civil rights activist who demonstrated in Selma, Alabama.

""I think that's where you see her really look at what's happening in the world,"" Scott said. Two years later, Kent's red, white and blue plea ""stop the bombing,"" against American involvement in the Vietnam War, began appearing at anti-war demonstrations.

Though Pope John XXIII had begun radically modernizing the Catholic Church in the 1960s, and Kent's own progressive sect enthusiastically embraced change, she still faced pushback for her work. The Archbishop of Los Angeles at the time, Cardinal James McIntyre, was a staunchly traditional thorn in her side, and became incensed over her 1964 print that declared: ""Mary Mother is the juiciest tomato of them all"" -- a reference to Del Monte's tomato sauce slogan.

Kent ultimately left the church in 1968, with her entire order later following suit to become a nondenominational congregation. With Boston as her new home, her work became more secular.

In 1969, she produced the series ""Heroes + Sheroes,"" which asked critical questions such as, ""Why not give a damn about your fellow man?"" as well as more optimistic declarations like, ""Hope arouses as nothing else can arouse a passion for the possible.""

The 1964 print ""The Juiciest Tomato of All,"" proved controversial with some members of the Church. Credit: Corita Art Center/Immaculate Heart Community

""Thinking through the work that she made after she left and spent the rest of her life in a more secular environment, (I think) that was ready to bubble out of her,"" Scott said of Kent's political works. ""And that was probably something that she would not have been able to do while she was in habit.""

When Kent died in 1986, following three bouts of cancer, she left the majority of her estate to the Immaculate Heart Community, which founded the Corita Art Center 11 years later.

Today, the center is planning an expanded facility to preserve and exhibit her art, and to introduce more people to her legacy: joyful, optimistic works that still ask difficult and necessary questions about human nature.

""It's really hard not to be disheartened in the current climate, and then I'll come to work and it will be whatever piece (of hers) I needed that day, or whatever quote,"" Scott said. ""I think that there is something about her message and her stirring of hope that people really resonate with. It's something that they're searching for, and I think we've had a swell of people wanting to experience it.""","The Catholic nun who made joyous, politically charged Pop Art","Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNNAt the end of the turbulent 1960s, the United States became enamored with Corita Kent, a nun who made joyous, politically charged and boldly colorful screen prints.

717,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/coalition-airstrikes-retaliation-iraq/index.html,"(CNN) The US carried out airstrikes on Thursday against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq, according to the US Defense Department.

The strikes come one day after the US assessed an Iranian-backed group was responsible for a rocket attack on a base where coalition forces are located, killing two American service members and one British service member.

The Defense Department on Friday identified the two US service members killed in the attack as Army Specialist Juan Miguel Mendez Covarrubias, 27, of Hanford, California and Air Force Staff Sgt. Marshal D. Roberts, 28, of Owasso, Oklahoma. The UK Ministry of Defense had earlier identified the slain UK service member as Lance Corporal Brodie Gillon.

The UK government expressed support for the US airstrikes, with the UK's Defense Secretary Ben Wallace saying ""We support the right of the United States to defend themselves, as they have done tonight.""

A US defense official told CNN that the strikes were carried out by manned fighter aircraft and targeted five weapons storage facilities.

In a written statement, the Defense Department stated the strike was aimed at harming the ability of Kata'ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored Shia militia group, to conduct future strikes against American troops. The weapons storage facilities included areas where weapons used to attack American and coalition troops were stored.

""These strikes were defensive, proportional, and in direct response to the threat posed by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups (SMG) who continue to attack bases hosting OIR coalition forces,"" the department statement read.

The statement added, ""These terror groups must cease their attacks on U.S. and coalition forces or face consequences at a time and place of our choosing. The US and the coalition remain committed to the lasting defeat of ISIS, and the long-term security, stability, and sovereignty of Iraq.""

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command which oversees US forces in the Middle East, told reporters Friday that the strikes had targeted storage sites housing ""advanced conventional weapons"" that he said had been provided to the militias by Iran, such as the 107mm rockets which were used in the deadly attack on Wednesday.

""We are confident that we have effectively destroyed these facilities and expect they will not longer be able to house the type of advanced Iranian-supplied weapons that were used in the Khatib Hezbollah attacks on the Iraqi base at Camp Taji,"" McKenzie said.

US Central Command also released images purporting to be the weapons storage facility targets hit in the airstrikes that took place near Baghdad.

The Iraqi government condemned the airstrikes in a statement Friday, saying that several Iraqi security force personnel were killed or wounded in the strikes.

Khatib Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia the US says was responsible for Wednesday's attack, is ostensibly part of the Iraqi security forces.

""These locations that we struck are clear locations of terrorist bases,"" McKenzie said Friday when asked about Iraq's opposition to the strike.

""If Iraqi military forces are there, I would say it's probably not a good idea to position yourself with Khatib Hezbollah in the wake of a strike that killed Americans and Coalition members,"" he added.

Tension with Iran

The strikes come months after the US and Iran were brought to the brink of war in early January. While the situation appeared to deescalate in the weeks following Iran's retaliatory strike on a base housing US troops in Iraq, tensions have flared up once again between Tehran and Washington.

There have been multiple rocket attacks in Iraq in recent weeks, but Wednesday's was the first to cause a US death since December, when a US contractor was killed. That death prompted retaliatory US airstrikes against Iranian-backed militia targets in Iraq and Syria. Trump administration officials pointed to the contractor's death as their justification for air strikes that killed Iran's second most powerful leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

The US was reviewing options as to how to respond, the US Defense secretary and top US general said earlier on Thursday.

""Yesterday's attack by Iranian backed Shia militia groups consisted of multiple indirect fires that originated from a stationary platform and was clearly targeting coalition and partner forces on Camp Taji,"" Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon while pledging that the US would take action to hold the attackers accountable.

""We're going to take this one step at a time. But we've got to hold the perpetrators accountable. You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it,"" Esper said.

President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he had been working on what to do about the attack on Wednesday night.

""They've sent a lot of rockets now. It hasn't been fully determined it was Iran,"" Trump said.

He added, ""It was a rebel group, but most likely it looks like it could be backed by Iran.""

Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the truck that fired the approximately 30 107mm rockets was captured by the Iraqi Security Forces and that forensics from that vehicle helped identify the attackers.

""We have pretty good confidence who did this. We were able to capture the truck, it was a modified truck with tubes, rocket tubes on the back, the Iraqi security forces did a good job in helping secure that truck. We have good indications based on forensics where it was fired from, who did the firing and so on and so forth,"" Milley said.

Milley said that 14 coalition personnel were also wounded in the attack, including five injuries that were considered ""urgent."" Those wounded included US, British, Polish and contractor personnel.

""The groups responsible will be held accountable appropriately,"" Milley said, adding, ""it was a significant attack and it resulted in the death and wounding of American (service members). So where we go from here as you would expect options are on the table and we are looking at everything and we will await final options and decisions from the President.""

Coronavirus effect

The series of strikes come as both Iran and the US struggle to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

McKenzie said Thursday he thinks the coronavirus outbreak in Iran ""is having an effect on how they make decisions,"" and that ""their inability to effectively respond to the coronavirus is I think inducing pressure on and inside the leadership.""

McKenzie said he thinks the coronavirus outbreak in Iran ""is having an effect on how they make decisions,"" and that ""their inability to effectively respond to the coronavirus is I think inducing pressure on and inside the leadership.""

""I think it probably makes them, in terms of decision making, more dangerous rather than less dangerous. But that's just my assessment,"" said McKenzie, adding that he believes ""the numbers are probably significantly underreported in terms of coronavirus victims in Iran.""

Asked why the Iranian groups chose to attack now, Milley said, ""There could be a lot of reasons, it could be coronavirus, it could be rogue Shia militia groups, it could be Soleimani's birthday, it could be a lot of things.""

McKenzie on Thursday said the outbreak was also ""going to have some effect on the military instrument"" when asked about the Iranian regular military and IRGC at a Senate Armed Services hearing.

The coalition strikes come one day after the House of Representatives approved a War Powers resolution aiming to rein in presidential authority to use military action against Iran without congressional approval.

The resolution -- introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat -- passed the Senate last month with bipartisan support despite Trump's vocal opposition.

It will now be sent to the White House, where Trump is expected to veto it. Congress is not expected to have enough votes to override a presidential veto. Although it is unlikely to become law, passage of the resolution by both chambers represents a significant rebuke to the President and highlights congressional support for efforts to check the executive branch's war-making powers.

Fundamentally about a pair of brothers dealing with lingering grief over the loss of their dad, the film adds a magical wrinkle to the premise by setting the story in a mythical world filled with elves, centaurs and pixies -- one where modern wonders and mechanization evolved very much along the lines of our own.

But something goes wrong (or there wouldn't be enough material for a movie), leaving dad reconstituted only from the waist down, as the two embark on a desperate mission to find the magical object that will allow them to complete the spell in time.

In a Marvel-ous pairing, Ian and Barley are voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, respectively, and they bring a goofy chemistry to their interaction, with the level-headed younger brother forced to ground the free-spirited older one.

Here's the kicker -- you're not even seated.

1204,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51833073,"Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption Soldiers have taken over key installations in the capital

For a day recently, the small West African country of Guinea-Bissau had two presidents and two prime ministers, until one of the presidents stepped down citing death threats.

The country has been gripped by political turmoil for so many years that analysts do not agree on exactly how many coups it has had in its 46 years of independence. Some say nine, others count 10. An election held last year was another attempt to carve a new peaceful path but it has sparked yet more chaos, as journalist Ricci Shryock reports.

Amidst the political chaos, daily life appears to be carrying on as normal in the capital, Bissau, but underneath the veneer, residents say they are deeply frustrated with the political chaos and confused about what will happen next and whom to believe.

While the Portuguese word ""saudades"" expresses a longing for the past, the feeling in Bissau is more akin to a longing for a more prosperous future they know is possible, but each time Bissau-Guineans' raise their hopes, they are dashed by political manoeuvring - often backed by guns.

Along the streets, women are selling the country's number-one cash crop - freshly harvested cashews.

But the presence of armed soldiers is a reminder that things are not normal.

The absence of trusted sources of news has provided good fodder for rumours and innuendo, with people constantly trying to parse what is true and what is not.

Contradictory official communiquÃÂ©s and letters from various sides, about who is the rightful president, are being shared on WhatsApp and Facebook in the country of 1.6 million people.

AFP Five things about Guinea-Bissau Population: 1.6 million

""We don't know what's going on,"" said a hotel manager, Aboubacar, as he scrolled through his Facebook feed. He furrowed his brow and frowned as he tried to decide which local blogs to read.

One restaurant owner, who said the chaos was hurting her business, added: ""For such a tiny country, it's amazing how much fake news we can produce.""

Umaro Cissoko EmbalÃÂ³ was announced as the winner of December's election.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Umaro Sissoco EmbalÃÂ³ has won two legal challenges and hopes to win a third

The long-time ruling party PAIGC however alleged it was cheated out of victory and insists that Mr EmbalÃÂ³ waits for the Supreme Court to rule on its third request to annul the elections. But he refused and has taken the oath of office.

And in the meantime, PAIGC lawmakers, who say that an alliance with smaller parties means they still have a majority in parliament, swore in one of its members as president and insisted their current prime minister stay in office.

However, shortly afterwards PAIGC Cipriano CassamÃÂ¡ stood down, citing fears for his safety.

Fake news fills the vacuum

""The problems in Bissau are structural problems, and the country has never really stabilised politically,"" said Gilles Yabi, founder of West African think-tank, Wathi.

""The country has the history of war, fighting for independence from Portugal, so the presence of the military is directly linked to this history, and the role the military played to get independence.""

Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption An uneasy calm has engulfed the streets of Bissau

He added there were other factors at play in the current crisis.

""The main problem is the political class of the country, and the fact that they have been fighting for power for a long time. The current situation is very polarised. Depending on whom you talk to, they will have quite a different version of things.""

There are two competing versions at the moment: While the PAIGC says the elections was rigged, the opposing side, MADEM-G15, says its candidate Mr EmbalÃÂ³ won December's polls and is now rightfully installed at the presidency.

Image copyright Dan Sanha Image caption Cipriano CassamÃÂ¡ was speaker of parliament until he briefly became president

The National Election Commission has repeatedly confirmed that Mr EmbalÃÂ³ won the polls with 54% of the vote, and at least one minister in his government has publicly accused their opponents of bribing a Supreme Court judge to rule in PAIGC's favour and stall the confirmation of Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s win.

Both sides say they have proof, but in the vacuum of that proof, residents' social media feeds are flooded with false news reports of weapons seizures at a political party's headquarters and politicians hiding out at foreign embassies - events that never happened.

Bissau and the cocaine trade

To add to the confusion, Guinea-Bissau has for many years been used as a staging post in the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America to Europe.

The PAIGC's Aristides Gomes, who still says he is the rightful prime minister, has claimed that narco-trafficking is the main factor behind the current political instability.

A brief history of Guinea-Bissau:

Image copyright AFP

1446-47: First Portuguese arrive; subsequently administered as part of the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, the Guinea area becomes important in the slave-trade. Guinea-Bissau becomes a separate colony in the Portuguese Empire in 1879.

1974: Independence following a guerrilla war.

1980: Country's first president, LuÃÂ­s Cabral, is ousted in military coup led by JoÃÂ£o Bernardo Vieira; plans for unification with Cape Verde dropped. The overthrow is the first of many political coups that undermine the country's stability over the next four decades.

2010: US names two top military officials as international drugs traffickers and freezes their US assets. EU announces it is ending mission to reform Guinea-Bissau's security forces, saying lack of respect for rule of law is making this an impossible task.

2011: EU suspends part of its aid to Guinea-Bissau because of concerns over governance and the rule of law. Several months later, thousands take to the streets to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Carlos Gomes JÃÂºnior for his failure to curb rising food prices.

2012: The UN Security Council expresses concern that drug trafficking has increased, and demands a return to constitutional rule.

2020: Umaro Cissoko EmbalÃÂ³ takes office

Experts say drug traffickers can profit from the current political chaos, and there were already reports that one notorious trafficker who had previously fled the country was spotted back in Bissau at a downtown hotel last week.

This report was denied by Ibrahima Jalo, an ally of Mr EmbalÃÂ³, who heads the association of 18 political parties which is not represented in the assembly.

""No, no, noÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Drug trafficking? In this country? No. Please. The drug trafficking here in Guinea-Bissau was maybe happening before, but it will never happen again.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Vultures are often seen as a portend of death in the region

In the past, the military and navy have been heavily linked to the country's drug trade.

In 2013, US Drug Enforcement Administration arrested the former head of the navy as he was attempting to close a million-dollar cocaine deal going through Guinea-Bissau.

Trafficking reportedly dropped off in Guinea-Bissau after that, but some experts say the recent few years of political crisis have reopened the corridor.

Amidst the chaos, nearly 1,000 hooded vultures were killed in a mass poisoning in the east of the country. Some said it was a bad omen for the country.

The birds were bubbling from their beaks in what the Vulture Conservation Foundation says is the worst mass vulture death event in recent memory in the world.

Fighting in the courts, not with guns

Vincent Foucher, a researcher for the French National Centre for Scientific Research, stresses that the latest iteration of the crisis appears at least for now to be more peaceful than some in the past.

""I think it's quite important to note that the elites have realised that now the competition is fought with and around legal norms. It's not about killing people - well for now - or coups. Let's hope it stays that way,"" he said.

However, all parties insist the law is on their side.

""It's always this thing that in Bissau people bend the law in one sense or another as suits their interests in the position of the moment. The law is bendable and it's not strong enough, not written clearly enough to an extent, and that's part of the problem even though it's not the cause of the problem,"" Mr Foucher added.

Foreign involvement is also complicating the situation.

Senegalese President Macky Sall has been outspoken in his support of Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s presidency and his Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam.

The PAIGC has, however, denounced Senegal for what it says is interference in Guinea-Bissau's internal politics and that it wants to control the country's development - or lack thereof - especially when it comes to contentious maritime rights along their shared border.

Regional body Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) has said Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s inauguration was outside the legal framework. A claim Mr EmbalÃÂ³'s supporters rejected.

Still dreaming of a better future

Meanwhile, young people in the country lament that the political crisis in the country has lasted their entire lives.

Teachers and healthcare workers have been on strike since late last year, and many in the capital express a desire for the international community to intervene.

Ecowas was scheduled to send a team of experts to mediate this week, but they cancelled their mission under pressure from Mr EmbalÃÂ³ 's government at the last minute.

The UN Security Council also late last week urged security and defence forces not to interfere with the post-electoral political crisis.

293,https://us.cnn.com/2015/11/02/us/fraternity-hazing-deaths/index.html,"(CNN) Nolan Burch 's parents didn't know what West Virginia University knew -- that the fraternity their son was pledging had a history of bad behavior and was about to lose its charter.

And Marquise Braham' s parents didn't know what they say Penn State University allegedly knew -- that there were concerns about their son's well-being in the days leading up to his suicide.

All three sets of parents now believe they were kept in the dark by institutions they trusted to care for their sons.

The Burch, Hipps and Braham families share a common sadness -- their sons are dead, lost to what they believe was hazing-related behavior. They're three of the more than two dozen students who have died because of hazing at U.S. colleges and universities since 2008.

Samuel Mason, 20, died in 2010. He was allegedly made to drink a bottle of liquor in an hour while pledging Tau Kappa Epsilon at Radford University in Virginia. Radford University says that chapter of TKE had been found in violation of university policy earlier that year for serving alcohol to minors at a fraternity social event. His family sued and settled with the national fraternity and several of the local chapter's members.

And, CNN has learned, through record requests and other sources, that in five hazing-related deaths in as many years, institutions knew there was trouble before the deadly incidents happened.

'Occurrences of concern'

Nowhere on West Virginia University's website did it say that Kappa Sigma fraternity had a history of, as the school now puts it, ""occurrences of concern"" -- specifically referring to the fraternity ""behaving inappropriately and hosting an unsanctioned event."" The fraternity was also warned about overcrowding in its off-campus residence.

Burch, a WVU freshman, died following a fraternity hazing event in November 2014. His blood alcohol content was measured at 0.493, more than six times the legal limit to drive. His death led to the suspension of all Greek activities at WVU and criminal charges against two Kappa Sigma brothers.

Two days before the event, where police say Burch and others were blindfolded and forced to drink liquor, the national office of Kappa Sigma notified WVU that it was pulling the charter of the local fraternity chapter. According to a statement given to CNN, the national office directed the local chapter to stop holding functions. But that directive was ignored, according to the fraternity's national office.

""They'd been in so much trouble they (the national office) put cameras in the fraternity house,"" Burch's mother, Kim Burch, told CNN. ""The frat actually installed cameras.""

CNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.

Kim and T.J. Burch say their 18-year-old son was not aware of the fraternity's troubles when he decided to pledge. No one told him, and no one told his parents either.

""We had no idea, unfortunately, until Nolan passed, that there had been so many problems,"" Kim Burch said. ""It's sad. It's really sad. If we had known this was going on, we would have never let him join this fraternity.""

'Unprecedented conduct issues'

That same semester, Tucker Hipps' family had no idea that Clemson University was having a serious problem with fraternities. The university was considering a moratorium on all fraternity events, but decided just three days before Hipps died to hold off.

It would later come out that Sigma Phi Epsilon violated five rules while Hipps was pledging, including violations related to hazing, harm to person, alcohol and organizational conduct. The university did not answer when asked by CNN if officials were aware of those five SigEp violations prior to Hipps' death.

Hipps, 19, died after he fell, jumped or was pushed off a bridge during a predawn run that was against the fraternity's hazing policy. There's an open criminal investigation and the family is suing the university and three fraternity members, who all have denied knowing how he died.

His parents say it was not for lack of trying that they did not know about the fraternity's problems.

Hipps' father, in particular, was opposed to his son joining a fraternity at Clemson.

""His dad was totally against it in the beginning,"" his mother said earlier this year. Cindy Hipps said she'd done her due diligence, even attending a Greek orientation meeting, which she said put her mind at ease.

""After that class I felt better about it,"" she said. ""They said kids in frats have better time management skills, set study times, did it as a group activity. Those kids had higher grade point averages. All the things a mother wants to hear, I heard. I convinced his dad to let him do it. Never once did I ever feel like my child would be harmed in any way.""

When she checked out Clemson's Greek life website, she saw only positive information, such as links to the average GPAs of each fraternity and sorority. There were two references to hazing policy, but nothing that explained which fraternities or sororities had been cited for violating those rules.

But at that time, Clemson officials were concerned about ""unprecedented conduct issues over the course of first 3 weeks of school,"" at several of the school's fraternities, according to internal documents obtained by CNN.

After Hipps' death, Clemson added a list of suspended fraternities to its website.

If Hipps' already-apprehensive parents had known what was going on at Clemson, they say, they would have pulled their son out of Greek life immediately.

Dangers are not myths

West Virginia University, Clemson and Penn State are not the only universities that brag about philanthropy, brotherhood and connections for life on their Greek life websites. Most schools list only the positives.

Clemson's says ""Greek organizations do hold social events, but most of these do not include alcohol.""

Penn State's goes as far as to say: ""For many parents, the fraternity and sorority community reminds them of images of the movie Animal House. There are many myths about the fraternity and sorority community, but the reality is that men and women in fraternities and sororities are committed to their academics, volunteer their time in the community, develop and strengthen their leadership skills, and form a campus network with other fraternity and sorority members.""

That kind of language outrages Doug Fierberg, an attorney for the Braham family, who recently sued Penn State on the family's behalf and who has handled dozens of university misconduct cases in his career.

""The dangers of fraternities are not myths. They are reality,"" Fierberg said. ""The failure by universities to tell the truth about the risks facing students in fraternities specifically related to hazing misuse and abuse of alcohol and other misconduct is the new battleground.""

""It needs to be changed nationally, because parents and students are entitled to timely and accurate information about the risks they face. And universities have no basis, morally or legally, to withhold that information from the university community,"" he said.

Some universities don't post a hazing policy on their Greek sites. For example, at West Virginia University, it's posted separately on the campus police site. (West Virginia University told CNN it is considering a number of changes, including ""better and more timely communication."")

Others have listed it in online FAQs, several clicks away from the positives.

There are very few universities that list fraternity infractions on their websites, and even when they do, it's often difficult to determine what the infractions really mean.

For example, after the 2008 alcohol poisoning death of Brett Griffin, 18, at the University of Delaware, Fierberg sued on behalf of the family and forced Delaware to change its Greek life site to list violations. But the list is vague , just listing things like ""multiple violations"" or ""social policy violations"" or ""hazing/alcohol"" without details of the incidents.

""You're looking at best practices,"" Fierberg said, referring to the University of Delaware site. ""What's 'multiple violations'? Were people hurt? Was a student hospitalized? What does it take to get suspended?""

Northern Illinois University adopted a policy of putting sanctions on its website after the 2012 death of David Bogenberger, a 19-year-old pledge who was forced to drink alcohol and died. (Twenty-two brothers from the Phi Kappa Alpha fraternity were criminally charged and sentenced to two years of court supervision, plus community service.) Three months after his death, NIU made the change, but the list isn't on the Greek life website -- and it's so hard to find, CNN had to ask the university to point out where it is. (It's on a separate page , one for the Office of Community Standards & Student Conduct.)

David Bogenberger

The relationship between universities and fraternities can be confusing, since many of them reside off-campus and are chartered by national organizations. But Fierberg said universities violate their duties to students and parents when they create websites about Greek life and only include feel-good information, instead of an accurate and complete picture.

And national fraternities are no better.

The only major fraternity that lists its violations is Sigma Alpha Epsilon, according to Fierberg, and that's because he sued SAE after the 2008 death of a fraternity pledge at California Polytechnic State University and forced it to list prior violations online.

Carson Starkey, 18, died of alcohol poisoning following an event where pledges were forced to drink alcohol, vomit, and drink some more. The SAE chapter at Cal Poly had a prior drug violation before the death, according to Cal Poly.

""(Universities) won't give you the full information because it will confirm that what you believe is right,"" Fierberg said. ""Of course you have a zero tolerance policy. (Hazing is) illegal. ... But why wouldn't you tell parents it's still going on?""

Fierberg said he suspects that the universities don't even write their own language for these Greek life information sites, since many of them look the same. In fact, a Google search of ""myth"" and ""Greek life"" and ""hazing"" and "".edu"" shows nearly identical definitions of hazing on the websites of dozens of schools.

Mental health emergencies

Marquise Braham jumped off the roof of a Marriott in Nassau County, New York, in March of 2014, the same year that Hipps and Burch died. A source close to the case says there was evidence of alcohol-fueled physical and sexual hazing prior to Braham's suicide.

Marquise Braham

Fierberg is representing Braham's family in its lawsuit against Penn State.

Fierberg claims the university was aware there were ""serious concerns"" about the ""well-being and psychological health"" of Braham, 18, in the days leading up to his suicide.

Phi Sigma Kappa told CNN it hasn't seen the lawsuit and will not comment.

The police chief in Logan Township, Pennsylvania, where the satellite campus he attended is located, told local reporters that Braham had discussed hazing at his fraternity with an aunt and with several friends. The case is under investigation by the state attorney general, but no charges have been filed. The fraternity was suspended. Penn State said it couldn't comment on Braham's death, because of his family's pending lawsuit, but admitted there are times when the university reaches out to parents to notify them of harmful situations.

""Emergency in this context includes mental health emergencies as well,"" university spokeswoman Lisa Powers said in an email. ""In general, and in accordance with privacy laws and practices, when we have a student emergency we balance the critical nature/seriousness of the situation with the student's privacy rights as we make the decision to contact parents, or not.""

Many universities say they alert parents of health risks, such as when a student contracts a contagious disease, but there is no such pattern of reporting when it comes to other potential threats, like hazing.

In addition to Hipps and Burch, there is the 2010 death of Samuel Mason, 20, who was allegedly made to drink a bottle of liquor in an hour while pledging Tau Kappa Epsilon at Radford University in Virginia. Radford University says that chapter of TKE had been found in violation of university policy earlier that year for serving alcohol to minors at a fraternity social event. His family sued and settled with the national fraternity and several of the local chapter's members.

And the death of Armando Villa, a 19-year-old at California State University-Northridge, pledging Pi Kappa Phi, who died during a hazing-related 18-mile August hike where, his family lawsuit alleges, he and other pledges weren't given enough water. His fraternity had been cited for not completing required education programs and for holding unregistered events, and had just been reinstated after a suspension when the hike took place. A spokesman for the family says his mother, Betty Serrato, didn't know about the suspension and says that if she had, she would have tried to talk her son out of pledging that fraternity.

Neither Radford or CSUN has sanctions posted on its website, although CSUN told CNN it is considering putting them online.

""It's sad. It's really sad,"" Kim Burch said. ""If we had known this was going on, we would have never let him join this fraternity. I never in my life thought I was sending a 17-year-old kid off to end up two months later gone. It's repulsive. He would have been better off joining the Marines and going to war.""",Schools knew of trouble before student deaths,"The Burch, Hipps and Braham families share a common sadness -- their sons are dead, lost to what they believe was hazing-related behavior.

492,https://us.cnn.com/travel/article/malta-mayor-pete-buttigieg-last-name/index.html,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Although American presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race this week, his hard-to-pronounce name has given US voters a lesson in phonetics.

While most US presidential candidates' pins and shirts bear names or slogans, Buttigieg's fans wore swag explaining the famously tricky pronunciation of his name. (Their shirts, pins and hats read ""Boot Edge Edge"" and ""Buddha Judge."")

Why was it so hard for Americans to sound out his name? One reason might be its origins. The name Buttigieg comes from Maltese, a language unlike any other on earth.

Related content How to pronounce Pete Buttigieg

""All languages draw from other languages,"" says Joseph Brincat, an expert in the history of the Maltese language and the author of ""Maltese and Other Languages: A Linguistic History of Malta.""

""Maltese draws not just from different languages but from three language families.""

The first of these language groups, Semitic, also includes Hebrew and Arabic. The other two, Romance and Germanic, are part of the large Indo-European language family. (French and Italian are both Romance languages; English, Dutch and Icelandic are all Germanic languages with a common ancestor.)

And while Maltese is considered a dialect of Arabic, Arabic speakers in nearby Tunisia and Libya can understand only 40% of spoken Maltese.

The written version, moreover, would be nearly impossible to parse. Dozens of Semitic languages are spoken across the Middle East and Africa, and they're written in scripts that range from the Hebrew alphabet to the rounded Ge'ez script used in Ethiopia. Alone among Semitic languages, Maltese is written in the Latin script employed by English and many other European languages.

How did this unique dialect of Arabic land on a Mediterranean island? During the Muslim conquest of the Mediterranean world starting in the 7th century AD, the language spread along with eastern technologies, ideas and foods.

Arabs arriving from Sicily invaded Malta in 870, deposing then-Byzantine rulers and seizing power for the next 200 years. While it's unknown exactly when Arabic took root in the islands, linguists believe modern-day Maltese is descended from a dialect of Arabic spoken in the Middle Ages.

The Midpoint of the Mediterranean

Surrounded by powdery beaches and rock formations, the country of Malta is an archipelago just south of Sicily, with three main islands that make up just 122 square miles.

Closer to the African cities of Tunis and Tripoli than it is to Rome, Malta is often called the midpoint of the Mediterranean, and for the seafaring powers that once grappled for power here that strategic location made the islands a sought-after prize.

A who's-who of conquerors in Malta would range from the ancient Romans to Napoleon, the Byzantines to the British. That history transformed the island's Mediterranean Arabic into something uniquely Maltese, a language imprinted by centuries of outside influence.

Now, says Brincat, more than half the vocabulary comes from Sicilian or Italian, with just a third reflecting the original Arabic. Malta was also part of the British Empire for more than 150 years, and some 8% of modern Maltese is drawn from English.

With such diverse influences, Maltese can be a mouthful. From a pronunciation perspective, however, the name Buttigieg is pretty basic.

(As an example of a more challenging word, the Professor proposed ÃÂ¦an GÃÂargÃÂur, a hilltop village whose name Brincat pronounced with a deft, throaty trill that sounds something like: ha ra raow.

A convergence of cultures

It's not just the language. The same power struggles that shaped Maltese are written in stone throughout the islands.

Visitors can explore that history in the capital city of Valletta, a World Heritage Site that UNESCO describes as ""one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world.""

Among the city's highlights is St. John's Co-Cathedral, a masterpiece of Baroque artwork and architecture. (A co-cathedral shares a bishop's seat with another church; in Malta, the main seat of the archdiocese is St. Paul's Cathedral in Mdina.)

Even the floor is exquisite. The co-cathedral's sanctuary is paved in brilliant-colored marble marking nearly 400 tombstones of Knights of Saint John, a religious order that founded Valletta and became militarized during the First Crusade to Jerusalem.

Just across the water from Valletta is Fort St. Angelo, which become a strategic stronghold for the Knights of Saint John when Ottoman troops laid siege to the island in 1565 for more than three months.

It was a particularly bloody episode in the running contest for power and faith in the Mediterranean, and it riveted Europe. ""If the Turks should prevail against the Isle of Malta,"" said England's Queen Elizabeth I, ""it is uncertain what further peril might follow to the rest of Christendom.""

In one grisly confrontation, the Ottoman army floated the headless bodies of Christian knights into Valletta's Grand Harbour in an attempt to demoralize enemy forces. Local Christians, in turn, decapitated Ottoman prisoners and loaded their heads into the cannons of Fort St. Angelo.

Today, a public holiday called Victory Day commemorates September 8th, 1565, when Ottoman invaders drew back, forever ending Malta's role in the struggle between Muslim and Christian forces.

Malta's ancient mysteries

Gozo's Ggantija Temples are older than the pyramids of Egypt. Courtesy of the Malta Tourism Authority

That culture war is hundreds of years in the past, but compared to Malta's most ancient sites, the conflict between the Christian and Muslim worlds in this majority-Catholic country seems like recent history.

Built across the islands of Malta and Gozo are seven megalithic temples that are some of the oldest free-standing stone buildings on earth.

The temples, which together form a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are a mysterious window into the Bronze Age.

Step into the hilltop site of ÃÂ¦aÃÂ¡ar Qim, a temple built between 3200 and 3600 BC, and you'll enter a world aligned to the heavens. A chamber here is carved to admit a warm beam of sunshine on the summer solstice.

In the megalithic temples, bas-reliefs show images of the natural world, including plants, animals and trees. Within the temples, archeologists have found statues depicting corpulent women (PDF) , and some have speculated that the islands were a site of fertility- and goddess-worship.

Much about the ancient people who built these temples remain a mystery.

Linguists don't know what language was spoken here when megalithic temples were constructed across Malta in the 3rd and 4th millennia BC. Thousands of years after islanders erected sanctuaries honoring natural cycles, even their simplest words are lost to history.

The Buttigieg effect?

Battery Street is one of many narrow streets in the capital city of Valletta. Courtesy of the Malta Tourism Authority

Today, the ancient Maltese can speak only through their stones. Modern Maltese people, however, have the ""Times of Malta,"" the country's most widely circulated paper.

The newspaper covered the Buttigieg primary campaign long before the former mayor of South Bend collected delegates in Iowa and New Hampshire. Language is front and center. One story described Buttigieg's own uphill efforts to explain the pronunciation of his name, which can be roughly translated to ""lord of the poultry.""

And recent coverage points to the benefits for Maltese-Americans of the ongoing conversations about their ancestral language. ""Malta has been living under the radar for so long,"" Maltese-American Joe Gauci told ""Times of Malta"" journalist Vanessa Conneely. ""People are discovering our diamond in the Mediterranean Sea.""

Some Maltese-Americans understood the candidate's struggles all too well. ""Growing up with the name Buttigieg was interesting,"" Michigan resident Lisa Buttigieg-LiGreci explained to Conneely. ""No one ever heard of it or could pronounce it.""

Conneely pointed to ""The Buttigieg Effect"" as a chance for Americans to finally learn the basics of Maltese. But even among the relatively small demographic of Maltese-Americans named ""Buttigieg,"" however, consensus is still hard to reach during the campaign. Lisa Buttigieg-LiGreci, for one, didn't approve of Mayor Pete's pronunciation of his own name.",A bipartisan Buttigieg effect?

913,https://us.cnn.com/2017/04/19/opinions/human-rights-cycle-violence-nikki-haley/index.html,"Story highlights Nikki Haley: Widespread human rights violations a warning sign that breakdown in security is coming

Syrian war just one example of how such violations can spiral into all-out war, she says

Ambassador Nikki R. Haley is the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) Imagine you are the parent of a boy -- a teenager. Policemen come to your home in the middle of the night and take your boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.

For a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents marched in protest to demand their children's release, security services opened fire on them. When more people came out to protest the killings, the government fired on them again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.

Nikki Haley

""We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children but their reply was bullets,"" a relative of one of the boys told a reporter . ""Now we can have no compromise with any security branches.""

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

For an artist who deals in ephemera, Olafur Eliasson likes to take the long view. Outside the gallery, he fears humanity is transfixed on now at the expense of tomorrow -- and warns that obsession could be at the expense of the planet.

Eliasson has returned to London for what he calls his ""mid-career survey,"" assembling three decades of work, some new, in the Tate Modern for exhibition ""In Real Life."" It marks a spiritual return to the gallery that hosted what is perhaps still his crowning achievement, 2003's Turbine Hall installation ""The Weather Project.""

From suspended water droplets to restless light shows, the Icelandic-Danish artist has always placed transience at the heart of his elemental work. He bottles lightning, so to speak, so that we may appreciate its delicate majesty. And the delicacy of nature is coming into even sharper focus as the years pass.

An artist who says he's interested in the environment, rather than an environmental artist, visitors will see gathering momentum on the subject of climate change throughout his career. No more explicitly is this made than in ""Ice Watch,"" a glacial henge made of icebergs from Greenland, first created in 2014 and reprised in London in the lead up to his current show.

""Ice Watch"" (2018) by Olafur Eliasson and Minik Rosing. Credit: Charlie Forgham-Bailey

As our institutions drag their heels and reform is slow, he believes art has a crucial role to play in the public discourse.

""Politicians are getting increasingly obsessed with the immediate,"" he says. ""(Solutions to climate change) require long-term decisions, long-term investment, long-term planning. We need to see accountability by politicians, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years (into the future), long after the politician's dead and gone.""

He believes we have been let down by politicians and the private sector. ""I'm afraid we can't wait for them to do the work for us. Because they are not going fast enough,"" he argues. Civic society holds the answers, Eliasson suggests, and art can act as a great communicator within it.

""We get a lot of science ... but it's fair to say that it's often very disembodied,"" he explains. ""It is knowledge that doesn't have a physical sort of storage; there's no memory (of it) in our bodies... One of the things that art can do -- and it's not the only thing -- is it can sort of bring a physical narrative to something that one knows.""

A new work, ""The presence of absence pavilion,"" conveys one such narrative. A cast bronze sculpture molded around the negative space of glacial ice, it's a permanent memorial to a loss we seem incapable of stopping.

""I think we have a better ability to translate our critical enquiry into action once we have a physical relationship with the world,"" he says. ""Bringing an experiential narrative to knowledge ... gives you a certain empowerment.""

""We have a situation now where the whole planet has become conscious about (climate change). I think we see a trend how to translate our climate knowledge into climate actions. I hope it's the beginning we are seeing, and not the peak,"" Eliasson adds.

Art's slow churn is part of the medium's appeal for Eliasson. ""Sometimes the idea of a work of art is 10 years in the making, and it's 10 years in the arriving, and 10 years in the responding,"" he says, referring to no work in particular.

His big idea for the economy is a complete payroll tax holiday. According to Bloomberg News, he told Republican senators that he wanted the holiday to extend Ã¢ÂÂthrough the November election so that taxes donÃ¢ÂÂt go back up before voters decide whether to return him to office.Ã¢ÂÂ That is, he apparently said the quiet part out loud.

This would be an enormous move. Payroll taxes are 5.9 percent of G.D.P.; by comparison, the Obama stimulus of 2009-2010 peaked at about 2.5 percent of G.D.P. Yet it would be very poorly targeted: big breaks for well-paid workers, nothing for the unemployed or those without paid sick leave.

Why do it this way? After all, if the goal is to put money in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs hands, why not just send out checks? Apparently Republicans canÃ¢ÂÂt conceive of an economic policy that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt take the form of tax cuts.

Trump also reportedly wants to provide aid to specific industries, including oil and shale Ã¢ÂÂ a continuation of his administrationÃ¢ÂÂs efforts to subsidize fossil fuels.

Democrats, by contrast, have proposed a package that would actually address the needs of the moment: free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, expanded unemployment benefits and an increase in federal matching funds for Medicaid programs, which would both help states meet the demands of the crisis and sustain overall spending by relieving the pressure on state budgets.

Notice, by the way, that these measures would help the economy in an election year, and therefore arguably help Trump politically. But Democrats are willing to do the right thing anyway Ã¢ÂÂ a stark contrast to the behavior of Republicans after the 2008 financial crisis, when they offered scorched-earth opposition to anything that might mitigate the damage.",Opinion | ItÃ¢ÂÂs a MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"And when it comes to the economy, Trump seems to fluctuate day to day Ã¢ÂÂ even hour to hour Ã¢ÂÂ between assertions that everything is fine and demands for enormous, ill-conceived stimulus.

726,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/trump-test-coronavirus/index.html,"(CNN) This is a fact: Over the weekend, at Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump came into contact with a Brazilian press aide who was diagnosed Thursday with coronavirus.

Which leads us to another fact: The President of the United States has been exposed to coronavirus.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

Despite that indisputable reality, Trump has so far refused to be tested for the virus. Asked about the press aide's positive test on Thursday, Trump responded this way: ""Let's put it this way, I'm not concerned, OK?""

That's consistent with his reaction when informed that Reps. Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida had both interacted with a person who had tested positive for coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Committee.

""I don't think it's a big deal, I would do it, I don't feel any reason -- I feel extremely good,"" said Trump , adding he had ""no symptoms, no anything.""

That is a deeply irresponsible view for anyone -- much less the President of the United States -- to take.

(Side note: It also appears to be untrue. ""He is very concerned about all the people he met who have it, including the Brazilian,"" a source close to the President told CNN's Jim Acosta .)

Here's why: Trump is a 73-year-old man who we KNOW has been exposed to the virus. People who have coronavirus can be asymptomatic for days or even weeks -- and by continuing to carry on your normal daily life, you run the risk of infecting lots and lots of people if you do, in fact, have the virus.

What the country is currently in the process of is an attempt to ""flatten the curve"" on the infection rate, working to slow down the rate of spread in order to ensure that the medical community can keep up with the number of people who are sick, and ensure proper care for each and every one of them.

That's why schools are closed. The NBA is shuttered. And Broadway is dark. In order to contain this outbreak, we all have to adjust the ways in which we are used to living. That includes making sure that we are good members of the community -- and not accidentally spreading this virus to others, especially the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.

Leaders should know that. Leaders need to model the behavior -- even if it is uncomfortable -- that they need from the public. Leaders need to be the best of us.

At the moment, Trump is not doing that. He's doing the opposite. Given his documented exposure, it is absolutely reckless for him to continue his current, normal behavior without getting tested. On a daily basis, he is meeting with high-level officials across the government without knowing whether he is infecting them.

(It is, of course, possible that Trump has been tested and we haven't been told about it or the results aren't known yet. But that seems unlikely. And either way, medical recommendations would suggest he should be self-quarantining if he believes himself to have the virus.)

Geist: Just to piggyback on what Mika said, we know the President of the United States over the weekend at Mar-a-Lago himself was standing with and had physical contact with someone from Brazil who now has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Should the President himself be tested for coronavirus?

Fauci: I'd leave that to the President's physician. He -- they have a very good White House physician and physician staff there. So when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician.

Geist: But generally speaking if I were standing next to someone who had been diagnosed with coronavirus should I isolate myself and find a test as well?

Fauci: Yes.

So, yeah. Fauci is doing his best to avoid saying the President needs to be tested while also saying, effectively, the President needs to be tested.

The simple fact is this: It is crazy that Trump has seemingly not been tested for coronavirus. Absolutely crazy.",Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus,"Which leads us to another fact: The President of the United States has been exposed to coronavirus.

1043,https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/46-how-to-use-an-instant-pot,"How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?

Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.

A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers Ã¢ÂÂ stovetop and electric Ã¢ÂÂ are quite safe. They donÃ¢ÂÂt explode as your grandmotherÃ¢ÂÂs may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.

For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, theyÃ¢ÂÂre heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the potÃ¢ÂÂs temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isnÃ¢ÂÂt hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.

With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cookÃ¢ÂÂs having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And donÃ¢ÂÂt worry: It wonÃ¢ÂÂt explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.",How to Use an Instant Pot,"Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin.
Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils.
The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.
With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options.
As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure.","['temperature', 'degrees', 'cooker', 'steam', 'high', 'pot', 'pressure', 'cookers', 'instant', 'inside', 'liquid']",NYTimes

Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.

(CNN) Give Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this much: at least he's open and transparent about his plan to rig the upcoming Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. McConnell -- who will serve as both judge (in his capacity as majority leader to set the procedure before trial) and juror (as one of the 100 senators who will vote to convict or acquit Trump) -- came right out and said that he will work ""in total coordination with the White House counsel."" McConnell's disdain for even the appearance of a fair process is so pointed that it seems his end goal is to de-legitimize the upcoming trial before it begins.

McConnell is not the only future impeachment juror to have made rash statements about the upcoming trial. Senator Lindsey Graham, abandoning all pretext of impartiality, proudly declared that he's ""not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here."" And this tendency to pre-judge crosses party lines.

For example, Elizabeth Warren has stated that what Trump ""has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached.""

It is bad for the process when senators of either party publicly undermine their obligation to be impartial. But McConnell's conduct is worse than that. Each senator is one vote out of 100, but McConnell's pronouncement that he will totally coordinate with the White House is destructive to the underlying constitutional process we are about to see unfold.

An impeachment trial is different in many respects from a criminal trial, but the criminal process provides a useful point of reference. If a person in McConnell's position -- judge or juror -- tried to coordinate with a party to a criminal case, he would be thrown off the case, disciplined and potentially prosecuted for obstruction of justice. While this isn't a criminal case, McConnell's comments show his disregard for the weight of the moment.

It is hard to miss that McConnell's pronouncement comes with a note of glee. Far from being secretive or apologetic about his coordination with the White House, he has come right out and boasted about it. It seems his cynical bottom line goal is to de-legitimize the process -- to promote the broad public view that the Senate trial is not a meaningful truth-finding exercise but rather empty political theater. His remarks seem designed to elicit a dismayed shake of the head and then a ""what are you gonna do?"" shrug from the populace. McConnell likely will get what he wants -- a quick acquittal of Trump -- but only at the long-term cost of public confidence in the integrity of our political and legal processes.

Now, your questions

Vignesh (New Jersey): What is the significance of the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the cases relating to Trump's tax returns?

The Supreme Court last week granted certiorari (meaning, in plain English, it ""agreed to review"") Trump's efforts to block disclosure of his tax returns. The court consolidated three separate cases for its consideration -- two involving congressional subpoenas and a third involving a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney's office, all served on private companies handling Trump's personal finances.

This is a temporary win for Trump. In all three cases, both the trial-level federal district courts and the intermediate level courts of appeals have ruled against Trump and upheld the subpoenas. Had the Supreme Court declined to review the cases, those courts of appeals rulings would have become final, and Trump's tax returns would have been disclosed to Congress and the district attorney.

But, longer term, the ruling might prove to be more of a reprieve for Trump than a win. It would take quite a reversal for the Supreme Court to find that all the lower courts got it wrong -- though, as the nation's highest arbiter, the court certainly can and does overturn lower courts as it sees fit.

Some speculate that it is a good sign for Trump that the Supreme Court agreed to take the case. The court requires four votes (out of nine justices) to grant review. So, the thinking might go, we can assume at least four justices felt a need to take the cases and prevent the lower court rulings from taking effect, signaling an inclination to reverse.

On the other hand, it could be that four (or more) justices voted to take the cases because they recognized the enormous constitutional stakes presented by an inter-branch dispute between Congress and the White House (in the two Congressional cases) and between a state prosecutor and the federal executive branch (in the Manhattan district attorney office's case).

We will get a ruling from the court by June 2020 at the latest. The decision therefore could hit right in the heart of presidential campaign season. Depending on the outcome, the ruling could be either an embarrassing rebuke (and potentially worse) to Trump, or a vindication of his long-claimed right to withhold his personal financial information from Congress and prosecutors.

Tom (Colorado): Will the representatives and senators vote on each article of impeachment separately, or will there be one vote for both articles?

When the full House votes later this week on the two pending articles of impeachment against Trump, each member will vote separately on each article. Similarly, at the conclusion of a Senate trial, each Senator will vote yes or no on each article.

So it won't be an all-or-nothing proposition. Some members of Congress might split their votes -- likely with some members voting ""yes"" on Article I (Abuse of Power relating to Ukraine) but ""no"" on Article II (Obstruction of Congress), reasoning that Trump's defiance of congressional subpoenas is less serious or more defensible than his attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

While not likely, we could end up with a split outcome, with one article passing and the other failing in the House. That type of split decision happened in the Bill Clinton impeachment in 1998. The House Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment, but the full House approved two while rejecting two others.

Gary (New York): Who serves as the defense lawyers and prosecutors in a Senate impeachment trial?

The President can hire any attorneys who are willing to put forward his defense. During the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial, a team comprised of White House counsel and private attorneys defended the President on the Senate floor. Similarly here, it appears Trump will go with White House Counsel Pat Cipollone as his lead attorney, plus reportedly outside attorneys including former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

11,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-russia-china-analysis-nic-robertson-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) President Donald Trump's shock announcement shutting down travel from much of Europe came with the customary back-pedaling common to many of his hastily announced initiatives.

At first, Trump said trade and travel would be targeted, in his latest attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus, staunch market losses and shore up his image as an effective leader. But aides quickly clarified that trade would not be affected, and officials said his plan did not apply to Americans or US permanent residents -- although such travelers would face mandatory quarantines.

While the President has taken shots at Europe's trade policies in the past, it doesn't seem as if he is trying to take competitive advantage of this situation. However that doesn't mean it won't be perceived that way. Implying the coronavirus outbreak in the US is a problem caused by foreigners will smack to many around the world as more of his isolationist US First policies.

His decision will leave an uncomfortable feeling in many European capitals that the transatlantic relationship that Trump has been slowly unpicking for the past few years is about to unravel at an even faster rate.

And while coronavirus is set to exacerbate existing global tensions, some countries, China and Russia in particular, have already been exploiting it.

This week China's President Xi Jinping took a tour of Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, congratulating medical workers on their great job treating tens of thousands of citizens.

That he did it via video link hints that his confidence that the contagion is under total control is not rock solid; but the fact that he is making a big deal of China apparently shaking off the outbreak reveals he is eyeing the opportunities it creates.

Searching for advantage

Russia's President Vladimir Putin also seems to have the same grasp of how the virus can work to his benefit. This week as oil prices collapsed, a calamity he had a hand in, he moved swiftly to cement his grip on power, a plan he's had in his back pocket for years.

In China, by the estimates of the World Health Organization, Xi has pulled off a herculean task in containing the virus, albeit one his own officials allowed to blossom, but it has come at a price.

Where much of the world sees calamity in the coronavirus, Xi has been searching for advantage. Everything is at stake for him: his political leadership at home, China's economy, its position as a world power and ultimately Xi's own strut on the world stage.

No surprise then that he has sought to rehabilitate China's image, casting its response to the virus as one of success from which other countries can learn from. A book published late last month by the government -- in a variety of different languages -- recounts how China won the ""people's war"" against the disease, ""under the centralized and unified leadership of the Communist Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core.""

China's state media has been similarly effusive, skirting over the government's initial missteps and instead focusing on China's alleged ""strength, efficiency and speed in fighting the outbreak.""

But if Xi is using coronavirus to embellish his own credentials, in Moscow Putin is using it to execute both internal and external ambitions.

How all nations weather the virus will be measured by lasting damage to their economies. It is the horrible balance that faces all leaders today, how many lives to lose versus the cost to the economy.

Force everyone to stay home and stop the virus spreading but crash the economy, bury businesses in so much debt they'll never resurface or wait until the last minute, whenever that maybe, and minimize economic pain at a likely cost of the death of many retirees. It's an ugly equation that autocrats seem best placed to play.

Carefully crafted message

Putin chose to make his big move on ""Black Monday,"" the day oil markets crashed off the back of OPEC's failure to agree (with Russia) how to handle the coronavirus crimping oil demand. He announced plans to break Russian presidential term limits and hold on to power until 2036, meaning he will have been in charge for more than a third of a century.

It's been no secret that Putin has been planning to hold power past his current term ending 2024. When he signaled a few months ago he was shifting a few presidential powers to parliament, the world jumped to attention with analysts trying to figure its meaning: an unstable Russia is a big threat to the rest of the world.

Putin works best in the shadows; international scrutiny risks damaging his own carefully crafted domestic media message. He brooks no meaningful dissent, and massages Russian's view of himself and the world.

A distraction on the scale of ""Black Monday"" provided him with the perfect cover to drop his message and minimize international attention. It worked, but it wasn't his only power play this past week.

Coronavirus gave him another opportunity. At the OPEC summit in Vienna last Friday he refused Saudi Arabia's plan to cut oil production, preferring instead to maintain current levels, see the price fall and hurt US shale oil producers whose product is more costly to extract than Russia's crude oil.

Russia is doing better than Trump's America at limiting the onset of the coronavirus -- if the figures that Moscow have released are accurate. Not for the first time Putin is proving more astute than Trump, not just dodging the disease, but taking geopolitical advantage from it.

Xi for sure will be looking for gains at the expense of America too and he has the advantage of apparently being on the leading edge of recovery. So however badly hit his economy is, and however suppressed China's international market will be for months to come, Xi is the one with the advantage just at the moment.

Trump looking flat-footed

Trump on the other hand is at the edge of the coronavirus precipice: the US economy risks a steep fall, triggered in part by downplaying the health threat while focusing on the protective powers of America's economic resilience. And his latest scramble to restrict European travelers is unlikely to catapult Trump out of coronavirus trouble.

Compared to Putin and Xi today, Trump is looking flat-footed. Xi messed up in the beginning but has countered with a massive crackdown on movement that Trump lacks the technology or the strong arm tactics to achieve.

And it's clear that the longer the US or any other nation is affected by the virus the longer it will take to recover economically. Take Italy, with the whole nation under quarantine: it lacks the extreme powers of China to contain and control the population, and is already the poorest of the G7, the group of leading world economies, and could face challenges to stay at the top table.

While experts predict most economies will recover, some countries, perhaps less able than Italy, will be susceptible to the machinations of less well-intentioned nations.

Russia has wanted to be back in the G7, formerly the G8, since it was thrown out in 2014 for invading Ukraine, and indeed Italy has been one of the loudest advocates for Russia's re-admission.

Lives are at stake in this epidemic, but geopolitics is well and truly in play, and to win that battle, nations need to get the medicine right.","Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up","Where much of the world sees calamity in the coronavirus, Xi has been searching for advantage.

823,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/10/opinions/trump-grisham-white-house-coronavirus-exposure-dantonio/index.html,"(CNN) White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham says that in this time of coronavirus it'll be business as usual for Donald Trump. He's not going to cancel any rallies or worry much at all about whether he's been exposed to infection, it seems. ""And I'll tell you what,"" she says , ""with our President, this man who doesn't sleep and who I have seen work 15, 16 hours a day every day, I have no problem thinking that he is going to be just fine and just healthy.""

If Grisham had been concerned about the American public, she might not have talked about how attending big public events, working yourself to the bone, and skipping sleep is a reasonable response to the threat the virus poses to us all. In fact, if this is what Trump is doing, it's the opposite of what is recommended for an obese , largely sedentary man of 73.

With any other president, we'd all be wondering what got into an aide who strained so hard to suggest the boss is some sort of superman, but this is Trump we're talking about. The man's narcissism and propensity for rage are well documented and Grisham was obviously playing to both qualities.

Long a subject of press reports, Trump's anger has been evidenced as he has fired cabinet members, chiefs of staff -- Mick Mulvaney, who never even got the chance to shed the ""acting"" in front of the title was dismissed just last weekend -- and those who testified about him during his impeachment. Administration officials are generally worried about delivering bad news to the boss for fear of how he'll respond. When a CDC official recently noted, correctly, that a coronavirus outbreak was inevitable in the US, Politico reported that Trump got so angry officials discussed ordering her to stop making public statements. (They eventually decided against this.)

Having made the point that Trump isn't changing anything, Grisham stayed true to the President's why-worry attitude. When she went the further step, to explain that he's an extraordinary specimen who doesn't need sleep and can work rings around mere mortals she played to the vanity that is his other defining characteristic. As Grisham and other administration survivors seem to know (I'm looking at you, Vice President Mike Pence), you can never go wrong by putting the President at the center of every discussion and slathering him with praise.

In the current crisis, the problem is not so much the President's overweening self-regard but his inability to recognize the needs of others. This problem, invariably a characteristic of the truly narcissistic, makes it difficult if not impossible for someone to put others first. In families, it can be evidenced by the parent who buys himself a new car when the rent is overdue. In countries, it is seen when a leader can't seem to see what people need in a moment of crisis.

Whether he's throwing paper towels into a crowd amid death and devastation in Puerto Rico or mocking victims of sexual assault, Trump has shown himself to be callous with enough regularity that he has taught us to cringe when we see him in a moment where concern for others is required. Remember how he joked about crowd sizes when he visited a hospital after a mass shooting in El Paso? How about the time, at the beginning of his term, when he stood at a memorial for fallen intelligence officers and bragged about his own intellect

Compassion, which is the opposite of narcissism, is as essential to the presidency as any trait and presidents of both parties have shown it often. We all remember the moving responses from Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W. Bush after the attacks of 9/11 and Barack Obama after the Charleston church shooting. It is something we have relied on from our leaders. It is also the piece so often missing from Trump's response to difficult times. This is the man, who, a Huffington Post video showed, needed an e motional cheat sheet for a meeting with survivors of school shootings. That the prompts encouraged him to say, ""I hear you,"" is all the evidence we need to know that the White House staff recognizes that the President struggles when it comes to compassion.

Why is Trump like this? When I wrote a biography of him I learned that he was raised by a role model father who showed his son little of the sort of tenderness that would produce concern for others in a child. His education was guided by a military school drill sergeant who was toughness personified, and his introduction to the adult world was shaped by the well-known character assassin Roy Cohn. Given these mentors, and all the insecurity that came with being a rich kid playing with daddy's money, Trump was all but destined to be the man we see today. He is angry and narcissistic, and the best those around him can do is coddle him in the hopes that he won't make things worse.",Coronavirus shows up Trump's compassion deficit,"(CNN) White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham says that in this time of coronavirus it'll be business as usual for Donald Trump.

The two transparent domes sit next to a large enclosure inhabited by three rescued elephants, which are cared for by the resort's Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation

Guests can sit back and watch as these female elephants play with the strategically placed ""toys"" that hang from large trees, their powerful trunks occasionally ripping off huge chunks of bark and branches, sending loud cracks through the evening air.

But really, they mainly just want to eat.

Thankfully, a hefty supply of sugar cane is placed within eyesight of the bubbles, meaning the elephants are almost always just a few steps away.

Once-in-a-lifetime experience

l e v a r t

The bubbles are booked as an ""experience"" in addition to your reserved resort room, for 17,700 baht (US$563) per night per couple. This means you can just pack an overnight bag and leave the rest of your belongings in your suite.

Guests are picked up from the lobby just before sunset, then driven down a dirt road in an open-air jeep before taking a short walk through the resort's rice paddy to get to the bubbles.

Shortly after arrival, staff deliver an evening picnic basket, filled with pre-selected sandwiches and other cold dishes, allowing you to eat alongside the animals. There's a strict ""no hands"" policy when it comes to the elephants though -- bubble guests are not allowed to touch or feed them.

So how comfortable are the bubbles?

Each air-conditioned, pressurized 22-square-meter space is a mini slice of luxury, furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. There's a small washroom with a toilet and shower, along with a couple of chairs and a small table near the bed. No TVs here -- the elephants are the star of this show.

Sensitive sleepers will find It particularly surreal. As night passed during a recent visit, the moon made its way over the bubble, offering various levels of illumination. (Eye masks are provided as it can be surprisingly bright.)

Given these ladies don't nod off much -- elephants in captivity sleep only 4-6 hours a day -- you'll hear all sorts of delightful sounds throughout the night and might find yourself crawling out of bed for a late-night peek.

The bed features wrap-around curtains, offering privacy for those who worry they won't wake up before the caretakers arrive with the elephants' breakfast.

Trial and error

The idea for the ""Jungle Bubbles"" came from General Manager GaudÃÂ©ric Harang, who has been with the resort for about a year and a half. He says they were born of a desire to push the boundaries and offer a unique guest experience in line with modern luxury expectations.

In addition to safety concerns -- ""making sure our bubbles would be elephant proof"" -- he says they had to meet very high standards.

""As a top notch resort, we had to ensure the experience would be very luxurious and to the level of what is expected by our guests,"" he explains.

Once the bubbles were set up, Harang was the first to trial them.

""Being in the north of Thailand, we are lucky to have a climate that's more varied than in the rest of the country,"" he says. ""Though short, we go through a winter season that is very cold. When the bubbles were finally ready [in December] it was 6 degrees Celsius in the morning and...well I froze!

""There was no heater. Also, being located in the jungle there is a lot of humidity so the bubbles were very wet at night due to all the condensation. So, I woke up at 3 a.m., soaked and cold.""

As a result, the bubbles are now equipped with an air conditioner, space heater and dehumidifier to ensure a comfortable climate for all seasons.

""When I finally saw the bubbles in place I was so happy it all worked out, but I think I was only really impressed when I slept in it the second time [after the climate issues were sorted],"" he recalls, telling CNN Travel it was truly a ""wow"" moment.

""When you finally live it, you see it's really a fantastic experience. We couldn't have planned it better.""

The right elephants for the job

Picking the right elephants for the Jungle Bubbles experience was another logistical issue that needed to be sorted, says John Roberts, Anantara's Director of Elephants.

Besides size considerations -- how many elephants could comfortably live on the available plot of land? -- they also had to decide which of the camp's elephants would enjoy being together in the enclosure. Turns out, even elephants can get into tiffs with their friends -- just like humans but with an additional 3.5 tonnes of weight to throw around.

The three elephants in the Jungle Bubbles enclosure all arrived at the resort between 2006-2010, so Roberts and his team already had ample time to get familiar with their temperaments.

""We watched them for a long time,"" says Roberts. ""We know that they like being together -- actually [two of them] are pretty much inseparable at this stage and if you try and separate them they get pretty stressed.""

Offering a better life to captive elephants

Anantara's nonprofit Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation (GTAEF), founded in 2006 and overseen by Roberts, cares for about two dozen elephants.

Most of the animals have led hard lives -- some spent their days walking the streets of Bangkok with their owners, making money begging from tourists. Others came from tourist trekking camps.

The way the program works is the foundation invites mahouts (elephant trainers/owners) and their families to move to Chiang Rai with their elephants and live in the foundation's camp.

The foundation offers them a wage, which includes the cost of care for their elephants. This amounts to about $18,000 per elephant per year.

Roberts acknowledges that in a perfect world all elephants would be roaming free in the wild but the situation is incredibly complex.

""Unfortunately, you can't release elephants in Thailand,"" he says, rattling off a long list of complications including fears of disease transmission, potential conflict in a fragile wild herd and an inability for domesticated elephants to fend for themselves given they've spent most if not all of their lives in captivity. And then there are Thailand's laws, which would also need to be changed.

Thailand's domesticated elephants are all registered under the Draft Animals Act, so ""if you put a captive elephant in a national park you're officially illegally grazing your livestock and that's the law as it is,"" says Roberts.

As an alternative, the GTAEF aims to improve the welfare of captive elephants through various programs not just at its resort but throughout the region -- including mahout training -- while also taking part in conservation and wild elephant programs.

At the resort's elephant camp, this means figuring out the elephants' personalities though science and observation and matching them with activities that suit them -- an essential part of their well-being. For instance, elephants that are comfortable around strangers take part in the peaceful ""Walking with Giants"" experience.

""In the wild their entire lives are based around walking long distances and finding food,"" says Roberts. ""They have big brains, you have to keep them stimulated doing different things. You could just put them out there in a field, but they'll stand in one spot all day.""

593,https://us.cnn.com/2020/01/11/health/flu-blinds-iowa-girl-eprise/index.html,"(CNN) A 4-year-old girl in Iowa nearly died and is now blind because of the flu, and her parents have a message: Get your child vaccinated.

""If I can stop one child from getting sick, that's what I want to do,"" said Amanda Phillips. ""It's terrible to see your child suffer like this.""

Jade DeLucia, who did not receive a flu shot this season, caught the flu a few days before Christmas and spent nearly two weeks in the intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital.

""She is lucky to be alive,"" said one of her physicians, Dr. Theresa Czech . ""She's a little fighter. And I think she's super lucky.""

Her parents, who've missed work to care for Jade and face medical bills, have started a GoFundMe page

Every year, dozens of children die from the flu, and most of them had not received a flu shot, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Thousands more children are hospitalized.

Many of those who becomes seriously ill or died were perfectly healthy before they contracted the flu.

Jade is one of them.

'It's a little bug'

On December 19, Phillips noticed that Jade wasn't quite her usually bubbly self.

""She'd say, 'Mom, I don't feel good,' and we'd cuddle on the couch,"" Phillips remembers.

A few times over the next several days, Jade spiked a low-grade fever. Medicine brought it down easily, and she went back to playing with her older sister, Catalina.

""She was running around, having fun, eating normally, asking for snacks,"" her mother remembers. ""It was just -- it's a little bug, she'll get over it.""

Phillips thinks back to those four days, December 19 through December 23, and wracks her brain for something that might have told her what was about to happen.

""There wasn't any sign that would've told me that something was seriously wrong with her,"" she said.

'We have to go to the emergency room'

The night of December 23, while Phillips was working her shift as an assistant manager at a Dollar General store, Jade's father, Stephen DeLucia, tucked Jade into bed.

The next morning, the family was ready to leave the house to spend Christmas Eve with Phillips' parents. But Jade hadn't yet woken up.

When her father went to check on her, Jade was lying in bed, unresponsive. And her body was burning hot.

""I yelled at him -- I was like, 'We have to go. We have to go to the emergency room. This isn't right. Something's not right with her,"" Phillips said.

When they arrived at Covenant Medical Center, Jade's body started shaking uncontrollably, and her eyes rolled to the back of her head.

She was having a seizure.

Doctors filled the room. They said Jade needed to be transferred to the children's hospital at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, about 80 miles away. There was no time for an ambulance. She would have to be flown.

Her parents watched the helicopter take off.

""I didn't think I was going to see her again at that point,"" Phillips said. ""I really didn't. Just from looking at her, I really honestly didn't think I was going to see her.""

Bad news on Christmas Day

On Christmas Day, Phillips and DeLucia found out flu had affected her brain.

Called encephalopathy, it's a known complication of the flu, according to the CDC

Doctors showed Jade's parents the MRI results. Her brain was ""lit up like a Christmas tree,"" her mother remembers.

""They said she had significant brain damage. They said our child might not ever wake up, and if she did, she might not ever be the same,"" she said.

Over the next few days, Jade remained almost completely unresponsive.

Czech, a pediatric neurologist, was brought in to consult on Jade's case. On December 31, she told Jade's parents her specific diagnosis: acute necrotizing encephalopathy , or ANE, a type of encephalopathy usually caused by a viral infection.

ANE is so rare there are few studies on how children fare. Czech found one study that looked at four children with ANE. Three of them died.

""It's been 7 days. 7 days of it feeling like Jade was slipping away and that there was no hope. No hope of her ever coming back to us,"" her mother wrote on Facebook that day. ""All because of the flu.""

Czech prescribed steroids to calm the swelling in her brain.

And finally, Jade's parents received some good news.

A New Year's gift

CNN visited Jade's family on January 1. Her family started the new year with a prayer.

""Heavenly father will you wrap your angels around Jade this morning and throughout the day and pray for healing today,"" the prayer went.

Then, they visited Jade at the hospital -- and her mother came out beaming.

What had seemed so unlikely had happened: Jade woke up.

""She's got her eyes open. She's looking around. We got a couple of hand squeezes! And then we got a smile!"" she said.

Over the next few days, Jade kept getting better and better. Her breathing tube came out. She could sit up. She could eat -- and specifically requested chocolate pudding.

""Jade said 'Hi mommy' and you guys I'm a mess,"" Phillips wrote on Facebook on January 5.

But then Jade's parents and doctors noticed something.

Flu causes blindness

When her mother put Jade's favorite stuffed animal -- a white unicorn -- in front of her face, she didn't look at it.

When she threw a little ball, she didn't watch it as it went up in the air.

An ophthalmologist came in and examined Jade's eyes. Everything looked fine.

The problem wasn't with her eyes. It was with her brain, which had suffered because of the flu.

""It affected the part of her brain that perceives sight, and we don't know if she's going to get her vision back,"" said Czech, Jade's neurologist. ""In about three to six months from now we'll know. Whatever recovery she has at six months, that's likely all she's going to get.""

Jade might also have cognitive or developmental problems, such as learning disabilities, Czech added. She said that would be determined in the months and years to come.

But considering that Jade arrived at the hospital unresponsive on Christmas Eve, Czech is amazed at her progress.

""I think she's doing fabulous,"" she said.

Jade's homecoming

Jade went home January 9.

One of the first things she did was touch her sister's face and then pulled her close and cried.

Relieved to have her daughter back home, Phillips wants to get a message to other families about the flu shot.

Last March, when Jade's sister had her annual well visit at the pediatrician, both girls received a flu shot. Phillips says she thought that shot was good for an entire year. She didn't realize she needed to get the girls vaccinated again for the new 2019-2020 flu season.

Since the flu virus changes year to year, the vaccine also changes. Flu vaccines become available at the end of the summer, and the CDC recommends getting one by the end of October to protect against flu in the upcoming winter.

This year, the flu has been particularly tough on children. That's because the predominant virus has been influenza B, which affects children more than adults. So far, 32 children in the United States have died from flu this season, 21 from the influenza B strain of the virus.

""We want parents to know they should get a flu shot every season,"" Phillips said.

It's true that the flu vaccine is only about 40-60% effective at preventing the flu, according to the CDC

But that's not the point, says Dr. Adam Ratner , a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health in New York City.

What parents need to know is that a vaccine is very effective at preventing children from becoming so sick from flu that there are life-threatening complications, like Jade did.

A 2014 study showed that flu vaccine reduced a child's risk of being admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit by 74%. A 2017 study showed the vaccine also significantly reduced a child's risk of dying from the flu, according to the CDC

""I'm less interested in whether the vaccine prevents all cases of runny noses and feeling cruddy and having to stay home from school because of the flu,"" Ratner said. ""That's no fun, but you get the vaccine not so much to prevent that as to prevent the chances of having a horrible complication of the flu.""

Back in Iowa, Phillips and DeLucia are settling into their new normal with Jade, Phillips writing on Facebook on her daughter's first night home: ""My brave girl, who cannot see, but is loved by so many.""",Flu leaves a 4-year-old girl blind in Iowa,"(CNN) A 4-year-old girl in Iowa nearly died and is now blind because of the flu, and her parents have a message: Get your child vaccinated.

Sometimes, fashion's greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.

Ginsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those ""disappeared"" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.

Today, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.

Beyond a feminizing touch

Given her historic position and stature -- she's the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.

Associate Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Credit: Paul J. Richards/Getty Images

In adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.

Beyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.

There is her favorite ""majority"" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her ""dissenting"" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in ""Ruth"") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her ""dissenting"" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).

Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's ""majority"" collar. Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

When espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.

When worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.

But those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not ""wear"" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least""straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as ""mind"" or ""spirit,"" while women represent the baser realms of ""body"" and ""flesh.""

Re-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes

To clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.

This risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.

Ginsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of ""body"" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.

To re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most ""noticeable"" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).

Ginsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.

And finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.

This has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary ""RBG"" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg's judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in ""RBG drag,"" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: ""Imagine yourself here! This could be you!""

Of course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.

324,https://us.cnn.com/2017/06/02/world/tonys-chocolonely-slavery-free-chocolate/index.html,"Amsterdam (CNN) From its base in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam, a confectionery company is doing its bit to fight modern-day slavery.

Its unconventional weapon of choice? A rich range of chocolate products.

""We are a funny company,"" says Henk Jan Beltman, chief chocolate officer at Tony's Chocolonely.

""The reason that we are a company is not that we want to sell chocolate and not that we want to make money."" Instead, Beltman adds: ""We want to make the world a nicer place.""

Tony's Chocolonely is one of many companies dedicated to producing what's known as Fair Trade chocolate by providing better prices to farmers and slave free working conditions.

Each bar is marketed with a promise to the consumer that no slave labor was used in the making of its chocolate.

""But if we can do it then the big guys can do it as well."" Hide Caption 7 of 7

The cocoa sector, worth more than $100 billion per year, has long battled with poor labor practices and forms of exploitation.

A 2015 report from Tulane University and the U.S. Department of Labor found that more than two million children were working in what it defined as ""hazardous"" conditions in the cocoa industry in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.

According to the World Fair Trade Organization, one of the 10 guiding principles of the Fair Trade movement is to ensure good working conditions and ensure no forced labor has been used in the manufacture of any product.

Yet Tony's Chocolonely believes the industry can further address this issue and that chocolate no longer needs to be a guilty pleasure.

Beltman says, ""If you look at certification like the Rainforest Alliance or Fair Trade or UTZ, those are all good but they don't manufacture a product ... and as a product owner you feel responsibility and it's your responsibility to sell something you can be proud of.

""Whether it's fish or phones or chocolate bars, it's always the owner who is responsible for the stuff that they sell ... and a certification body is never going to take that responsibility away.""

Art of the chocolatier

Its recipe for slave free chocolate starts on its cocoa farms.

By focusing on the fine details of its supply chain, Tony's Chocolonely says it traces the origin of the cocoa it buys -- all the way from the beans purchased directly from its farm cooperatives in West Africa to the finished product.

Yet it hasn't been working alone. Industry giant Barry Callebaut has become a strategic partner.

At its factory in the town of Wieze, Belgium, Barry Callebaut has built a system that isolates Tony's Chocolonely product.

Plant director, Xavier De Buysscher, says Tony's Chocolonely beans are treated, roasted and segregated. Its liquid chocolate is stored into a separate tank.

Once this process is complete, the product is molded by Belgian chocolate masters, Althea, which stamps an ethical message into each bar.

The unequal shape of the end product reflects inequality in the world and outlines the West African countries that supply the beans.

This detail is in keeping with the Tony's Chocolonely marketing strategy, to remind the consumer how and why the company began.

Life on the plantation

In 2003, Dutch journalists behind popular show ""The Consumer Investigation Agency"" exposed the trafficking of boys from Burkina Faso to the Ivory Coast, interviewing former slaves about life on the cocoa plantations.

The production team proposed to their audience that by eating chocolate all were complicit in slavery. After gathering testimonies from those who had been enslaved, reporter Teun Van De Keuken, unsuccessfully attempted to get himself arrested by the Dutch authorities to emphasize the point.

Three years later, determined to prove chocolate could be made slave-free, the journalists founded Tony's Chocolonely.

Now run by an executive team, the original founders have left the company. But cocoa labor abuses remain in the headlines.

The 2015 Tulane University report said the number of child laborers in cocoa production in Ghana and the Ivory Coast had increased by 13% from the time the last study had been conducted five years before.

It also cited endemic poverty as a major reason trafficking and unethical labor practices flourish in the region.

Taste of success

According to Beltman, Tony's Chocolonely operation has been hugely successful so far.

""We launched as a journalist initiative ... but all of a sudden by sending out the message people were buying the product and talking about [it],"" Beltman says.

""We hit one million euro ($1.1 million) revenue in the first year. This year we aim to hit around $50 million in revenue.""

Yet it's not just rising profitability that points to success at Tony's Chocolonely.

The fact that its methods have been fruitful is equally satisfying for all at the company.

""We only work with 7,000 farmers. We are a tiny company. But if we can do it then the big guys can do it as well,"" Beltman says. ""Then we solve the problem of slavery in the value chain of cocoa.""

""I'm gonna push as hard as we can to actually force other companies to work in the same way. There is no one in the world who wants to enjoy chocolate that comes from a source that's enslaved,"" he adds.",Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure,"Photos: Dutch chocolate brand Tony's Chocolonely claims to be made without slave labor.

670,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/us/us-sports-coronavirus-response/index.html,"(CNN) Perhaps nothing illustrates the wide-ranging effects the novel coronavirus has had on the United States as the state it left major US sports in on Thursday.

By the afternoon, most professional leagues and the governing body of major college sports had canceled or postponed a slew of games and major events. Some elected to go ahead -- without fans in the stands.

""This is time for big events like March Madness, big events like these big sports arena things to take a pause for the next four to six to eight weeks,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said at a House Oversight Committee hearing in Washington, ""while we see what happens with this outbreak in this nation.""

Here's a look at the impact on major sports:

NBA decides to suspend season

The National Basketball Association announced Wednesday night it would suspend its season after a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus.

The first player, identified by ESPN and other outlets as all-star center Rudy Gobert, was later joined by a second Jazz player who tested positive, the team said Thursday.

Initially, the NBA postponed the Jazz's game against Oklahoma Thunder before it announced it would suspend the rest of the season after Wednesday night's games.

""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,"" the NBA said in a statement.

NCAA pulls plug on March Madness

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) on Thursday canceled March Madness -- the men's Division I basketball tournament and the biggest annual event in college basketball -- as well as other winter and spring NCAA championships.

""This decision is based on the evolving Covid-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities,"" NCAA said in a statement.

The NCAA previously said March Madness would proceed without any fans , and that only essential staff members and family members would be allowed to attend.

""I know it is a great disappointment to our student-athletes and coaches, whose hard work and dedication to their sports and Duke is inspirational to so many,"" said President Vincent E. Price, ""but we must first look out for their health and well-being. This is clearly an unprecedented moment for our university, our region and the wider world.""

Multiple college conferences also canceled ongoing basketball tournaments, including the Big Ten Conference and the SEC, among others.

MLB calls off spring training, delays season

Major League Baseball will cancel its remaining spring training schedule and delay Opening Day -- scheduled for March 26 -- back by at least two weeks, the league said Thursday.

""Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of our players, employees and fans,"" the league said in a statement. ""MLB will continue to undertake the precautions and best practices recommended by public health experts. We send our best wishes to all individuals and communities that have been impacted by coronavirus.""

Statement from Major League Baseball: pic.twitter.com/0bWS5VTRPu Ã¢ÂÂ MLB (@MLB) March 12, 2020

MLB plans to announce the postponement's impacts on the schedule at a later point, ""with the hope of resuming normal operations as soon as possible,"" the statement said.

MLS sidelines games for a month

""Our clubs were united today in the decision to temporarily suspend our season -- based on the advice and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Agency of Canada, and other public health authorities, and in the best interest of our fans, players, officials and employees,"" MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement. ""We'd like to thank our fans for their continued support during this challenging time.""

The news came after the Seattle Sounders postponed its home match on Saturday at CenturyLink Field against FC Dallas.

US Soccer calls off games through April

""With the health of our players, coaches, staff and fans as our main priority, US Soccer has decided it was in the best interest to cancel the majority of our upcoming domestic and international camps at all levels, including our senior Men's and Women's National Team games in March and April, due to the outbreak of COVID-19,"" US Soccer Chief Medical Officer George Chiampas said in a statement Thursday.

The USMNT was set to play the Netherlands in two matches later this month, while the USWNT was scheduled to host Australia on April 10 in Sandy, Utah, and Brazil on April 14 in San Jose, California.

NHL suspends season

The National Hockey League said it would suspend its season, effective immediately.

The league had been preparing for the developments without ""taking premature or unnecessary measures,"" Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

""However, following last night's news that an NBA player has tested positive for coronavirus -- and given that our leagues share so many facilities and locker rooms and it now seems likely that some member of the NHL community would test positive at some point -- it is no longer appropriate to try to continue to play games at this time,"" Bettman said.

PGA Tour cancels events as the Masters postpones

The PGA Tour announced late Thursday the Players Championship was canceled.

The tour was also canceling all other events in the coming weeks through the Valero Texas Open (March 30 to April 5), it said in a statement.

""We have pledged from the start to be responsible, thoughtful and transparent with our decision process,"" the Tour said. ""We did everything possible to create a safe environment for our players in order to continue the event throughout the weekend, and we were endeavoring to give our fans a much-needed respite from the current climate.""

But the situation is rapidly changing, organizers wrote, and ""the right thing to do for our players and our fans is to pause.""

""Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision,"" said Chairman Fred Ridley . ""We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date.""

NASCAR restricting attendance

NASCAR will hold races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Homestead-Miami Speedway without fans in attendance, it said in a statement.

""These events will be restricted to competitors, crews, officials and other necessary personnel to conduct the race,"" the statement said. ""We will work with public health officials as we determine future scheduling beyond these events.""

The Boston Marathon gets postponed

The Boston Marathon has been postponed until September 14, Mayor Marty Walsh said Friday. It was scheduled to take place on April 20.

""Our expectation and the hope right now is that this date will get us to a safer place in relation to the spread of the coronavirus,"" Walsh said.

The Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race, said in a statement it understood the decision to postpone.

""On matters of public health and safety we take our guidance from the officials entrusted with protecting the public in this area,"" CEO Tom Grilk said. ""We understand our role, along with our partners, in ensuring a safe environment for all participants, volunteers, spectators, and supporters that meets the standards set by those officials.""",Major sports leagues in the US halt play or exclude fans over coronavirus outbreaks,"By the afternoon, most professional leagues and the governing body of major college sports had canceled or postponed a slew of games and major events.

558,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/health/10-sleep-commandments-wellness/index.html,"(CNN) Air, water, food -- and some would argue sex -- are key ingredients to human survival. In reality, there should be another ""s"" word in that list: sleep.

We're supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night, depending on our age, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that a third of Americans sleep fewer than seven hours a night. It's a global problem too.

""Sleep problems constitute a global epidemic that threatens health and quality of life for up to 45% of the world's population,"" according to the World Sleep Society, a non-profit organization of sleep professionals dedicated to advancing ""sleep health worldwide.""

It's the sponsor of World Sleep Day, which in 2020 is on Friday, March 13.

Yet how does anyone get to sleep today in the turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic? Workplaces and schools are shutting down, meaning hourly workers are without paychecks if they can't work and children used to free lunch are not getting fed -- never mind our concerns about elections, global stock market meltdowns or escalating border or trade wars.

It's a lot, folks, but failing to sleep isn't going to make things better.

Poor sleep contributes to weight gain, a lack of sex drive, a dysfunctional immune system, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, depression, anxiety and other disorders.

Yet despite this nuclear fallout for our health, we still don't prioritize sleep -- even when the stock market isn't crashing.

To combat that, sleep experts from the World Sleep Society have created these ten commandments of sleep hygiene for weary adults.

Establish a regular bedtime and waking time

Messing with our circadian rhythm, the internal sleep clock that tells us when it's time to sleep and rise, has been linked to hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and, most recently, the risk of having a heart attack or heart disease.

Changing your regular sleep-wake time by 90 minutes in either direction, which many of us do on the weekends, doubled the risk of cardiovascular disease over a five-year period. The more days you sleep irregularly, the higher the risk, a study found.

""People are living busy, stressful lives and not getting a lot of sleep during the week,"" Dr. David Goff, who directs the division of cardiovascular sciences at the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, told CNN in a recent interview.

""Then they are trying to get catchup sleep on the weekend, and that's not a healthy pattern,"" Goff said.

Watch your napping

While an occasional short snooze can be healthy, the World Sleep Society's second commandment warns: ""If you are in the habit of taking siestas, do not exceed 45 minutes of daytime sleep.""

One reason is because we typically enter a ""deep sleep"" cycle about 30 to 40 minutes into a nap. Waking up from deep sleep produces that ""Where am I?"" grogginess that is worse than no nap at all. A long nap can also interfere with your body clock, making it more difficult to fall asleep later that night.

Generally, catnaps that are approximately 15 to 20 minutes are fine, experts say, and may reduce fatigue; boost creativity; increase alertness; jumpstart cognitive performance; and improve mood. But try to do them earlier in the day -- before 3 p.m. -- to avoid affecting that night's full sleep cycle.

No alcohol or cigarettes

The third commandment is to ""avoid excessive alcohol ingestion four hours before bedtime, and do not smoke.""

It's truly a myth that a drink will help you sleep better at night. Instead, it traps you in the lighter stages of sleep and ""dramatically reduces the quality of your rest at night,"" said Rebecca Robbins, a fellow at Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, in a prior CNN interview.

""It continues to pull you out of rapid eye movement and the deeper stages of sleep, causing you to wake up not feeling restored,"" Robbins said.

Avoid caffeine six hours before bedtime

Here's a no-brainer: Boycott caffeine at least six hours before your normal bedtime (some experts say nothing after 3 p.m.). And caffeine is in more than just coffee, so the World Sleep Society also warns about tea and many sodas, as well as chocolate.

Yes, chocolate. That cup of hot chocolate you think may help you sleep could contain 25 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of green or black tea will provide 50 milligrams of caffeine.

Avoid eating certain foods

The fifth commandment: ""Avoid heavy, spicy, or sugary foods four hours before bedtime.""

Heavy and spicy foods may give you heartburn or other digestive issues, thus affecting your ability to get and stay asleep. As for sugar, studies show it's linked to restless, disturbed sleep and may possibly affect hormones that control cravings.

A light snack before bed ""is acceptable,"" according to the commandment. The National Sleep Foundation recommends munching on a handful of nuts; a few cherries (which are high in melatonin); a banana (which contains muscle relaxers potassium and magnesium) and decaffeinated teas such as chamomile, ginger and peppermint.

Exercise regularly, but not right before bed

Surveys of vigorous exercisers by the National Sleep Foundation show they are almost twice as likely to report high-quality, regular sleep compared to non-exercisers, and sitting for long periods of time is thought to be connected to poor sleep.

While studies haven't proven that exercise just before bed will harm sleep, many experts -- like the World Sleep Society -- recommend avoiding it. Why? Because moderate exercise heats up your core temperature, signaling the body that it's time to be awake, while the release of endorphins is thought to keep some of us alert.

Of course if you're a night owl, that may not apply to you -- so listen to your body clock. For any of us, however, doing some yoga, Tai chi or light stretching before bed could help with relaxation.

Improve your sleep environment

Having just the right sleep environment is so important that the remaining four commandments focus on how to do that.

First, keep your bedroom well-ventilated and pick a comfortable sleep temperature setting. Science is pretty much sure that a cool temperature is best, so aim for between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius).

Make sure you have ""comfortable, inviting bedding"" that fits your personal preferences (and hopefully that of any significant bed partner). ""Block out all distracting noise"" -- I sleep with a fan every night -- and get rid of any light, even the blue light from your charging smartphone.

While you're at it, go ahead and turn off any work alerts (Slack or email ping at 2 a.m., anyone?). Better still, just charge the thing outside your bedroom.

And last, but not least, ""reserve your bed for sleep and sex."" As normal as it seems to work from home in bed or play games with the kids in bed, that doesn't teach your brain to view the bedroom as a place for slumber.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

That's right, just like your dog knows a walk is coming when it sees the leash, you can train your brain to associate your bed with sleep.

And there you have it. Hopefully these 10 commandments can help you part the seas to successful slumber.

Can't do all 10 things? Pick just one, and see if you can make it happen. Little successes will build upon each other and lead to a happier (and more rested) you.",10 commandments for better sleep on World Sleep Day,"""Sleep problems constitute a global epidemic that threatens health and quality of life for up to 45% of the world's population,"" according to the World Sleep Society, a non-profit organization of sleep professionals dedicated to advancing ""sleep health worldwide.""

850,https://us.cnn.com/2020/02/28/opinions/amie-harwick-orders-of-protection-drexler/index.html,"Peggy Drexler is a research psychologist and the author of ""Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family"" and ""Raising Boys Without Men."" She is at work on a book about how women are conditioned to compete with one another. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) On Thursday friends and family laid to rest the well-known Los Angeles sex therapist and author Amie Harwick, who was found dead earlier this month in her Hollywood Hills home. Police had responded to neighbor reports of a ""woman screaming."" A former boyfriend, Gareth Pursehouse, was charged with one count of murder in her death and one count of first-degree residential burglary. Harwick was 38.

The tragic details have been slowly coming outÃ¢ÂÂHarwick appears to have been strangled before she was thrown from a third-floor balcony at her Hollywood Hills apartment, the latter injury killing her, according to the LA medical examiner.

But one important fact emerged early on: Harwick had twice sought restraining orders against Pursehouse, in 2011 and 2012, copies of which CNN has obtained. The 2012 order barred him from contact with her and, though a judge granted an extension, expired in 2015. Police said that Harwick saw Pursehouse at an event last month, after which she ""expressed fear of him.""

We can't know what precisely happened in this case, or how Pursehouse may respond to the charges against himÃ¢ÂÂhis arraignment is scheduled for next week. It remains unclear whether he has legal representation. What we do know is that the claims in the restraining orders Harwick filed against her former boyfriend bear all the hallmarks of an abusive relationship.

In the 2011 request for a restraining order, Harwick alleges physical abuse at the hands of Pursehouse that include choking, suffocation, pushing, kicking and punching. She also describes an incident in which she was pushed out of a car by Pursehouse on a freeway off-ramp.

The 2012 request claims Pursehouse broke into Harwick's apartment complex multiple times, once smashing picture frames, another time taping dozens of flowers to her door. She also details threatening text messages and emails.

If the charges against Pursehouse are proven, they may point up a chilling reality: A restraining order can only do so much.

In any instance of a threatening ex-partner, one might assume, or hope, that being the object of such legal intervention would bring that person up short--that exposure of his (or her) inappropriate behavior to the legal system would enforce a cooling down period, maybe create space for acceptance that a relationship has ended.

But this is too often not what happens. It's but one of many shortcomings that advocates for victims of domestic abuse describe when talking about the effective protections available to those in such relationships.

To be sure, domestic abuse has long been a huge problem in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as many as one in four women and one in nine men are victims of domestic abuse, though the numbers may even be higher.

Abuse is chronically underreported, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, or RAINN, which operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline : Only about a quarter of all physical assaults and one half of stalkings are reported to the police. That's often because cases can be difficult to prosecute.

Often a ""he said, she said"" mentality prevails, and most cases require the testimony of the victim, which many are unwilling to provideÃ¢ÂÂbecause they're scared, because they're worried of what their abuser might do if they don't win, or simply because the nature of abusive relationships means victims often blame themselves: If I didn't act this way, say this thing, forget to do that, he wouldn't behave as he does. I can make it stop.

Except she can't. And neither, in many cases, can the legal system. Perpetrators of sexual violence are less likely to go to jail than other criminals. According to RAINN, of 230 incidents of assault reported to police, just five cases will lead to a felony conviction.

While restraining orders can be effective, they are often difficult to uphold. According to a report in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law that surveyed a broad array of research studies and legal, sociological and mental health literature, reported rates of restraining-order violation across the country vary from as low as 7.1% to as high as 81.3%.

2008 study of restraining orders among victims of intimate partner homicide, meanwhile, found that about 11% of women killed by male intimate partners had been issued a restraining order; one-fifth of those victims were killed within two days of the order being issued, and about one-third were killed within a month.

Traditional restraining ordersÃ¢ÂÂthe kind that, in general, prohibit an abuser from coming near the person who sought the orderÃ¢ÂÂmeanwhile, expire. They require victims to file them and report violations, and only work against those who fear law enforcement. And, well, in the end, they're just a piece of paper. They aren't ankle monitors, there's no GPS capability attached.

A victim can call the police if the person against whom she's been granted a restraining or no contact order shows up at her officeÃ¢ÂÂbut he's already shown up at her office. With nothing, physically, to stop him.

A 2018 piece in The Atlantic looking at the evolution of restraining orders to prohibit abusive digital communication, meanwhile, noted how difficult they are to enforceÃ¢ÂÂgiven the wide-reaching nature of social mediaÃ¢ÂÂand, therefore, how often they fail.

Again, the details of Harwick's murder are still emerging, and we don't know if her ex-boyfriend had a hand in her death.

In the meantime, friends of Harwick have started an online petition that seeks stronger recourse and support for domestic violence victims, including making restraining orders valid for longer than five years without need for a renewal, and eliminating the need for victims to appear in court to testify against their abusers, according to the LA Times. They also seek to mandate counseling for alleged abusers.

All three measures would be huge improvements to the current systemÃ¢ÂÂso much so that it's a wonder they aren't already in place. ""We want to push for laws to be changed in her honor so this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" Harwick's friend Diana Arias said.

1119,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/upshot/mystery-of-missing-bus-riders.html,"Bus Ridership Among the 15 Largest Transit Agencies Note: Each line represents the largest transit agency in the metro region. Some regions may have multiple agencies. Source: National Transit Database

Sometime around 2013, bus ridership across much of the country began to decline. It dropped in Washington, in Chicago, in Los Angeles, in Miami. It dropped in large cities and smaller ones. It dropped in places that cut service, and in some that invested in it. It dropped in Sun Belt cities where transit has always struggled to compete with the car, and it dropped in older Eastern cities with a long history of transit use.

By late 2019, through nearly seven straight years of decline, national bus ridership in America was at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, a trend that has left service already weakened as transit agencies brace for a public health crisis.

The bus started to lose ground many decades ago as Americans bought cars, suburbanized and spread out. But the timing of this recent free fall has been more perplexing. The economy was strong in this period, meaning more people had jobs to commute to. And many of these metro areas have been growing in population Ã¢ÂÂ that means more commuters, too.

What has been happening then, across all of these places, at the same time?

The answer probably lies deep in a number of trends: the rise of on-demand technology, the changing nature of work, the evolution of e-commerce, the redevelopment of city centers, the influx of young professionals, and the suburbanization of the poor. Many seismic shifts in urban life are reflected in this one datapoint Ã¢ÂÂ the broad decline of bus ridership.

Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of societal change thatÃ¢ÂÂs not necessarily connected,Ã¢ÂÂ said Eric Lind, the research and analytics manager with Metro Transit, which serves Minneapolis and St. Paul. Ã¢ÂÂBut it all points in the same way to fewer rides.Ã¢ÂÂ

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs worrisome both for the remaining riders and for cities that will need strong mass transit to meet their climate goals.

In Minneapolis, bus ridership began declining in 2014 and has fallen by 26 percent. Some bus trips appear to have shifted to a newly opened light rail line. But Uber and Lyft have expanded in the city over this same time. Bike commuting has increased. The transit agency has also detected an uptick in car ownership in neighborhoods historically well served by buses. And in a strong economy, Metro Transit struggled to replace a generation of retiring bus operators, hampering service. Workers have simply had more options, as agencies around the country have found.

Mr. Lind suspects another demographic shift at play: Older people are traditionally a reliable pool of bus riders. But baby boomers aging into retirement now are the first generation to have spent their entire lives in a world dominated by cars. Unlike their parents, Mr. Lind suggested, baby boomers were never transit riders. They donÃ¢ÂÂt remember riding the streetcar. They donÃ¢ÂÂt have muscle memory of what itÃ¢ÂÂs like to take the bus.

Researchers at Georgia Tech who have been studying the decline of bus ridership have found another demographic clue. Kari Watkins, a professor of civil engineering, and Simon Berrebi, a post-doctoral fellow, compared bus-stop data going back to 2012 in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Miami and Portland, Ore., four notably different areas where transit agencies automatically count passengers as they board the bus.

Falling ridership in Atlanta, Miami, Minneapolis and Portland, Ore.

In Miami and Atlanta, neighborhoods with more college-educated residents had steeper declines in bus ridership. And one demographic pattern appeared across all four cities: Whiter neighborhoods have been losing the most ridership.

Ã¢ÂÂThat made us think, Ã¢ÂÂWhat are the changes in the behaviors of people who are white?Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Mr. Berrebi said.

He and Ms. Watkins believe they may be taking greater advantage of new alternatives to the bus, like Uber and Lyft or bike-sharing. Other research shows that bike-sharing has eaten into bus ridership (while surveys in some cities report that bike-sharing riders skew highly educated and white).

Studies have been less conclusive on the effect of ride-hailing companies, in part because their user data hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been accessible to researchers. But preliminary findings from a continuing project through the Transportation Research Board show that the largest declines in transit ridership at the metro level can be attributed to the introduction of ride-hailing services. And in the largest cities, ride-hailing has affected buses more than rail.

Mr. Berrebi and Ms. Watkins also suggest that white and more educated residents may have more access to flexible or remote work in an environment where the nature of work is shifting for everyone.

Ã¢ÂÂWe donÃ¢ÂÂt go to work in the same way that we traditionally have,Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Watkins said. Ã¢ÂÂWeÃ¢ÂÂre doing it at more odd hours. More people are teleworking now. All of this is morphing in ways such that Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm going to buy a monthly transit passÃ¢ÂÂ is kind of disappearing.Ã¢ÂÂ

The Georgia Tech research raises a provocative question: If whiter neighborhoods are losing the most bus trips, what will happen in neighborhoods that grow whiter over time? Gentrification typically doesnÃ¢ÂÂt move fast enough to be detected in the data that Ms. Watkins and Mr. Berrebi studied (although they did see some evidence of ridership declines, particularly in Miami neighborhoods that have grown whiter).

But in some cities it is hard to imagine that shifting demographics wonÃ¢ÂÂt affect bus use, particularly as higher-income residents Ã¢ÂÂ the very riders who have the most options Ã¢ÂÂ move into dense neighborhoods well covered by transit, and as poorer residents who rely on transit the most move farther out.

In Atlanta, demographic patterns are changing faster than the ability of public transit to keep up, said Jacob Tzegaegbe, the lead transportation adviser in the mayorÃ¢ÂÂs office.

Ã¢ÂÂOne of my personal fears is the suburbanization of poverty,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to serve places that donÃ¢ÂÂt have density. And it's really hard to do it in a way thatÃ¢ÂÂs cost-effective.Ã¢ÂÂ

For several decades, Atlanta neglected its bus system as it invested in rail instead, said Jeffrey Parker, the C.E.O. of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. Then competition suddenly appeared from ride-hailing, electric bikes and scooters. The redevelopment of close-in neighborhoods also means more people can walk to work. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a good thing. But it can further erode bus ridership.

Add in the growth of e-commerce, and now streets are further congested with delivery trucks, slowing buses even more. And quick trips to the store that bus riders once took are no longer being made.

Ã¢ÂÂIt feels like the world is changing faster than it was five years ago, even faster than it was a couple of years ago,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Parker said.

And much of this is outside of his agencyÃ¢ÂÂs control: the development patterns, the demographic change, the rise of Amazon and Uber.

Ã¢ÂÂWhat do they control? They control providing service every day, and operating that service,Ã¢ÂÂ said Paul P. Skoutelas, the C.E.O. of the American Public Transportation Association. Ã¢ÂÂThey donÃ¢ÂÂt control the streets. They donÃ¢ÂÂt make the regulations and the rules about who gets what street space and where people are dropped off and picked up.Ã¢ÂÂ

Agencies donÃ¢ÂÂt control all the infrastructure and subsidies that help transitÃ¢ÂÂs biggest competitor, the car. Past research has suggested that transit riders are even more sensitive to changes in gas prices than they are to changes in transit fares. Recently gas has been cheap, and interest rates on auto loans low. In many cities, the price of urban real estate has risen, but not the price of street parking.

Michael Manville, a professor of urban planning at U.C.L.A., suspects that the rise of Craigslist has fundamentally altered the market for used cars, too, making them easier to find and cheaper to buy. That may be one reason why car access has risen.

In California, it's also possible that transit ridership has been affected at the margins by a state law granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. As immigration falls in general, Mr. Manville said, that could shrink another reliable pool of bus riders.

Even riders who once seemed to have few options to the bus increasingly do.

Ã¢ÂÂIf you build it in a way where only those without a choice would ride it Ã¢ÂÂ and as soon as they have any choice they jump Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs not really a transportation system youÃ¢ÂÂre building,Ã¢ÂÂ said Beth Osborne, the director of the advocacy group Transportation for America.

The answer, Mr. Manville said, would be to make the true costs of driving more apparent Ã¢ÂÂ picture congestion pricing, higher parking rates, higher gas taxes Ã¢ÂÂ while giving some of the carÃ¢ÂÂs structural advantages to buses instead.

Ã¢ÂÂAt the end of the day, we may never know what is driving this decline,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Manville said. Ã¢ÂÂBut I guarantee you that if you took a lane of Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles and gave it only to the bus, ridership would go up.Ã¢ÂÂ

In Washington, where nearly all of these forces are apparent, the City Council is considering giving residents $100 a month to use on transit. The proposal, from a city councilman, Charles Allen, would be paired with a fund dedicated to improving bus service, particularly in poorer neighborhoods. The transit subsidy, however, wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be means-tested, available only to poorer residents. It would go to everyone, ignoring the distinction between riders who have many other options and those who have few.

Ã¢ÂÂIf you believe public transit is a public good, like I do, then you donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test it,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr. Allen said. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test your road. I donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test building your sidewalk. I donÃ¢ÂÂt means-test building your bike lane.Ã¢ÂÂ

HeÃ¢ÂÂs also trying to build a broader constituency for bus service, because that is probably what it would take to accomplish things like taking lanes of traffic from cars and dedicating them to buses instead. The few cities that have bucked the declining ridership trends, like Seattle, have managed to do that. In the cities that havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet, bus riders are at risk of becoming a smaller and smaller group, moving even slower.",The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"Many seismic shifts in urban life are reflected in this one datapoint Ã¢ÂÂ the broad decline of bus ridership.

And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

Ã¢ÂÂThe downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,Ã¢ÂÂ said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the CouncilÃ¢ÂÂs health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving Ã¢ÂÂreports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,Ã¢ÂÂ said ScarsdaleÃ¢ÂÂs school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday.

511,https://us.cnn.com/travel/article/cell-phone-calls-airplanes/index.html,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ Ah, holiday travel . Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.

Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.

The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.

Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.

Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.

""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""

Keeping cabins calm

Flight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock

Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.

Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.

Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.

Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.

""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES.""

Flight attendants' opposition is significant.

They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.

On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.

Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.

""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.

""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""

Passengers advocating for quiet

Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.

Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.

Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.

""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""

Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.

Business travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.

Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.

""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""

One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.

This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.

Is the technology safe?

Newer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers' technology. Shutterstock

The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.

In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.

Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.

The rise of smartphones changed everything.

As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.

Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.

Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.

Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.

""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.""

""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""

Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.

Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.

""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""

Regulatory, practical obstacles

Texting is already permitted on some airlines. Shutterstock

Though it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.

First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.

The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.

""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.

Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.""

The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.

Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.

Who calls people anyway?

What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.

Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.

""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""

Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.

596,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/health/friday-13-superstition-conversation-wellness-scn/index.html,"(CNN) The number 13, black cats, breaking mirrors, or walking under ladders, may all be things you actively avoid -- if you're anything like the 25% of people in the US who consider themselves superstitious.

Even if you don't consider yourself a particularly superstitious person, you probably say ""bless you"" when someone sneezes, just in case the devil should decide to steal their soul -- as our ancestors thought possible during a sneeze

Superstition also explains why many buildings do not have a 13th floor -- preferring to label it 14, 14A 12B or M (the 13th letter of the alphabet) on elevator button panels because of concerns about superstitious tenants. Indeed, 13% of people in one survey indicated that staying on the 13th floor of a hotel would bother them -- and 9% said they would ask for a different room

On top of this, some airlines such as Air France and Lufthansa, do not have a 13th row . Lufthansa also has no 17th row -- because in some countries -- such as Italy and Brazil -- the typical unlucky number is 17 and not 13.

What is superstition?

Although there is no single definition of superstition , it generally means a belief in supernatural forces -- such as fate -- the desire to influence unpredictable factors and a need to resolve uncertainty. In this way then, individual beliefs and experiences drive superstitions, which explains why they are generally irrational and often defy current scientific wisdom.

Psychologists who have investigated what role superstitions play, have found that they derive from the assumption that a connection exists between co-occurring, non-related events. For instance, the notion that charms promote good luck, or protect you from bad luck.

For many people, engaging with superstitious behaviors provides a sense of control and reduces anxiety -- which is why levels of superstition increase at times of stress and angst. This is particularly the case during times of economic crisis and social uncertainty -- notably wars and conflicts. Indeed, researchers have observed how in Germany between 1918 and 1940 measures of economic threat correlated directly with measures of superstition.

Touch wood

Superstitious beliefs have been shown to help promote a positive mental attitude. Although they can lead to irrational decisions, such as trusting in the merits of good luck and destiny rather than sound decision making.

Carrying charms, wearing certain clothes, visiting places associated with good fortune, preferring specific colors and using particular numbers are all elements of superstition. And although these behaviors and actions can appear trivial, for some people, they can often affect choices made in the real world.

Superstitions can also give rise to the notion that objects and places are cursed. Such as the Annabelle the Doll -- who featured in The Conjuring and two other movies -- and is said to be inhabited by the spirit of a dead girl. A more traditional illustration is the Curse of the Pharaohs, which is said to be cast upon any person who disturbs the mummy of an Ancient Egyptian person -- especially a pharaoh.

Numbers themselves can also often be associated with curses. For example, the figure 666 is a number some believe to be associated with the devil, and is often featured in stories of misfortune or curses

Sporting superstitions

Superstition is also highly prevalent within sport -- especially in highly competitive situations. Four out of five professional athletes report engaging with at least one superstitious behavior prior to performance . Within sport, superstitions have been shown to reduce tension and provide a sense of control over unpredictable, chance factors.

Superstition practices tend to vary across sports, but there are similarities. Within football, gymnastics and athletics, for example, competitors reported praying for success, checking appearance in mirror and dressing well to feel better prepared. Players and athletes also engage with personalized actions and behaviors -- such as wearing lucky clothes, kit and charms.

Famous sportspeople often display superstitious behaviours. Notably, basketball legend Michael Jordan concealed his lucky North Carolina shorts under his Chicago Bulls team kit. Similarly, the tennis legend BjÃÂ¶rn Bork, reportedly wore the same brand of shirt when preparing for Wimbledon.

Rafael Nadal has an array of rituals that he performs each time he plays. These include the manner in which he places his water bottles and taking freezing cold showers. Nadal believes these rituals help him to find focus, flow and perform well.

Walking under ladders

What all this shows is that superstitions can provide reassurance and can help to reduce anxiety in some people. But while this may well be true, research has shown that actions associated with superstitions can also become self-reinforcing -- in that the behavior develops into a habit and failure to perform the ritual can actually result in anxiety

In his public post that went viral, Zuckerberg wrote: ""We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way. You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience.""

Zuckerberg's frank admission of his wife's three miscarriages led to a vast outpouring of stories from women and families who have faced a similar situation.

Millennials have become accustomed to posting their lives online, and yet, as they are coupling and starting families they are discovering that few experiences are as isolating as losing a desired pregnancy.

Somewhat ironically, the main flaw with this earnest film built around a directionless character is its lack of a clear objective.

Buying into the premise requires a bit of leeway to get started: During high school, Davidson's Zeke dated the older sister of Mo (Griffin Gluck), and remained his pal after they broke up. Now Mo's a 16-year-old high school student -- with all the attendant insecurities -- and Zeke, at 23, mostly enjoys getting high and playing video games.

That the two remain near-inseparable seems odd to, well, pretty much everyone, perhaps especially Mo's dad (Jon Cryer). Yet the family tolerates the situation, which will gradually have pretty significant consequences (foreshadowed in a pre-credit sequence) as Mo's budding adolescence runs into Zeke's Peter Pan-like case of arrested development.

For Davidson, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star whose off-screen life is generally more interesting than his on-screen contributions, Zeke certainly offers an easy transition to movies, though the central focus is actually Gluck, whose struggles with all the usual teen troubles are complicated by Zeke's been-there advice and generally bad influence.

Mo insists Zeke is ""a nice guy once you get to know him,"" but his cavalier attitude -- toward everything from his retail job to relationships -- doesn't always make him the most sterling counselor. That includes his suggestion that Mo become the source of booze and pot for a circle of ""friends"" that not surprisingly mushrooms after learning that he can supply them.

(CNN) For students at colleges and universities across the United States, coronavirus is bringing a new layer of uncertainty as classes are moved online and some students are being told to move out. Harvard University and Amherst College are among the latest institutions to ask their students to move out or not return after spring break.

Jill Filipovic

It's an understandable decision, given that schools with high numbers of students living in shared quarters on campus -- attending group lectures and labs, and eating together in the dining halls -- are perfect petri dishes for disease.

But many of these same schools have also been trying to recreate themselves as instruments for equality, expanding need-based financial aid and offering need-blind admissions so that anyone who qualifies, regardless of family wealth, can enjoy the huge step up that schools like Harvard confer.

But it's these same students who may get caught in the coronavirus response crosshairs.

As it stands, many schools do not yet offer a clear public plan for how to handle students who can't go home: those whose homes are in affected countries, those who are low-income and rely on financial aid for their housing, those whose homes don't offer space conducive to learning (not every home in America, let alone the world, has the fast WiFi connection necessary for online classes), those who may not have a bed or place to stay in their childhood homes, and those who support themselves and don't have homes to go back to.",Coronavirus decisions creates big burden for college students,"Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book ""The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.""

779,https://us.cnn.com/travel/article/olympic-games-tourism-legacy/index.html,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ At the forefront of the photo, a diver leaps into azure Spanish skies, arching her body into a streamlined curve.

In the background, a panoramic Barcelona skyline stretches out, punctuated by La Sagrada Familia, Gaudi's half-finished masterpiece of a cathedral, and fringed by distant hills.

This incredible shot was first captured by British photographer Bob Martin in the lead up to the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, and matched later by photographer Simon Bruty, for Getty Images, in the lead gallery picture above.

Over the course of the Olympics' two-week stint in Barcelona, variations on this eye-catching scene were broadcast on television screens around the world, cementing a spectacular image of the Spanish city in the memories of millions.

The result? Barcelona arrived squarely on the tourism map, transforming from an undiscovered gem to a must-visit European destination: in 1990, there were just 1.7 million overnight visitors, by 2016, there were over 8 million.

Sure, during that time the Spanish city also benefited from the growth of budget flights, a booming cruise industry and increasing word of mouth reports of its many cultural highlights -- but many reckon the successful Olympic stint is what kickstarted the uptake.

But while tourists still flock to Barcelona's MontjuÃÂ¯c area to see the view that the Olympics made famous, across the Mediterranean in Greece, many of the venues that were once the glory of Athens 2004 lie seemingly semi-abandoned and forgotten.

They're not alone: In China, some of Beijing's 2008 Olympic venues have been absorbed by nature, weeds growing inside what was once the BMX track.

With a new Olympic city in the spotlight every couple of years, the short-term tourism opportunity and long-term tourism legacy promised by hosting the Games is alluring.

But the threat of populating your city with ""white elephant"" venues that serve no purpose post-Games is increasingly disconcerting. Early this year, concerns were raised about the safety of Rio's 2016 Olympics Park, with a judge even ordering its closure

So why do Olympic venues sometimes get abandoned? And how do cities ensure a positive Olympic legacy for both tourists and locals?

Building an Olympic city

The Summer Olympics are one of the world's biggest sporting events, and, unsurprisingly, building an Olympic city is no easy feat.

It all starts with a would-be host submitting a bid, outlining how they intend to get their Games off the ground, and how they'll transform their city into a sporting playground.

""These days you need somewhere between 35 and 40 athletic venues to just host the required games for the Olympics,"" explains Andrew Zimbalist, Robert A. Woods professor of economics at Smith College in Massachusetts, and the author of several studies on the economics of the Olympic Games.

Some of the Olympic venues from Athens 2004 have not fared well. Milos Bicanski/Getty Images

""On top of that, you need an Olympic village that will house somewhere in the neighborhood of 18,000 people, you need a media village that also requires beds for several thousand people.""

In short, it takes a lot of space and a lot of venues.

In that sense, says Zimbalist, a city getting saddled with white elephants post-Olympics is perhaps more likely than not.

""Ask yourself the question, if a city did not have a economically justifiable reason to have a facility the day before the Olympics began, why would they have an economically justifiable reason to have the facility 18 days later, after the Olympics ends, or after the Paralympics, a month and a half later, ends?"" the economist tells CNN Travel.

In recent years, bidding cities have tried to circumnavigate this issue by planning ahead, devising ways to successfully transform into an Olympic city, and successfully transform back again, whether via temporary venues, or converting pre-existing apparatus.

This isn't just cities being inventive -- nowadays it's pretty much mandated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), who oversee the Games and the bidding process.

In 2013, the IOC adopted its Olympic Agenda 2020 reform program, seeking to make the games more sustainable and to ""keep up with the changes in our current world."" The new program stipulates that the venues do not need to be permanent, or new, and costs do not need to be astronomical.

""Image building is extremely powerful,"" says Christophe Dubi, executive director of the IOC. ""But you need a plan. That's what we gauge now, in the dialogue [with host cities.]""

Making the bid

Why a destination bids to host an Olympics Games is dependent upon its individual economic, social, cultural and historical factors.

""Cities bid for the Olympics for geopolitics reasons, for media branding reasons, for sponsorship, to track foreign direct investment and talent and so on,"" says Tony Johnston, head of Tourism at Althone Institute of Technology in Ireland.

While tourism might not be the motivating factor for bidding, hosting a mega event puts your city on show, on a global scale. And such high stakes have, for a long while, come hand-in-hand with high prices.

Take the Canadian city of Montreal, which hosted the Summer Olympics in 1976, and reportedly only stopped paying off its Olympic debt three decades later . Or Sochi, in Russia, which took on the 2014 Winter Olympics amid plans to spend upwards of an eye-watering $50 billion.

Andrew Zimbalist, Robert A. Woods professor of economics at Smith College Ã¢ÂÂIf a city did not have a economically justifiable reason to have a facility the day before the Olympics began, why would they have an economically justifiable reason to have the facility 18 days later, after the Olympics ends?Ã¢ÂÂ

Some city populations have expressed concerns about the mounting costs. Boston, in the US, and Hamburg, in Germany, withdrew their respective bids for the 2024 games. Boston made the decision after polls indicated a lack of support, while Hamburg pulled out of its bid following a citywide referendum in which 51.6% of residents said they were against the idea.

""We are encouraging the organizing committees to find solutions that are cheaper if they do exist,"" Dubi tells CNN Travel. ""And we really embrace that spirit of creativity, innovation in order to contain the costs.""

Dubi says he's confident prices are becoming more restrained.

He also adds that the importance of planning for legacy is true of any major sporting event.

""We are permanently dialoguing with future hosts for 2030, 32, 34 etc,"" adds Dubi. ""What is your long term plan in terms of development for the city and the region? And how can the Games contribute? You have to have a strong plan and the Games as a contributor to make it a success.""

London as a case study

In 2012, right before the Olympic Agenda 2020 was adopted, London hosted the Summer Olympic Games. This Olympic stint didn't offer Barcelona levels of tourism transformation -- perhaps because, as economics and environmental studies expert Victor A. Matheson jokingly put it: ""The Olympics aren't going to put London on the map because if London isn't already on your map, you really need to get yourself a new map.""

But London's Games did try and prepare for a post-Olympics future. How successfully the city did so depends on who you ask.

The London Legacy Development Corporation was formed a couple months before the 2012 Olympics, with the aim of using ""the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of the London 2012 Games and the creation of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to develop a dynamic new heart for east London, creating opportunities for local people and driving innovation and growth in London and the UK.""

Peter Tudor, the corporation's director of visitor services, recently showed CNN Travel around the London Aquatics Centre, the swanky water palace purpose-built for the London Olympics' swimming, diving and synchronized swimming events.

It's been a public pool since 2014. On a rainy winter weekday, it was teeming with activity -- from school kids crowding the entryways to serious swimmers doing laps beneath the undulating roof.

""The London Olympics was probably one of the first times people were really thinking about what happens after the Games, lots of cities got to the end of their Games and then asked the question,"" says Tudor.

The Aquatics Centre cost ÃÂ£269 million to build, and underwent a lengthy, pricey, transformation process to become a public space.

It still hosts official events from time to time: the FINA Diving World Series is scheduled to take place here in March 2020, followed shortly after by the British Swimming Championships.

But for some east Londoners, it's just their local gym -- even if UK Olympian Tom Daley can occasionally be seen catapulting off the diving board.

London's Olympic Park is based in Stratford, in the east of the city, a historically poorer, industrial area. Part of the London Olympic bid was a promise to regenerate this part of the British capital.

The city's then-mayor, Ken Livingstone, said the Olympics was ""the only way to get the billions of pounds out of the government to develop the East End -- to clean the soil, put in the infrastructure and build the housing.""

There's certainly been a lot of housing built here, pre and post-2012. There's still more development to come as part of the still-in-the-works East Bank development , including planned east London offshoots of the Victoria and Albert Museum and Sadlers Wells Theatre.

Additionally, in the post-Olympic years, London's stadium has become a soccer hub for London football team West Ham United. The ArcelorMittal Orbit tower -- a piece of public art designed to symbolize the triumph of the Olympics -- doubles up as a slide and viewing platform.

Still, this transformation didn't come cheap. The London Stadium was originally pitched at ÃÂ£280 million ($358 million at today's exchange rates) -- its final construction cost was ÃÂ£486 million, and converting it into a venue suitable for West Ham cost an additional ÃÂ£272 million.

And naysayers question whether there was a need for a super fancy helter-skelter, or huge new stadium. Plus, they say, the East End area of the city had been pegged for regeneration whether or not the Olympics came to town.

""If the [British] government had simply provided incentives to encourage that development, then you would have would have gotten much more authentic and organic and deep economic development in that area then anything that you might have gotten from the Olympic construction,"" says economist Zimbalist.

Londoner Julian Cheyne used to live in a housing estate called Clays Lane, knocked down in 2007 to make way for the Olympic Park. Cheyne is the co-founder of a site called GamesMonitor, that views the Olympic project through a critical lens.

""If you are a part of the property industry, then you can make a lot of money out of projects associated with the Olympics,"" Cheyne tells CNN Travel. ""And it means that you get the opportunity to remove people from areas of land which you might have your eye on.""

Cheyne was rehoused and received monetary compensation, but he says he had ""no desire to move.""

He is, in fact, skeptical that the Olympics have any sort of positive impact on tourism.

""It's very difficult to think of any particular benefits that London has had as a result of the Olympics. It was a well known city. It didn't need this boost in order to get tourists to come to it.""

""I'm not really a fan of the Olympics at all, I don't think that these major events contribute anything to the cities, apart from a degree of destruction to largely poor neighborhoods,"" says Cheyne.

The London Legacy Corporation, however, argues the city's Olympics, and ongoing legacy has largely boosted the lives of locals and tourists.

Peter Tudor points to a series of recent high profile sporting events as one example: in 2019, the London Stadium played host to two Major League Baseball (MLB) games between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The matches were part of a two year arrangement for MLB to play season matches at the city's stadium -- this year will see the St. Louis Cardinals take on the Chicago Cubs.

The 2019 series added a reported nearly ÃÂ£37 million ($48.1 million) to the London economy . Fifteen percent of the fans who attended were from the United States, 10% were international tourists from elsewhere. Meanwhile, 65% of attendees traveled from other places in the UK.

The IOC, says Tudor, likes to recommend prospective bidders come and visit the London venues -- to see how legacy building is done.

""We show other nations delegations round on a fairly frequent basis,"" he explains.

Unexpected tourism

When it comes to an Olympic tourism uptake, almost three decades after divers were filmed catapulting through Barcelona's skyline, the Spanish city's still most often held up as an example of the Olympics' power to transform a city's tourism fortunes for the better.

It's not the only one, though. Turin, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006, also saw a boost: Visitor numbers in Piedmont increased from 3.3 million in 2006 to 4.3 million in 2012.

Another Winter Olympics success story is Salt Lake City, Utah, which hosted in 2002.

Utah, once second-fiddle to Colorado as a ski destination, had its profile raised thanks to the Olympics, explains economist Victor Matheson. The exposure led to an increase in the number of skier visits in Salt Lake City (and surrounding area), and more rapid growth than neighboring Colorado, Matheson says.

These success stories might have staying power in the public consciousness, but so too do the abandoned venues; stories on these spots make headlines, populate Instagram and Flickr and inspire think pieces.

While on paper abandoned Olympic infrastructure might seem like a waste, a failure to capitalize on Olympic legacy, oddly, such venues can become a tourist attraction of their own -- albeit a niche, and possibly even illegal-to-visit one.

The popularity of ""ruin porn"" -- artsy photographs of abandoned venues -- can send photographers flocking to the graffiti-strewn bobsled tracks of Sarajevo, or Athens' disused venues.

The IOC, meanwhile, is keen to stress that the venues which appear abandoned sometimes have more to them than meets the eye.

""We are conscious that some venues from past Games are not utilized as fully as they could be,"" says Bernardo Domingues, media relations manager at the IOC.

""However, too often we see outdated or out of context reports or images of venues from past Games that do not represent the current situation or account for the full picture.""

Christophe Dubi, executive director, International Olympic Committee Ã¢ÂÂThe one message that I really insist upon is that we have turned the page, Games bidding and Games organization has been really totally revampedÃ¢ÂÂ

The IOC points to Beijing's often-photographed BMX track, saying it was always intended as a temporary facility, and photos of the cities Canoeing and Rowing Park, which it says do not demonstrate the facility's full use.

In Rio, the issue, says Dubi, is that temporary venues haven't been dismantled.

Domingues says the IOC is currently conducting a research study looking at the post-Games use of all existing Olympic venues, with results due in early 2021.

Not everything's been perfect in the past, the organization admits, and it says it's learning from this -- pointing to the new Olympic Agenda 2020 reform program.

""The one message that I really insist upon is that we have turned the page. Games bidding and Games organization has been really totally revamped,"" says Dubi.

Olympic future

The mission of the modern Olympic Games is to build bridges between countries and celebrate connections -- and offer a stellar fortnight of sporting greatness.

This mission is predicated on the idea that the Olympics sets up shop in a different city every couple of years, opening the world's eyes to the wonders of that particular destination.

Still, some experts suggest that to eradicate fears of disused venues, and as a way of addressing the increasingly fervent question of sustainability, the IOC should abandon the bidding system altogether.

The proposed alternative? A few cities alternate hosting duties at purpose-built, permanent venues. Andrew Zimbalist calls this concept, ""the only sensible plan,"" while Matheson, while admitting that it's not 100% in the spirit of the Olympics, says he would ""vote in favor of that -- and in a heartbeat.""

The IOC, however, is more interested in an alternative idea that's already being put into practice: giving the Olympic Games a larger footprint -- that is, a region, or even entire country hosting, rather than one city.

The 2026 Winter Olympics, for example, is due to be hosted by Italian cities Milan and Cortina.

And while Tokyo's initial plan for 2020 was to construct new venues on the islands surrounding Tokyo Bay, this idea was rejigged to instead reuse venues from the Games in 1964, build temporary structures that will be dismantled post-Games, and utilize existing structures further afield.

There are 12 venues that are located over five miles from the Olympic village HQ.

This plan comes with an added tourism bonus, as more of the country will be spotlighted.

""We've learned over the past that ultra-compact Games, although they are very good from an operational stand point, they do not necessarily equate to a good legacy,"" says Dubi.",The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games,"With a new Olympic city in the spotlight every couple of years, the short-term tourism opportunity and long-term tourism legacy promised by hosting the Games is alluring.

Type ""When did women start..."" into Google and one of the top autocomplete suggestions to pop up is, ""When did women start shaving?""

The answer goes back centuries. Hair removal -- or otherwise -- has long shaped gender dynamics, served as a signifier of class and defined notions of femininity and the ""ideal body.""

However, in its most recent evolution, body hair is being embraced by a growing number of young women who are turning a source of societal shame and turning it into a sign of personal strength.

The rise of gender fluidity, the body-positivity movement and the beauty sector's growing inclusiveness have all contributed to the new wave of hirsuteness.

""It's been deeply stigmatized -- it still is -- and cast with shame,"" said Heather Widdows, professor of global ethics at the UK's University of Birmingham and author of ""Perfect Me: Beauty as an Ethical Ideal,"" in a phone interview. ""Its removal is one of the few aesthetic traditions that have gone from being a beauty routine to a hygienic one.

""Today, most women feel like they have to shave. Like they have no other option. There's something deeply fraught about that -- though perceptions are slowly changing.""

From ancient Egypt to Darwin

Hairlessness wasn't established as a mandate for women until the early 20th century.

Before that, removing body hair was something both men and women did -- as far back as the Stone Age, then through ancient Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire -- using seashells, beeswax and various other depilatories. In these earlier eras, as Victoria Sherrow writes in ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History,"" hairlessness was seen mostly as a way to keep the body clean. Ancient Romans also associated it with class: The smoother your skin was, the purer and more superior you were.

In the Middle East, as well as East and South Asia, threading was used on the entire face. But unibrows were actually considered alluring for both sexes, and were often accentuated with kohl.

In Persia, hair removal and brow-shaping was a marker of adulthood and marriage for women, and was mainly reserved for that occasion. While in China, body hair was long considered normal, and even today woman face far less social pressure to shave.

The same goes for other countries in Asia: While hair removal has become routine for many of the continent's young women, waxing or trimming pubic hair, for instance, isn't as common as it is in the West.

In fact, in Korea, pubic hair was long considered a sign of fertility and sexual health -- so much so that, in the mid-2010s, it was reported that some Korean women were undergoing pubic hair transplants, to add extra hair to their own.

Europeans weren't always obsessed with hair-free skin.

In the Middle Ages, good Catholic women were expected to let their hair grow as a display of femininity, while keeping it concealed in public. The face was the only place where hair was considered unsightly: 14th-century ladies would pluck the hair from their foreheads in order to push back their hairlines and give their faces a more oval appearance. When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558, she made eyebrow removal fashionable.

By the late 18th century, hair removal still wasn't considered essential by European and American women, although when the first safety razor for men was invented by French barber Jacques Perret in 1760, some women reportedly used them too.

It wasn't until the late 1800s that women on both sides of the Atlantic started making hair removal an integral part of their beauty routines. The modern-day notion of body hair being unwomanly can be traced back to Charles Darwin's 1871 book ""Descent of a Man,"" according to Rebecca Herzig's ""Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.""

Darwin's theory of natural selection associated body hair with ""primitive ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier, 'less developed' forms,"" wrote Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College in Maine. Conversely, having less body hair, the English naturalist suggested, was a sign of being more evolved and sexually attractive.

As Darwin's ideas became popularized, other 19th-century medical and scientific experts began linking hairiness to ""sexual inversion, disease pathology, lunacy, and criminal violence,"" Herzig continued. Interestingly, those connotations were applied mostly to women's body hair, not men's -- not just because of evolutionary arguments but also, the author pointed out, the enforcement of ""gendered social control"" on women's rising role in society. Making women think they had to be hairless to be considered worthy of attention was a heteronormative way of controlling their bodies -- and, inherently, their selves -- through shame, Widdows explained.

By the early 1900s, upper- and middle-class white America increasingly saw smooth skin as a marker of femininity, and female body hair as disgusting, with its removal offering ""a way to separate oneself from cruder people, lower class and immigrant,"" Herzig wrote.

A female 'necessity'

In the first decades of the 20th century, changing fashions -- sleeveless dresses exposing the skin -- further popularized body hair removal in the US.

In 1915, Harper's Bazaar was the first women's magazine to run a campaign dedicated to the removal of underarm hair (""a necessity,"" as it was described). That same year, men's shaving company Gillette launched the first razor marketed specifically for women, the Milady DÃÂ©colletÃÂ©e. Its advert read, ""A beautiful addition to Milady's toilet table -- and one that solves an embarrassing personal problem.""

The shorter hemlines of the 1930s and '40s, and a shortage of nylon stockings during World War II meant more and more American women began shaving their legs, too. The introduction of the bikini in the US in 1946 also led shaving companies and female consumers to focus on the trimming and shaping of their nether regions.

In the 1950s, as Playboy hit the newsstands (its first issue came out in 1953), clean-shaven, lingerie-touting women set a new standard of sexiness. By 1964, 98% of American women aged 15 to 44 were regularly shaving their legs. Wax strips and the first laser hair removal also debuted around then, though the latter was quickly abandoned for its damaging effects on the skin before being reintroduced decades later.

""And yet shaving was far from being as extreme as it is today,"" Widdows said. ""In the late 1960s and 1970s, full bushes were not at all uncommon, even in Playboy. Around that time you also had the second wave of feminism and the spread of hippie culture, both of which rejected hairless bodies. For a lot of women, body hair was symbol of their fight for equality. It wasn't seen as unnatural -- not yet.""

That shift, Widdows said, kicked off in the following decades, with the rising popularity of waxing, pornography and increasingly explicit pop culture. In 1987, seven sisters from Brazil (known as the J Sisters) opened a salon in New York City offering the so-called ""Brazilian"" -- a complete wax hair removal of the genital region. Celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Campbell started doing it. The masses followed suit.

""Removing body hair went from being 'expected' to the norm,"" Widdows explained. ""Being hairless has come to be seen as the only 'natural' and clean way to present the body. Except it really isn't.""

With advertising and media further promoting the ideal of hair-free bodies, the idea that female hair is gross has only grown. In turn, methods to achieve hairlessness have become more precise: The last four decades have seen the ascent of electrolysis, pulsed light and more advanced laser technology.

""Anything associated with the 'abject' -- what we expel from our cultural worlds in order to define ourselves -- arouses disgust, shame and hostility almost by definition,"" Herzig told CNN in an email. ""Visible female body hair certainly tends to be treated as abject today. It's worth noting that those are ideas about cleanliness, contingent social norms, rather than about actually removing 'dirt.' Most hair removal practices tend to introduce new opportunities for abrasion and infection.""

Embracing hairiness

In 2008, Breanne Fahs, professor of women and gender studies at Arizona State University, set female students an assignment to grow their body hair and write a paper reflecting on the experience. Fahs later extended the assignment to include the course's men, who were asked to shave their legs. The project still runs today.

""The assignment has spotlighted the cultural inevitability of female hair removal,"" Fahs said in a phone interview. ""Over the years, those who have taken part in it have shared quite consistent issues: a deep sense of shame, struggle with self-confidence, even social ostracism.

""There have also been cases of heterosexism and homophobia -- this idea that growing your leg hair automatically implies you're queer, or shaving it means you're a gay man. Women often don't realize how much society, family and friends weigh in on what we do with our bodies. And how much of what we think is a choice -- that 'I choose to shave' -- has actually been imparted to and enforced upon us for generations.""

But Fahs also saw feelings of empowerment, rebellion and anger stirring from the project. ""Particularly in the last two years, in the wake of the election and the #MeToo movement -- there's been a deeper awareness of the restrictions surrounding women's bodies, of feminism, gender and sexuality, and a willingness to push back against it all, or at least break out of the comfort zone,"" she said.

It's not just Fahs' students.

A new cohort of young women is embracing body hair, especially on Instagram. The phenomenon has also made it into magazines. In the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, actress Emily Ratajkowski posed with unshaven underarms (a full 360-degree turn for the publication since its early anti-armpit hair messages). YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen and musician Halsey have also showed off their body hair.

Newly launched women's shaving brands are also making a case for female fuzz, and encouraging positive conversations around the topic. The Flamingo razor, from the popular grooming line Harry's, emphasizes the right to choose whether to shave with ad slogans like ""No Waxation Without Representation"" and ""We Are Grow Choice.""

ed diverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness. Direct-to-consumer razor start-up Billie , established in 2017, is another company that's marketing the idea of choice. Rather than showing the perfectly smooth models typical of female shaving ads, its campaigns depictdiverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness.

""For so long, advertising has only reinforced the taboo around the subject,"" said Billie co-founder Georgina Gooley in a phone interview. ""We wanted to actually acknowledge that women have body hair, show it, and say that shaving is a choice. If you want to keep your body hair, we celebrate that. And if you want to remove it, that's fine as well.""

Photographer Ashley Armitage, who worked on the Billie campaigns and artfully depicts body hair on her Instagram account , agrees. ""Body hair is a personal choice,"" she wrote in an email. ""Shaving it, waxing it, or growing it are all valid options, and all up to the individual.""

The idea that not shaving can be a choice may not seem revolutionary, when it comes to normalizing body hair. But it could be an important step towards reframing the issue.

""I think more women are realizing how body hair is deeply connected to gender and power,"" said Fahs. ""The emotional nature of what body hair elicits in people has tremendous potential as a tool for activism and social change.""

325,https://us.cnn.com/2017/04/26/americas/brazil-amazon-slavery-freedom-project/index.html,"Arapoema, Brazil (CNN) -- In this small town on the edge of Brazil's somewhat lawless agricultural frontier, streets turn to mud under tropical rains and laundry hangs limp in front of cement-box houses.

There's one bank and two churches. But for most folks here, if you want a job, you have to head to one of the nearby cattle ranches - only recently carved out of the steamy Amazon jungle.

Luiz Cardoso da Silva, a 69-year-old ranch hand, has worked on half a dozen. But he hopes to never go back.

""I want to spend more time here at home, maybe line up a little something close to my family. There would be nothing better than that,"" says Seu Luiz, as he is known.

On a recent Saturday, Seu Luiz and several of his children crowded into their kitchen for plates of rice, beans and fried liver. The women perched on rustic wooden chairs in the one-room house and the men squatted out back.

""Anybody who's been in the leopard's mouth is real happy right here,"" Seu Luiz said.

'Treated like animals'

Just three days earlier, Seu Luiz was sleeping on the floor of a cattle corral, surrounded by fetid mud.

He and six relatives had been living and working on the ranch for two years, building fences and weeding pastures. There was no bathroom, just a single outdoor spigot to shower and wash clothes and dishes. Nearby bushes served as a toilet.

JUST WATCHED Family forced to live with cattle on Brazilian ranch Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Family forced to live with cattle on Brazilian ranch 04:59

That's how they were found when an eight-car convoy, lights flashing, pulled into the ranch. One of the Brazilian mobile units tasked with cracking down on worker exploitation across the country was following up on a tip.

Marcelo Goncalves Campos, a veteran inspector for the Labor Ministry, shook his head as he took notes.

""I've been an inspector for almost 20 years and this is really one of the worst cases I've seen,"" he said. ""They are being treated, without any exaggeration, like animals. Sleeping in the same corral as the cattle.""

Seu Luiz tells inspectors that they haven't received any money for the last two years. He says the ranch owner provides them with food, deducts it from their wages and claims that they ended up owing him money.

""You can't leave because you owe money for the food he's given you, you have a debt."" He says he was afraid for the safety of his family if he left.

Debt bondage is common in Brazil's lawless cattle country, according to the coordinator of this latest operation, Andre Wagner, also from the Labor Ministry.

""You'll see someone working in degrading conditions, with an exhausting work schedule, eating one meal a day, while they don't receive any form of salary or a very small one, because their food and tools are discounted,"" he says.

An uphill fight

In fact, more than 50,000 workers have been rescued from what Brazil defines as slave-like conditions since the mobile units were created in 1995. A third of them came from ranches.

But it's an uphill fight with roughly 25,000 Brazilians lured into slavery every year, according to the Catholic Pastoral Land Commission, or CPT. They also end up working in coalmines, sugar cane fields, urban construction sites and garment factories.

Brazil's resources for fighting exploitation are limited. The number of mobile units - comprised of inspectors, prosecutors and federal police - has fallen to four from eight just a decade ago.

""Our method for fighting slavery is good, but we have very few inspectors,"" says Wagner. ""When the complaints are received at our headquarters in Brasilia, we can't go immediately. The delays mean the conditions might have changed.""

The delays are often five or six months, he says.

'Nobody deserves to live like this'

In the case of Seu Luiz, it's a recent tip - just two weeks old.

On the day the mobile unit shows up, the ranch owner is nowhere to be found and doesn't answer his phone. That makes it hard for them to secure an immediate payout for workers.

But the inspectors gather evidence that can be used in negotiations or an eventual trial, setting up an impromptu office on a patio at the ranch. They log hours of interviews and investigate the owner's assets.

Wagner says financial compensation averages about $2,000 for exploited workers but when the conditions are extreme, it can be 10 times that.

The first priority, however, is removing the family from the ranch.

Maria Dalva Sousa, 18, had been living with her husband and toddler son in a shack on the edge of the corral.

""I just want to get out of here, nobody deserves to live like this,"" she says. ""Look at this mud, only rats can sleep in a place like this.""

Together, they all roll up a couple of foam mattresses, stuff clothes into cardboard boxes and load a stove onto the back of a police pick-up truck. After two years of grinding work on the ranch, these are their few possessions of value.

Cattle country

In northern Brazil, cattle roam the rolling pastures.

Huge swaths of the Amazon rainforest were cut down to create these ranches. At first, farmers were encouraged by the government to settle the land. Then they seized more territory illegally.

The famous grass-fed beef produced on these ranches is a staple at home and an important export for Brazil, accounting for $4.35 billion in revenues in 2016.

Few consumers suspect that extreme labor exploitation is an ingrained part of this culture.

But Xavier Plassat, a French Dominican friar, has dedicated his life to fighting what he calls modern-day slavery in the region.

""The main point about slavery is that someone wants to make a profit with zero cost,"" he says. ""Here, more than anywhere, it is easy to make a profit with zero cost. You are on the frontier of farming, of ranching.""

JUST WATCHED Friar battles labor explotation in Brazil Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Friar battles labor explotation in Brazil 04:31

Plassat, 66, works with the Pastoral Land Commission, coordinating their national campaign against labor exploitation.

He has a network of agents and informants who talk to ranch-hands and send reports of labor abuses to federal authorities. Initially, their tips lead to about a quarter of the mobile unit raids.

This has gotten some of the church activists killed - most notably Dorothy Stang, the American-born nun who was shot and killed in 2005.

""I don't say we want to be martyrs,"" Plassat says. ""But we try to be present to share the suffering and help the workers.""

French Dominican friar Xavier Plassat.

'Impunity, greed, vulnerability, misery'

Plassat shows us a safe house run by the Pastoral Commission where workers who have been rescued by the mobile units can eat and sleep while they fight for compensation.

He says conditions have improved in the region, but says modern-day slavery is far from being eradicated.

""Slavery is a system and it has several roots: impunity, greed, vulnerability, misery. If you don't address all of it at the same time you will probably have the same persons coming back to the same cycle of enslavement,"" he says.

He is concerned that Brazil could actually be sliding backwards on the issue.

An increasingly powerful rural lobby in the national congress has pushed to relax the country's very broad definition of slave labor while the resources to fight it have shrunk.

One of the main tools used to shame employers into compliance has also been undermined - every year the Labor Ministry publishes a ""Dirty List"" of companies caught exploiting workers. But recently, its publication has been repeatedly blocked or delayed.

Return to slavery?

For Seu Luiz, good news finally comes. The ranch owner's family has agreed to pay the equivalent of $38,000 in back wages and penalties for pain and suffering - to be divided among the seven workers.

Seu Luiz says he'll use it to move out of the one-room house he rents and finally buy a home of his own. Something he hopes will protect his children in the future.

In the meantime, a federal prosecutor has filed criminal charges against the ranch owner. Those charges are currently being reviewed by a judge.

487,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/chicago-mob-harry-caray-steakhouse/index.html,"Chicago (CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ At first glance, the building looks like others in downtown Chicago. Home today to Harry Caray's Steakhouse, its exterior is punctuated by a bright neon sign; for fans of Major League Baseball and the restaurant's namesake, this is a destination.

The restaurant walls are covered in MLB memorabilia and photos of everyone who's visited, from the likes of actress Mila Kunis to former US President Barack Obama.

Though celebrities have graced these hallways the last few decades, there's a deeper and darker history within these walls. If these walls could speak, they'd tell the tale of many a mob operation during the Al Capone era.

Built in 1895, the building sits on Chicago's very first designated block; now one of more than 20,000.

In that time, it's passed through multiple, often notorious owners and lived even more lives. It's been a museum for taxidermy animals, a bootlegged liquor distribution center and housed illegal slot machines.

During Prohibition, it became a speakeasy owned by one of Al Capone's cohorts, Gustav Muller. The location held a dual purpose back then. It was kitty corner to the Cook County Courthouse, which according to the Chicago Tribune, was a frequent haunt for the unwilling Capone.

When Capone's reign of the Chicago underworld came to an end in 1931, his influence did not.

His right-hand man turned mob boss, Frank Nitti, a mobster known by the nickname The Enforcer, bought the building in 1939 and continued to use it to distribute liquor. The fourth floor became Nitti's home.

Every floor of this four-story building has secrets.

The current owners of Harry Caray's Steakhouse have been unearthing these secrets since taking over the building in 1987. More than three decades later, bricked-in walls are still giving way to hidden safes in the bowels of the building.

At basement level, it's eerily quiet. Dark and dusty tunnels run the length the building, leading to what current restaurant owner, Grant DePorter, says was once Chicago's vast underground tunnel system.

It's in the same maze of rooms where DePorter discovered a safe, which once cracked open, contained Frank Nitti's phone book -- a veritable trove of information on all those in positions of power in Chicago at the time.

DePorter's latest discovery, which was made in 2018, is a box behind a bricked-in wall. It's one he has yet to excavate, but aims to do so soon. According to him, drilling holes and taking out bricks can be tricky.

Few other designers have been as influential as Giorgetto Giugiaro in shaping modern automobiles. In a career spanning 64 years he has designed some of the most successful and influential cars in history, ranging from one-of-a-kind exotics to mass market utility vehicles.

He's designed over 200 cars for manufacturers around the world which collectively put over 60 million cars on the road and -- at the age of 81 -- is still working today. Having sold his design practice Italdesign in 2015, he continues to design, now with his son Fabrizio, under the roof of a new firm called GFG Style.

This is the 1969 Alfa Romeo Iguana concept, one of the cars that Giugiaro used as an inspiration for the design of the DeLorean a decade later, along with his 1970 Porsche Tapiro concept.

Birth of a legend

Born in 1938 in Garessio, about 60 miles South of Turn, Giugiaro came into the world at the prime time and place for a young boy who would eventually become a gifted designer. Fiat, Italy's flagship automaker, was an hour's drive away and the country's post-war economic boom would coincide with Giugiaro's coming of age. In fact, Giugiaro joined FIAT as early as he possibly could -- when he was just 17 -- but not because he was eager to draw cars.

""I got involved with cars not out of passion, but as a part of my creative process,"" he said in a phone interview from his studio in Moncalieri, just outside Turin.

The Giugiaros were a family of artists and Giorgetto was supposed to pursue a similar path. His father, however, noticed that he had a more technical inclination, and so allowed him to go to art school by day and study technical design in the evenings.

Dante Giacosa, FIAT's technical director, saw some of his car sketches and hired him as a junior designer. ""I joined FIAT in 1955 to have an experience outside of the arts world, not really knowing where it would lead to. This experience was more valuable than a school and gave me confidence to experiment with my creativity.""

After four formative years at Fiat, Giugiaro's work was noticed by Nuccio Bertone, who ran one of several influential coachbuilding ateliers that had sprung up around Turin at the time, including Ghia, Pininfarina and Vignale. Bertone's firm made its name by styling beautiful cars for other manufacturers, and put Giugiaro at work on some forward-thinking projects.

""In 1960 I saw my first prototypes come to life at Bertone: The Gordon-Keeble GT, the Alfa Romeo 2600 and the Giulia GT, which I finished as I was drafted for the then obligatory military service. I was 22.""

After creating cars at Bertone under badges such as BMW, Mazda and Ferrari, Giugiaro switched jobs again in 1965, joining Bertone's competitor Ghia. There, he designed two of his most beautiful cars, the Maserati Ghibli and the De Tomaso Mangusta.

The Mangusta went on to become a minor icon among sports car enthusiasts, although only around 400 were produced. Its passenger doors open normally, the design features gullwing doors for the engine and luggage compartment, a truly unique styling quirk. It's Bill's car in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2,"" it features in the film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and in Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" music video.

The Italdesign era

In 1967 , aged 29 but with 12 years of work experience, Giugiaro started his own design firm, Italdesign, and moved heavily into mass produced cars, shaping some of the world's most successful people movers. As a designer, this is the type of work he preferred. ""The mass-produced car, as a project, has many variables, including timing, costs, feasibility, directors, marketing -- the creative aspect isn't hard, but the mediation between all these variables is. That makes it more gratifying,"" he said.

""The hedonistic car, the car that everybody wants but nearly nobody can have, is a lot easier do to, because it's created for publicity, it doesn't have to rely on a complex structure.""

In 1974 he was asked to design the successor of the Beetle for Volkswagen. The resulting first generation Golf -- known as the Rabbit in the US -- debuted Giugiaro's ""origami period,"" a new styling sensibility dominated by sharp, angular lines. It would influence car design for generations, and create one of the most resounding success stories in the automotive world: The Golf, currently in its seventh generation, is still the undisputed leader in its sector, with sales to date in excess of 30 million units.

Despite his growing fame, Giugiaro kept a low profile. ""When Volkswagen asked me if I wanted to have a badge on every Golf they built that read 'design by Giugiaro,' I said 'No, thanks.' It would have cost me more to send them thousands of badges every day than the money I got from the entire project! When people buy a car, they don't generally care about who designed it. Cars are not artworks. Art is prestigious, but cars are not.""

Movie icons

Giugiaro applied his sharp-edged, origami style to cars that were meant for wildly different purposes and markets.

In 1976 he designed the Esprit for English automaker Lotus, which became James Bond's car in the following year's ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" famously transforming into a submarine. The very car that was used for the film's underwater scenes was purchased by Elon Musk in 2013 for nearly $1 million.

Shortly after, Giugiaro styled the DeLorean, a 2-door coupe launched in 1981 that was consigned to immortality when Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale picked it as Marty McFly's car for ""Back to the Future"" in 1985. Giugiaro based the DeLorean on the Tapiro, a 1970 concept car he had created for Porsche. It was similarly wedge-shaped and, most importantly, sported a stainless steel body with gullwing doors.

""I didn't expect that it could be picked as a movie car,"" he said. ""Its unpainted look is due to the fact that DeLorean didn't want to spend anything on painting equipment, so he went with stainless steel, but that didn't come without problems. I'm glad when someone remembers that I designed it.""

Around the same time, during a fruitful collaboration with Fiat, he designed the two affordable and compact cars of the 1980s for the Italian automaker: the well-known Uno and the Panda.

With its brutally basic design, Giugiaro's Panda was the opposite of a bedroom poster car in its heyday, but it's now attracting a cult following, the ""4x4"" version especially. In a 1980 interview to Italian newspaper La Stampa, Giugiaro described the Panda as ""a pair of jeans: a simple, practical, no-frills piece of clothing."" He likened the design to that of a military helicopter: ""a light, rational machine designed for a specific purpose.""

More than cars

Giugiaro's designs extend beyond the automotive industry thanks to an industrial design division of Italdesign, launched in 1974. Since then he's designed the Nikon F5 camera trains for the Riyadh metro, a professional coffee machine , a dentist chair, several Beretta guns, sewing machines, watches, tractors, motorbikes and the stadium for Turin's football team Juventus FC, and perhaps the most unexpected -- a pasta shape called Marille.

""These were a great way to fill the dead times between car projects -- but the creative process and technique are exactly the same as a car, there's no difference. It's more liberating, because it lets me escape the normative hell of cars, which are full of rules and regulations,"" said Giugiaro.

Today, Giugiaro is no longer involved with Italdesign, after Volkswagen -- through its subsidiary Audi -- first acquired 90% of its shares in 2010 , then the remaining 10% in 2015 . But he's still designing cars: One of his latest creations, presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2018 in celebration of his 80th birthday, is an electric concept named Sybilla (after his mother, Maria Sibilla).

Whenever he sees one of his own creations on the road, he has a simple thought: ""I notice what I could have done better. I'm always thinking about the future, about doing what I couldn't have done before. So, in a way, I'm constantly working even when I'm not working.""

There is, however, something he would have liked to design but never got the chance to: ""I love the design of modern fighter jets and even space ships that you see in the movies. I would have enjoyed designing a plane.""

(CNN) On March 8, International Women's Day, and as 2020 marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, there are many reasons to celebrate the global progress that has been made on gender equality. Regrettably, this hard-earned progress is being openly challenged. We, the Nordic Prime Ministers, wish to express our grave concern over the current pushback against women's and girls' rights. We have witnessed a surge in regressive policies around the world, often undermining universal human rights.

The Nordic countries' success in promoting gender equality is a result of targeted government policies and strong civil societies, but it is also deeply rooted in international legal frameworks. We therefore wish to reiterate our joint commitment to the protection and promotion of the rights of women and girls, and more generally of universal human rights.

For over 40 years, the Nordic countries have worked collectively to promote gender equality. This has resulted in stronger economies and happier and more prosperous societies. Key public policies include the provision of well-paid, shared parental leave, and universal, affordable, and high-quality child care. When implemented properly, these policies enable women to participate in the labor market and public decision-making processes, while making space for men to share domestic responsibilities. This has positive impact on gender equality at work and at home, and also leads to greater gender equality in public decision-making and a better gender balance among leaders. The private sector must be a part of this. Increasing women's participation and ensuring more diverse leadership have proven not only to be the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do.

However, despite the remarkable progress that has been made, gender-based structural inequalities are still evident across the region. As in other countries, the discrimination multiplies when gender intersects with other protected characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability. As an example, unemployment among women born in countries outside the EU/EEA remains higher than among other groups.

Overall, gendered trends persist in the Nordic labor markets. The majority of teachers and care workers are women, and men are more likely to work in the transport, construction and manufacturing sectors. Men are also overrepresented in leadership positions.

(CNN) The hilariously inept attack on the Washington Post by an organization run by right-wing prankster James O'Keefe -- his latest in a catalog of failures, falsehoods and fraud -- is a ""worst practices"" list of things a true news organization should never, ever do.

O'Keefe has spent years attempting to expose alleged liberal bias in mainstream media organizations, which, in and of itself, is a worthy goal.

97,https://us.cnn.com/2020/02/25/health/most-polluted-cities-india-pakistan-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) India has once again topped an annual list of cities with the worst air quality in the world, according to a new report, while Chinese cities have continued to show improvements from the previous year.

Twenty-one of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India, according to data compiled in IQAir AirVisual's 2019 World Air Quality Report, with six in the top ten.

Ghaziabad, a satellite city of the capital New Delhi in northern Uttar Pradesh state, is ranked as the world's most polluted city, with an averagePM 2.5 concentration measurement of 110.2 in 2019. That's far more than double the level which the US Environmental Protection Agency regards as healthy -- it's nine times more.

And in November, a public health emergency was declared after the air quality index (AQI) level exceeded 800 in certain parts of New Delhi, which was more than three times the ""hazardous"" level.

Researchers from IQAir -- a global air quality information and tech company -- gleaned data for the report from on the ground monitoring stations that measure levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, per cubic meter.

The microscopic particles, which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are considered particularly harmful as they are small enough to enter deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system.

PM 2.5 includes pollutants such as sulfate, nitrates and black carbon. Exposure to such particles has been linked to lung and heart disorders and can impair cognitive and immune functions.

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths a year globally, mainly as a result of increased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory infections.

It is estimated that more than 80% living in urban areas which monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle-income countries most at risk.

""Air pollution constitutes the most pressing environmental health risk facing our global population,"" the AirVisual report said.

South Asia continues to be of particular concern, with 27 of the 30 most polluted cities in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. Pakistan's Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Raiwind, are among the ten most polluted cities, and the major population centers of New Delhi, Lahore, and Dhaka rank 5th, 12th and 21st respectively, according to AirVisual data.

Regionally, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are worst affected overall, with only six of 355 cities included meeting WHO annual targets, the report said.

However, South Asia has seen improvements from the previous year. National air pollution in India decreased by 20% from 2018 to 2019, with 98% of cities experiencing of varying levels of improvement. The report points to economic slowdown, favorable weather conditions, and efforts towards cleaning the air as reasons behind the decrease.

For example, the most polluted city, Ghaziabad, had an average AQI of 110.2 this year. But in 2018 it was 135.2 and 144.6. in 2017.

The report also points India's launch of the country's first National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) which aims to reduce PM 2.5 and the bigger particulate PM 10 air pollution in 102 cities by 20-30% by 2024 compared to 2017 levels.

Climate crisis and urbanization

The air quality data shows, ""clear indications that climate change can directly increase the risk of exposure to air pollution"" the report said, noting it impacts air quality in many cities through desertification and increased frequency of forest fires and sandstorms.

Greenhouse gas emissions , with the burning of fossil fuel a key driver of the climate crisis, is also a major cause of dirty air.

Many countries are still dependent on coal for their energy production, the biggest contributor to PM 2.5 emissions. China, for example, is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal.

Exacerbating the problem is rapid urbanization in industrializing Southeast Asian cities, which is also a major cause of air pollution and poses severe challenges to managing PM 2.5 levels, the report found.

Indonesia's Jakarta and Vietnam's Hanoi overtook Beijing for the first time among the world's most polluted capital cities, ""in a historic shift reflecting the region's rapid industrialization,"" the report said. The two capitals have annual PM 2.5 levels which are about 20% higher than those of Beijing, according to the report.

""Fast growing cities need to make a choice if they want to grow in a sustainable manner,"" said Yann Boquillod, director of air quality monitoring at IQAir.

However, it's not all bad news. People power is bringing about change, he said.

""Up to recently, growth was more important than the environment, but we're seeing a very clear trend that people are demanding more from their local governments,"" Boquillod said.

""During the year 2019, citizens of Hanoi have massively become aware of the air quality in their city, thanks to the deployment of air monitors. This is an example how air quality data has helped to push government to improve the environment.""

And in the past year residents of Jakarta have sued the government over worsening air pollution in the city.

Jakarta is Southeast Asia's most polluted city and the fifth most polluted capital -- up from 10th position in 2018, according to the report. It's on track to become the world's biggest megacity by 2030, with a population of 35.6 million, according to a 2018 Euromonitor report.

""The city's rapid growth has coincided with heightened PM2.5 levels, as the growing population adds to its notorious traffic congestion, and coal-based energy demand,"" the AirVisual report said.

Bright spots

Chinese cities have overall seen marked improvements in recent years, with average concentrations of pollutants falling 9% from 2018 to 2019, according to the report.

China's capital Beijing has more than halved its annual PM 2.5 levels over the past decade and has dropped out of the world's 200 most polluted cities following concerted efforts to get air pollution under control.

However, 98% of Chinese cities still exceeded WHO guidelines and 47 feature among the top 100 most polluted cities in the 2019 World Air Quality Report

Dust and sandstorms in the desert city of Hotan, in western China's Xinjiang region, make it the world's second most polluted city in 2019, with an average AQI of 110.1.

Another positive is that last year saw a significant increase in countries expanding their air quality monitoring, ""with the number of monitoring stations increasing by more than 200% since the year prior.""

More monitoring data is important to inform communities about the quality of the air they are breathing and helps tackle air pollution globally, the report said.

Continuous public air quality data is now available for the first time for Angola, the Bahamas, Cambodia, DR Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Latvia, Nigeria and Syria, the report found.

Yet there is still a large gap in air quality data for many parts of the world, the report said, meaning the total number of cities exceeding the WHO PM 2.5 threshold could be higher.

For example, Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people, has less than 100 monitoring stations that make air quality data available to the public in real time.

""Often locations bearing the highest particulate pollution levels tend to also notably have the least monitoring data,"" said Frank Hammes, CEO of IQAir.

1074,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/opinion/corona-virus-trump-susan-rice.html,"In 2014, President Barack Obama founded the Global Health Security Agenda to rally developed countries to help many of the least-developed countries build their capacities to detect, contain and combat diseases before they spread widely. Under President Trump, much of the funding for the C.D.C., United States Agency for International Development and other agencies for that and related initiatives was cut.

As Mr. ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs national security adviser, I established the office of Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council to monitor, prepare for and prevent global health crises. In 2018, my successor dismantled the office, pushed its leader, Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, out and downgraded the position of Homeland Security adviser. During the transition in January 2017, the Obama team provided briefing papers and conducted a side-by-side exercise with leaders of the incoming Trump administration focused on pandemic threats. Like much of the assistance we offered, it was discarded by the incoming team.

Second, consistent with his nationalistic, xenophobic orientation, Mr. Trump has portrayed the virus that causes Covid-19 as a Ã¢ÂÂforeign virus.Ã¢ÂÂ In reality, viruses know no nationality and respect no borders. Demonizing foreigners, denigrating people of different religions and hues, building walls and restricting immigration are not effective ways to combat a pandemic. Nor do they solve our economic challenges or assuage those uncomfortable with our growing racial diversity.

No American lives have been saved by blaming China for the origin or spread of the virus. A containment strategy predicated on keeping certain foreigners out, if swiftly and properly executed, might have bought American authorities some time to prepare for the inevitable domestic outbreaks, but it could never prevent the emergence of such a highly transmissible disease. Unfortunately, whatever time might have been gained by halting most travel from China was not used to speed domestic preparedness.

In the same vein, Mr. Trump just announced a counterproductive and ineffectual suspension of travel from much of Europe. By refusing to consult or even warn our closest allies, the United States alienated partners whose cooperation we always need to confront global challenges, including the coronavirus. Moreover, the virus is already prevalent across the United States, and its magnitude will only grow. Mr. TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs arbitrary travel ban on Europeans, which inexplicably excludes Britain and Ireland, is rife with as many holes as Swiss cheese. Merely another feckless, if costly, way of blaming foreigners for our own problems, it does nothing to address the crisis already in our midst.","Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus, but There Is Still Time","Under President Trump, much of the funding for the C.D.C., United States Agency for International Development and other agencies for that and related initiatives was cut.

Two sisters who had experienced ""honour hate"" in their community are to work to raise awareness of it in schools.

Amaleehah and Nadia Aslam-Forrester, from Bristol, were targeted by members of the Asian community for posting photos of themselves in skirts online.

The sisters, who have a Pakistani mother and English father, said they were ""slut-shamed"" for not upholding cultural norms of women's behaviour.

They are now working with a charity to educate young people about the issue.

So-called honour crimes are acts that have been committed to protect or defend the supposed honour or reputation of a family and extended community.

Amaleehah Aslam-Forrester, 22, said the pair had always been creative and would use Instagram to express their love of art, modelling and clothes.

However, they faced a backlash online for the photographs because of what they said were ""deeply ingrained cultural pressures"".

Image copyright Amaleehah Image caption Amaleelah said the ""hate messages"" they received were ""awful""

Their social media presence also alarmed their mother.

Worried about their safety, she put the sisters in touch with Integrate, a youth-led charity in Bristol which has campaigned for gender and racial equality and been supported by Sport Relief.

They attended a series of workshops with other young women about issues including female genital mutilation, sexism and honour-based violence and eventually made a film about the issue.

Amaleehah said: ""In our community, honour lies within the body of a woman.

""There's always pressure on her to uphold men's honour in her behaviour and also in the way she dresses.

'Hate messages'

""We had one case where someone told us to drink bleach [on social media].

""We got a lot of hate messages. Some people were anonymous, making fake accounts. It was awful.

""And that was all because we were being judged, there was stereotyping involved.""

She said ""slut-shaming"" in general was about women's honour and there is no culture in society that does not experience some form of this.

437,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/business/mcdonalds-marion-gross-risk-takers/index.html,"If you've eaten a McDonald's Quarter Pounder recently, you may have noticed that it tastes better than it used to.

It may seem like a simple, obvious decision: Fresh beef gets hotter faster and tastes juicier, delivering a more appetizing burger. Through consumer insights, McDonald's knew that their customers would respond well to the upgrade. And the improved burgers could help McDonald's better compete with its rivals. So-called ""better burger"" chains like Five Guys and Shake Shack have gained traction, raising the bar for mainstream outlets. And the success of fast casual joints like Chipotle and Panera has pushed larger chains to switch to fresher ingredients.

But it took about three years to make the change, and Marion Gross, chief supply chain officer for McDonald's in North America, initially balked at the idea.

""I think I said, 'Not while I'm in this job,'"" Gross told CNN Business's Rachel Crane. She was particularly concerned that introducing a new ingredient Ã¢ÂÂ which has to be handled in a new way Ã¢ÂÂ into McDonald's complex supply chain could also accidentally introduce new risks to food safety in restaurant kitchens. She was skeptical because ""of the enormity of the change that had to be made.""

Gross is responsible for nearly $14 billion in food, equipment and packaging and oversees more than 15,000 restaurants in North America, including roughly 14,000 locations in the United States. The company's supply chain is the mechanism that enables those restaurants to sling burgers, fries and beverages to millions of people every day. It's a carefully calibrated system that includes suppliers, distributors, franchise operators and other stakeholders. Even small changes require a great deal of planning and consideration Ã¢ÂÂ and convincing everyone involved that it's worth making the change. Any tweak to the system increases the likelihood of something going wrong.

Gross, who stepped into the role in 2013, said that a former chair of the McDonald's board once called the company's supply chain a ""daily miracle.""

What he meant, Gross said, is that nobody notices when the supply chain is working properly. But they notice when it breaks down. ""The only time that supply chain even sort of hits anybody's radar is when something goes wrong,"" she said.

Making a change to one of McDonald's signature menu items is particularly risky Ã¢ÂÂ especially if that change could introduce food safety concerns.

From dream to reality

By mid-2015, McDonald's was in a rough spot. Visits to restaurants were down , and same-store sales Ã¢ÂÂ which measure the sales at locations open around a year Ã¢ÂÂ had been down for two years running. The company decided to close 350 underperforming restaurants globally, which was a rare contraction

""Simply speaking, we need to be better at serving hot, fresh food,"" said then CEO Steve Easterbrook during a July 2015 call with analysts.

So the company's leadership set to work on turning the business around. Those efforts included tapping people across the company for ideas on how to make better food.

That year, McDonald's franchise operator Joe Jasper met with chefs, suppliers and McDonald's corporate employees from its business insights and menu marketing teams, among others. That ""food journey"" team, about 20 people altogether, was tasked with figuring out a way to make McDonald's burgers the best among all quick-service restaurants.

During its first brainstorming session, the group came up with the idea for a hotter, juicier burger, Jasper said. But they didn't land on fresh beef right away.

When Jasper, who at the time owned and operated 20 McDonald's locations in Texas, returned to his team, he brainstormed with them, as well. They agreed that if possible, fresh beef in a Quarter Pounder ""would be amazing.""

So he set to work. Along with two others, Jasper spent three days in one of his kitchens, working about eight to ten hours each day.

The goal was to cook up a hot, juicy burger without making major changes to the kitchen's operating system and without slowing down the drive thru. With those parameters in mind, Jasper and his team had to deliberate over every detail Ã¢ÂÂ from the width and thickness of the patty to the amount of pressure cooks use to sear the burger without drying it out.

""You change one parameter and it changes everything, and so you have to test over and over and over again,"" Jasper said. A few one-off successes weren't enough, he added. ""You have to do something you can replicate. When you start doing the math, it's millions of times a day across our system.""

Once Jasper had figured out how to make the new ingredient work, he invited Gross Ã¢ÂÂ a sponsor of his food journey team Ã¢ÂÂ to one of his restaurants to try it out. When she tasted the fresh beef burger, Gross said, she went from being ""a skeptic to a believer.""

But others remained skeptical.

When McDonald's first started testing out its fresh beef burger in 2016, some franchisees reportedly said they were against the switch. One operator worried about ""an uncaring employee doing something that puts the entire system at risk,"" CNBC reported , citing a survey of about 27 franchisees who together owned and operated roughly 200 restaurants. They pointed to Chipotle, which took a major financial and reputational hit after E. coli outbreaks at its restaurants sickened customers, as a cautionary tale.

""We are the lightning rod,"" the franchisee said, according to CNBC. ""Chipotle will be a walk in the park if we have an incident.""

Franchisees own and operate about 93% of McDonald's restaurants, so getting them on board with the idea was crucial to its success.

Focus on safety

Franchise operators weren't the only ones worried about food safety. That was Gross's main concern about making the switch, too.

""I lost a couple of winks of sleep over that one,"" she said.

Fresh beef is not inherently more difficult to prepare than frozen. But there are important differences between how fresh and frozen meat needs to be handled. Cooks must be mindful of contamination when handling fresh beef Ã¢ÂÂ basically, they need to make sure that raw burger juice doesn't end up in other food or ingredients.

For employees, the new ingredient meant re-learning a skill that may have become second nature, Gross said. ""For years they were used to following the same procedures, and probably most of them could do it in their sleep,"" she noted. ""This was a big change.""

With the guidance of a third-party food safety expert, McDonald's put new practices into place. It instructed employees to wear blue gloves when handling the fresh beef, to make sure that other food products weren't accidentally contaminated. Members of the corporate team made sure that employees at McDonald's thousands of US restaurants had been trained correctly before the launch.

To prepare a fresh beef burger, employees take the patty from the fridge and place it directly on a flat iron grill. While it's cooking, the cook adds a pinch of salt and pepper to bring out flavor. The fresh burgers cook more quickly than frozen ones.

Changes also had to be made on the supply and distribution side.

Suppliers, used to sending frozen patties to McDonald's, needed new packaging equipment and refrigeration capacity, among other things, to make sure the fresh beef was handled safely.

Lopez Foods was the first supplier to sell fresh beef to McDonald's. In order to accommodate the new product, Lopez had to build new lines. That meant new grinders and packaging equipment, among other tools. It converted one of its freezers into a refrigerator to store the meat. Switching from fresh to frozen also means Lopez has to be more nimble with its shipments. With a frozen product, they could plan far in advance for McDonald's promotions that would increase the number of orders. With a perishable product, that planning time shrinks.

And Lopez had to make all of these investments up front, with no guarantee that the changes would yield results.

""It's a big change for us, it's a big change for the restaurant operationally. And there were questions around whether that could be executed,"" said Ed Sanchez, CEO of Lopez Foods. ""I had doubts along the way. But as it progressed along, it was less and less doubt. And there came a point to where it was crystal clear that we had to do this. The customer wanted it.""

Fresh beef has a shorter shelf life than frozen, noted Dale Rogers, professor of logistics and supply chain management at Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business. This means that it needs to be brought from the suppliers to McDonald's more quickly than frozen beef.

Technological innovations, like sensors, can help make it easier for McDonald's to ensure that the beef has been kept at the right temperature throughout its journey, said Rogers. Years ago, it would have been more difficult for McDonald's to make sure that the meat is properly refrigerated all the way through.

Still, it's a major overhaul, he said. But If anyone can pull it off, it's McDonald's.

""It's a very disciplined culture,"" he said. ""McDonald's has had the same suppliers for many, many years,"" he added. ""The relationship is extremely tight."" When it comes to managing its supply chain, ""McDonald's is one of the best of the best,"" said Dale.

To get suppliers on board, Gross started small.

""A lot of that up front was really just getting people comfortable with the idea of a change this big, a move this bold for a company with our scale and our size,"" Gross said.

Gross initially balked at the idea of switching to fresh beef because of the massive changes it would require of the McDonald's supply chain. But after a taste test, she changed her mind. (Taylor Glascock for CNN)

After getting Lopez Foods on board, ""it was time to bring on the next supplier,"" said Gross. ""We had all this learning from Lopez Foods that could very quickly be shared with supplier number two. Then they brought their production lines up and going, and they had a bunch of learning as well.""

Sanchez is pleased with the results of the switch, he said. ""We were satisfied with our investment and our return on investment,"" he noted, adding, ""it grew the business for us.""

Getting its suppliers to work together is a ""competitive advantage,"" said Gross. ""Their interests, like ours, is in the success of the McDonald's system.""

Constant improvement

With its roughly 14,000 US locations and $38.5 billion in 2018 US sales , McDonald's far outpaces its competition. Wendy's, the next biggest burger chain according to QSR Magazine's most recent annual list , closed out 2018 with about 6,700 locations and nearly $10 billion in US sales. Burger King's 7,300 US locations also pulled in about $10 billion in US sales in 2018.

With McDonald's so far ahead, it doesn't really need to worry about the competition, noted Sam Oches, editorial director of Food News Media at QSR magazine. What it does have to worry about is staying relevant.

""You still want your customers to choose McDonald's over Wendy's and Burger King, but you also want your customers to choose McDonald's over Five Guys,"" Oches said.

Better burger and fast casual chains started gaining momentum after the 2008 recession, when people were looking for spots that served higher quality meals than fast food chains but were less expensive than casual restaurants. By 2015, both the fast casual and better burger trends were well established. And burger chains like Wendy's and In-N-Out, which built their reputations on serving fresh beef, were shouting out their message.

""The more that the mass audience is hearing these stories about fresh beef and better burgers, the more that old frozen patty really wasn't going to cut it,"" said Kara Nielsen, a food trend expert based in Oakland, California.

McDonald's has experimented with high-quality and craft burgers, but pricey options haven't worked well for the brand. And complicated burgers may add to prep time, which can mean longer lines and wait times in stores.

Still, McDonald's could have skipped this trend because of its massive scale.

Speaking at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in May 2018, Easterbrook, still CEO of McDonald's at the time, explained why it was so important to figure out a way to improve the chain's burgers.

""We're a burger business at our heart,"" he said. ""If you want to really get the core business growing day in, day out, what changes can you make to the items you sell most of that customers would value?"" By making it's thickest burger, the Quarter Pounder, hotter and juicier, McDonald's can give customers the most bang for their buck.

The fast food chain is constantly trying to improve its menu. ""That includes enhancing or improving, making our iconic burgers and product offerings better too,"" Gross said, noting that making the shift to fresh beef ""was probably the most difficult change that we made since we made the move to all day breakfast.""

For now, the risk is paying off. ""The customers are voting by coming in and visiting us more often,"" said Gross.

""It all goes back to listening to the customer, and what the customer wants, and how their needs and wants are changing,"" she said. ""Then us being able to demonstrate that number one, we're listening to them. Number two, we're taking action and we're making the moves that are important to them, even with our iconic food product.""",How McDonald's made the switch to fresh beef,"McDonald's began serving Quarter Pounders made with fresh beef in its US stores in May 2018.

These nocturnal urban landscapes, glistening in purple and indigo hues, may well look like a patchwork of different cities, mixed together to create the ultimate sci-fi metropolis.

But they are, in fact, single exposure images taken from a rooftop in the Australian city of Melbourne -- then simply flipped upside down.

""They really look like they're composites of lots of images, but they're just one single shot and all I've done is turn them 180 degrees,"" said photographer Tom Blachford in a phone interview.

""I was amazed at the first image I took, I just couldn't believe how much it looked like this crazy collage of some dystopian future world. And I got really fascinated with how rotating an image could completely change its composition, completely break your brain's way of looking at it.""

Tom Blachford

Blachford, who's from Melbourne, said the images are inspired by the works of Dutch artist M.C. Escher, famous for his mind-bending experiments with perspective and optical illusions, as well dystopian sci-fi films like ""Blade Runner"" -- depicting a futuristic Los Angeles under perennial night-time rain -- and ""Akira,"" a Japanese animated film from 1988 that has become a cult classic.

""There's quite a few scenes in 'Akira' where the city is upside down that they just don't explain. The city just flips for no reason -- I love that it's sort of in the background and nobody notices,"" said Blachford.

Tom Blachford

The images were all shot from the top of a building in central Melbourne. A crucial component was the absence of wind. ""You need a really still night, because doing long exposures on a tripod, 55 floors up, any wind is going to be massively amplified and it's going to shake your camera around,"" said Blachford.

The colors in each image are then corrected in post-production. ""Everything's very stained with neon, with colors, it was about restricting the color palette and doing a color treatment and grade on it that pushed things towards more of a purple, magenta and blue kind of spectrum.""

Tom Blachford

The series includes eight images, which are being exhibited in Melbourne, where some people have struggled to recognize their own city. ""Most people think that this is a continuation of my Tokyo series , even people who live here think that these are images from Tokyo,"" Blachford said. ""It's been really interesting to show people the city that they know, but literally from a perspective that they never really considered.""

Tom Blachford

For the exhibition space, Blachford has also created sculptures derived from the photos.

""I taught myself CAD (computer-aided design) and bought a 3D printer. I've built what are essentially 3D printed buildings inside an infinity box, which is suspended from the ceiling. When you look up into it, it looks like these tiny buildings go on forever above you,"" he explained.

Tom Blachford

The ultimate goal of these images, Blachford said, is to show the camera's ability to confuse our senses.

""To me that's the most interesting thing about photography and shooting at night, that the camera becomes this bridge to another world that's just out of reach of our senses. It's too dark, it's too far away, it's too bright, and we just can't process it in that way,"" he said.

""But the camera lets me distill that into something that you can see and experience.""",Tom Blachford's upside-down urban landscapes will make you look twice,"""They really look like they're composites of lots of images, but they're just one single shot and all I've done is turn them 180 degrees,"" said photographer Tom Blachford in a phone interview.

604,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-q-and-a-thursday-march-12/index.html,"(CNN) CNN readers are asking smart questions about coronavirus every day. So each weekday, we'll select some of the top questions and get you the answers.

Here are some of the most popular recent questions:

Q. Does donated blood get screened for coronavirus?

At least 4.5 million Americans need donated blood every year , but this is the first time novel coronavirus has been a concern in the nation's blood supply.

""Individuals are not at risk of contracting COVID-19 through the blood donation process or via a blood transfusion since respiratory viruses are generally not known to be transmitted by donation or transfusion ,"" said the AABB , formerly the American Association of Blood Banks.

""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to report that there have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19 to date,"" the group said.

""In addition, no cases of transfusion-transmission were ever reported for the other two coronaviruses that emerged during the past two decades (SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and MERS-CoV, which causes Mideast Respiratory Syndrome).""

The AABB said routine screening measures are already in place to prevent anyone with clinical respiratory infections from donating blood.

But there is one big concern involving blood donations and coronavirus: the possibility that fewer people will come out to donate.

""If the outbreak of coronavirus continues to spread, additional challenges may arise, which could potentially reduce the number of eligible donors,"" the AABB said.

Q. How do I stay healthy when using Uber or Lyft?

Both rideshare companies said they're actively trying to protect customers and drivers from coronavirus.

Uber said it is trying to give drivers with disinfectants to help keep their cars clean, and the company ""may temporarily suspend the accounts of riders or drivers confirmed to have contracted or been exposed to COVID-19.""

Uber said it's working with public health organizations who might tell them to pause an account. If that happens, Uber would suspend that account and those of any connected riders.

Lyft announced a similar policy: ""If we are notified of a rider or driver testing positive for COVID-19, they will be temporarily suspended from using Lyft until they are medically cleared.""

Both Lyft and Uber also said they will protect drivers financially if they are asked to isolate themselves.

""Any driver or delivery person who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or is individually asked to self-isolate by a public health authority will receive financial assistance for up to 14 days while their account is on hold,"" Uber said.

""We've already helped drivers in some affected areas, and we're working to quickly implement this worldwide.""

Q. How can I tell whether I have coronavirus or the flu? What are the different symptoms?

Testing is the only way to know for sure. But there have been problems with coronavirus testing -- from faulty test kits to major shortages and delays in getting tested

The flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms, such as fever and cough, but shortness of breath is a common hallmark of coronavirus.

Of course, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms at all. And asymptomatic people can still spread coronavirus to others.

So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Q. Can hand dryers kill coronavirus?

No, bathroom hand dryers can't kill coronavirus, the World Health Organization says. Doctors say the best ways to protect yourself include:

-- Washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds . If you can't wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand santizer.

-- Avoiding large crowds.

-- Staying at least 3 feet away from anyone who might be infected, especially if they're coughing or sneezing.

(CNN) In 2016, Donald Trump did his best to tarnish his opponent Hillary Clinton with an email ""scandal"" that amounted to nothing. In his 2020 reelection campaign, Trump's team has worked to conjure a similar cloud of controversy over Joe Biden's son Hunter, all without producing evidence of wrongdoing.

But now that Biden is fighting to save his candidacy, the President may have to prepare for a complicated set of competitors -- including Michael Bloomberg, a deci-billionaire who is spending whatever it takes to win; Bernie Sanders, a ""Democratic socialist"" who won the New Hampshire primary and has the allegiance of many young voters; and Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, two fresher faces with growing support.

This week, Democratic candidates will appear in CNN town halls and face off in a debate in Las Vegas days before Saturday's Nevada caucus.

The previously ""unelectable"" Mike Bloomberg is being given a serious look by Democrats, wrote Joe Lockhart. The former New York mayor is ""charisma challenged,"" has taken controversial stances, and in many quarters is seen as a symbol of the unaccountable one percent, Lockhart noted.

Arick Wierson, but he should think twice before accepting. ""Holding his own on next week's national stage would be a boon to the campaign, but the chances of him coming off as dry, lacking empathy, and somewhat mechanical loom large... Bloomberg may soon qualify for his first debate, wrote his former aide, but he should think twice before accepting. ""Holding his own on next week's national stage would be a boon to the campaign, but the chances of him coming off as dry, lacking empathy, and somewhat mechanical loom large... Bloomberg is not exactly a warm and fuzzy guy . He has a good sense of humor, but it's dry and a bit racy, meaning it rarely comes out in a public forum. He can appear stiff -- possibly why President Trump has taken to Twitter to troll the former mayor, tweeting that he 'can't debate and has zero presence.' ""

Jill Filipovic to write, "" Bloomberg has been effusively apologizing for his ""stop and frisk"" program in New York City. Last week, a 2015 audio recording resurfaced, with the former mayor speaking about crime in minority neighborhoods, promptingto write, "" These statements should be disqualifying for Bloomberg on their face: We definitely don't need another president who uses racist scare tactics and outlandishly false claims to justify his bad policy goals.""

Tara Setmayer, but time is running out: ""Months of the Republicans' constant drumbeat of blatant falsehoods and character assassination against Biden and his son Hunter throughout the impeachment trial, without an aggressive strategy from Biden to get ahead of it, has apparently worked. Biden's inability to seize control of the narrative and effectively mount an offense may have mortally wounded his candidacy. Biden, the Democrats' onetime frontrunner, still has a shot, argued, but time is running out: ""Months of the Republicans' constant drumbeat of blatant falsehoods and character assassination against Biden and his son Hunter throughout the impeachment trial, without an aggressive strategy from Biden to get ahead of it, has apparently worked. Biden's inability to seize control of the narrative and effectively mount an offense may have mortally wounded his candidacy. If Biden loses South Carolina, it's over .""

Uncle Joe goes negative

Lockhart said it was ""off brand"" for Uncle Joe to attack a fellow Democrat that way. Even worse, he wrote, it was ""a week too late. The campaign had to have seen the momentum Buttigieg was building in Iowa. Waiting until a rival wins, or co-wins, the first campaign test In the days before the New Hampshire primary, Biden rolled out a slashingly negative ad about former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.said it was ""off brand"" for Uncle Joe to attack a fellow Democrat that way. Even worse, he wrote, it was ""a week too late. The campaign had to have seen the momentum Buttigieg was building in Iowa. Waiting until a rival wins, or co-wins, the first campaign test makes the negative attack seem desperate, rather than strategic .""

Errol Louis. Buttigieg now leads the field in total delegates and placed just behind Sanders in New Hampshire, while Biden came in fifth, behind Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. ""Any lingering sense of Biden's inevitability or electability died in the Granite State,"" wrote

David Gergen. "" Sanders was widely proclaimed the frontrunner after Tuesday's primary, but without scoring a dominating victory. The Vermont senator deserves congratulations for being the ""most popular socialist in American history,"" wrote. "" But he may have crested in the 2016 campaign. After all, he won New Hampshire by over 20 points then against Hillary Clinton; this time, he won New Hampshire by less than 2 percentage points. And across most of the Democratic Party, strategists are worried about his chances against President Donald Trump. To them, he is the Jeremy Corbyn (leader of Britain's Labour Party) of the American left.""

Alice Stewart ""is the candidate to keep an eye on... His moderate views and new generation of leadership is Mayor Pete, wrote""is the candidate to keep an eye on... His moderate views and new generation of leadership is a more viable pathway to a new majority for the Democratic Party .""

Buttigieg was the target of a ""homophobic rant"" from Rush Limbaugh, the radio host recently awarded the Medal of Freedom by Donald Trump, noted LZ Granderson.

Limbaugh talked of ""the discomfort some voters would experience watching Buttigieg kiss his husband on the debate stage, especially if he's standing next to, as he put it, 'Mr. Man, Donald Trump.' As offensive as Limbaugh's remarks about Buttigieg were (and as ironic as his holding up Trump as the epitome of manliness were, considering it was the gay dude who volunteered to fight for this country and the straight one who pleaded 'bone spurs'), the reality is homophobia is not theoretical...it is actively practiced.""

Southern strategy

After Nevada, the Democratic primary heads south, beginning with South Carolina Feb. 29. ""Come on down, y'all,"" wrote former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. ""Now that almost 2% of delegates have been awarded from two very white states, attention will quickly shift to my neck of the woods,"" he noted.

""There are states with major delegate hauls. And states where black and brown voters will play a huge role...ultimately, southern Democrats are pragmatists. They want someone who can beat Trump and restore sanity to the White House.

Oh, and the food. ""The southern food culture is strong, from Texas, Memphis and Carolina BBQ to the Deep South's soul food to the shrimp and grits of the Low Country. So be prepared to eat.""

Why prosecutors quit Roger Stone case

The notorious political trickster and Trump acolyte Roger Stone faces sentencing Thursday on charges of lying to Congress, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

It was not surprising last week when President Trump tweeted that the recommended prison sentence being sought by the Justice Department was ""horrible and very unfair."" But it was a stunning departure from Justice Department practice when the department's leadership overruled the four prosecutors who tried Stone and recommended a more lenient sentence.

Carrie Cordero, a former Justice official, wrote, ""Four federal prosecutors didn't withdraw from the case against Roger Stone Tuesday because they had a substantive disagreement with their management. Four prosecutors withdrew from the case , a former Justice official, wrote, ""Four federal prosecutors didn't withdraw from the case against Roger Stone Tuesday because they had a substantive disagreement with their management. Four prosecutors withdrew from the case because they refuse to watch justice undone.

Trump and Attorney General William Barr, Frida Ghitis wrote, ""were following along a well-trod path across history: the systematic crushing of the independence of the judiciary. We have seen this movie before. It doesn't end well."" She added, that it ""has been the course charted by malign populists across the political spectrum, on the left and on the right. We saw it in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and in Vladimir Putin's Russia -- and too many others.""

As lawyers around the country objected to the Justice Department's actions, Barr observed that Trump's tweets were making his job impossible. But the White House seemed to have known Barr's complaint was coming.

""Claims that the Justice Department's decision had nothing to do with Trump's wishes takes Americans for fools, "" Ghitis wrote.

Republican commentator Alice Stewart has a special vantage point on Roger Stone. As communications director for Ted Cruz' presidential campaign, she saw the damage wrought by false stories spread by Stone. ""The personal character assassinations are just a small fraction of Stone's life's work dedicated to political destruction,"" Stewart wrote.

""It's fully appropriate for Stone's character history to be considered in the upcoming sentencing. Understanding full well that a presidential pardon is likely on the horizon, I encourage Judge (Amy) Jackson to lean on the high end of the guidelines and let the chips fall where they may .""

Payback tour

The Justice Department's about-face came after Trump started rooting out those who testified during his impeachment hearings. Elie Honig argued that Trump's dismissal of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman amounted to criminal witness retaliation.

""Trump himself publicly admitted that his purpose was to retaliate , directly mentioning Vindman's testimony as a cause for the move; Vindman 'reported contents of my 'perfect' calls incorrectly,' said Trump. When asked if Vindman deserves disciplinary action, Trump said that the decision lies with the military. And Donald Trump Jr. outright gloated in a tweet, delighting in the vengeful nature of the removals of two decorated military veterans.""

Peter Bergen wrote, ""We have come to an extraordinary moment in the United States when some of the It was too much for former White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly, who defended Vindman's decision to protest what he considered an ""illegal order.""wrote, ""We have come to an extraordinary moment in the United States when some of the most senior retired military leaders in the country are publicly taking President Trump to task . Traditionally, such officers have not taken political positions, even in retirement.""

Lev Golinkin, a writer and refugee from the Soviet Union, argued Democrats should be wary of rhetoric that compares the Trump administration's actions to those of dictatorship.

The real George Washington

""You Never Forget Your First,"" is the clever title of a new biography of George Washington by Alexis Coe. In honor of President's Day, Jane Greenway Carr interviewed the author and noted, Coe ""is the first woman to write a book about America's first president in nearly half a century.""

Carr wrote, ""If you're a lover or student of American history, you'll learn immediate bite-sized lessons from the book's first pages, replete with a ledger of 'Lies We Believe About the Man Who Could Not Tell Them' and lists of Washington's favorite things, animals, frenemies and pettiest acts. Here's why that's brilliant: You already know he won the American Revolution, and if you've listened to or seen 'Hamilton,' you know he did it with no navy and an army that was outgunned and outmanned.

""But did you know that Washington was a honey-obsessed surrogate father of four who named one of his dogs Cornwallis and ended up estranged from nearly every other revolutionary boldfaced name? After reading Coe's book, you feel like you know him -- his family, his desires, how he failed and grew and became the man who is on our money and inextricable from our national identity,"" Carr observed.

As immersed as Coe became in the life of Washington, she told Carr she wants to keep a little distance. ""I know that a lot of biographers in the introduction to their books write about what they do on Washington's birthday or how they grew up with him or have a personal relationship with him,"" Coe noted. ""I didn't have that -- and I really plan to keep it that way. Also, I promised my husband no more Washington.""",These people could make Trump's life miserable,"In his 2020 reelection campaign, Trump's team has worked to conjure a similar cloud of controversy over Joe Biden's son Hunter, all without producing evidence of wrongdoing.

1240,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-51806011,"Studies suggest that most people who transition to another gender do not have second thoughts. But after two trans men met and fell in love, their personal gender journeys took an unexpected turn, to a destination neither had foreseen.

""I always felt we have a very special history. We have special bodies, and a special connection based on the physical experience we had.""

Ellie is 21 and Belgian. Her German partner, Nele, is 24. Both took testosterone to become more masculine, and they had their breasts removed in double mastectomy surgery. Now they have detransitioned, and live again as female - the gender they were assigned at birth.

""I'm very happy I didn't have a hysterectomy,"" reflects Nele. ""It means I can stop taking hormones, and my body will return to looking feminine.""

Last year, they both made the decision to end their use of testosterone and start using the female pronouns ""she"" and ""her"" again. Slowly their own natural oestrogen has begun to re-feminise their bodies.

""I'm very excited to see the changes,"" says Ellie.

Their faces have softened, their bodies become curvier. But years of taking testosterone has had one profound, irreversible effect.

""My voice will never come back,"" says Nele. ""I used to love singing and I can't sing any more - like my voice is just very monotone, it works very differently. When I call someone on the phone, I get gendered as male.""

The stories of these two young people are complex.

They may not be typical of people who have transitioned to another gender. And they are not a judgement on the decisions of other trans people, be they trans men, trans women or non-binary.

Ellie does not remember being uncomfortable as a girl when she was a child. But that changed as she became adolescent.

""I realised I was doing a lot of boy things, and some people weren't fine with that - especially other kids. I remember being called things like 'hermaphrodite'.""

Tall and athletic, Ellie's love of basketball was identified as, ""a boy thing"" too. At 14, she realised she was attracted to other girls, and later came out to her parents.

""I was dating girls and happy about it,"" she says.

Then Ellie told her sister she was a lesbian.

""My sister told me she was proud of the woman I was becoming. And somehow that rang a bell for me. And I remember thinking, 'Oh, so I'm a woman now? I don't feel comfortable with that.' It wasn't that I wanted to be a boy - I just didn't want to be a woman. I wanted to be neutral and do whatever I wanted.""

At 15, Ellie believed becoming a woman might limit her choices in life. For Nele too, growing up female was not fun.

""It started with puberty, when I was around nine years old - with getting breasts before I even realised what it means to have them. My mother forbade me from going outside bare-chested. We had a lot of fights because I was like, 'Why can my brother go out bare-chested?' Obviously, my mother wanted to protect me, but I couldn't understand at the time.""

As Nele matured, there were also lecherous men to contend with.

Image copyright Nele Image caption Nele as a teenager, a trans man, and today

""I experienced a lot of catcalling. There was a street next to mine, and I couldn't go down there without a man hitting on me. I'm slowly realising now that I internalised all of that - that I was perceived in society as something sexy, something men desire, but not a personality.""

With her body developing fast, Nele saw herself as too large. She would later develop an eating disorder.

""Too fat, too wide - the thoughts about needing to lose weight started very early.""

Nele was attracted to women, but the thought of coming out as a lesbian was terrifying.

""I really had this image that I would be this disgusting woman, and that my friends wouldn't want to see me anymore because they'd think I might hit on them.""

At 19, Nele came out as bisexual - that seemed safer. But the experience of unwanted male attention and the discomfort she felt with her female body stayed with her. Nele fantasised about removing her breasts. Then she learned trans men get mastectomies.

""And I was like, 'Yeah, but I'm not trans.' And then I was like, 'Maybe I could fake being trans?' And then I was doing a lot of research and I realised a lot of those things trans men say are very similar to what I experienced - like 'I always felt uncomfortable with my body, and as a kid I wanted to be a boy.'""

The distress trans people feel because there is a mismatch between their gender identity and their biological sex is called gender dysphoria. Nele thinks her own dysphoria began around this time.

""I thought, actually, 'I don't have to fake being trans. I am transgender.'""

Nele could see only two options - transition or suicide. She sought help from a transgender support organisation. They sent her to a therapist.

""When I arrived, I was like, 'Yeah, I think I might be trans.' And he directly used male pronouns for me. He said it was so clear I'm transgender - that he's never been as sure with anyone else.""

Within three months, Nele was prescribed testosterone.

Ellie too became determined to access male hormones - in her case when she was just 16.

""I watched some YouTube videos of trans guys who take testosterone, and they go from this shy lesbian to a handsome guy who is super-popular. I liked thinking of myself having that possibility - it felt like I should have a male body.""

But being so young, she needed parental approval for any medical intervention. The first doctor she visited with her parents said Ellie should wait - she thought that was transphobic and found another medic who was positive about her desire to transition.

""He told my parents that all the effects were reversible - which is the biggest lie. I had done my research, and I knew that this doctor could not be trusted. But I was just so happy that he said that, because then my parents were OK with it.""

Ellie's dad, Eric, was worried about the impact testosterone would have on his child's health, but the doctor reassured him.

""We were still in shock from having a girl who wanted to be a boy,"" he remembers. ""And the doctor said hormones would be better for her.""

Eric and Ellie's mum felt all at sea in this new world of changing genders.

""I would've liked to have met someone to give me the words and find arguments to make her wait and think about it longer, but there was no-one,"" he reflects.

At first, testosterone made Ellie feel emotionally numb. Then she felt much better. At 17, she had a double mastectomy. Later, she graduated from high school, and left Belgium to go to university in Germany.

Transitioning to male had not ended Nele's feelings of despair. She was still suicidal, and her eating disorder was manifesting itself in extreme calorie-counting, and an obsession with her diet. Nele began to think testosterone was the only good thing in her life - and she still wanted a mastectomy. But she did not feel she could be totally honest with her gender therapist.

""I was very ashamed of my eating disorder. I mentioned it in the beginning, but I didn't dare talk about it more because of the shame - I think that's normal with eating disorders.""

Nele was worried her transgender treatment might be halted if there was any doubt about her mental health.

""It's a very tricky situation in Germany, because the therapist is the one who gives you the prescriptions for hormones and for surgery.""

There are few studies exploring the link between eating disorders and gender dysphoria. One review of the UK's Gender Identity Development Service in 2012 showed that 16% of all adolescent referrals in that year had some kind of ""eating difficulty"". But bear in mind that most referrals are young people assigned female at birth - natal girls, as they are called, who are more vulnerable to eating disorders than their natal male counterparts.

Brian and Daniel have been on a similar journey to Ellie and Nele but from a different starting point. Both were assigned male at birth, transitioned to female, and later detransitioned to become male again.

Some clinicians have suggested that eating disorders develop as a response to gender dysphoria, says Anastassis Spiliadis, a UK-based psychotherapist who treats patients with eating disorders and gender identity issues.

The theory is that if you treat the gender distress, the eating disorder will diminish. This can happen, but it is not what Spiliadis has seen among many of his clients - natal females in their 20s who, like Nele, are detransitioning.

""They thought transitioning to a different gender would alleviate the eating disorder and the dysphoria, but things have been much more complex. They regret the decision to take testosterone and have surgery. But what's really worrying is that some of them still have an eating disorder.""

He believes someone who is suffering from anorexia or bulimia may not be equipped to make irreversible health decisions.

""We know that eating disorders affect people at a bio-psychosocial level. Those who are medically and physically, but also cognitively compromised might have a distorted view of themselves or their bodies.""

Spiliadis believes good practice in this field should mean screening young people with gender identity issues for eating disorders. And because they are life-threatening, eating disorders should be treated before responding medically or surgically to the distress caused by gender dysphoria.

As a new student and trans man in Germany, Ellie thought her own dysphoria was a thing of the past, and she was getting on with life.

""I was passing as a man - I was passing so well. I got so many comments from people telling me my transition was such a success, because they couldn't tell I was trans.""

But an ambivalence about her male identity crept in.

""I started to feel like I had to hide so many aspects of my life, and not talk about my childhood as a girl. I didn't feel comfortable being seen as a cis man, and I started to feel like I didn't fit in anywhere.""

Transgender or trans - a person whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth

Cisgender or cis - a person whose gender identity does not differ from their assigned sex at birth

Non-binary - a person who doesn't identify as only male or only female

Pansexual - a person attracted to others regardless of their sex or gender identity

Beyond 'he' and 'she': The rise of non-binary pronouns

Dating was problematic.

""I wasn't comfortable dating women because I didn't want to be taken for a straight guy. And this discomfort I had with my own body partsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Well, I started to see female bodies as less good-looking, less valuable in a way.""

Ellie began to be attracted to men and identified as pansexual.

""I think that came about because of internalised misogyny. But I never really felt any connection with any cis men. Then I thought, maybe dating another trans man would make me feel close to someone and attracted at the same time.""

Did it work?

""It totally worked!""

So Ellie went on a dating app and met Nele - who was not especially looking for romance with another trans man.

""But it was definitely a plus when I started texting with Ellie. We share a lot of experiences, and I feel very comfortable around her.""

Image copyright Nele

After a first date in DÃÂ¼sseldorf, their relationship moved swiftly. Nele got the go-ahead for a long-desired mastectomy, and Ellie was a great support. The couple moved into a flat together.

And it was around this time that Ellie, a gender studies student, became interested in the culture war between trans activists and radical feminists that often erupts in the social media ether.

She started to question whether she was really transgender. ""Or is this just a way I found to go through life?"" she wondered.

Ellie and Nele had intense discussions about their own identities.

And there was something else - both were diagnosed with vaginal atrophy, a soreness and dryness commonly found in menopausal women, but also a side-effect of taking testosterone. The remedy was oestrogen cream.

""But it didn't really help,"" says Nele. ""And I thought, 'I'm putting my body full of hormones, when my body can make those on its own.'""

Ellie felt the same way.

""Isn't it worth trying to go natural for a bit, and just see how it goes?"" she thought.

That is when they stopped taking testosterone. But the decision to detransition was daunting.

""I was afraid of ending the hormones and going back to my body. I didn't even know my natural body because I transitioned so early,"" says Ellie.

""The thought of going back was scary, because I transitioned to escape my problems. Detransitioning means facing the things I never managed to overcome,"" says Nele.

There is little academic research about detransition. The studies that have been done suggest the rate of detransition is very low - one put the proportion of trans people who return to the gender they were assigned at birth at less than 0.5%. But so far, researchers have not taken a large cohort of transitioning people and followed them over a number of years.

""The longitudinal studies just haven't been done,"" says Dr Catherine Butler, a clinical psychologist at the University of Bath.

""But on social media - for example on Reddit - there's a detransitioning group that has over 9,000 readers. There will be academics like myself who are part of that, but even so, it is a huge number of people.""

The lack of academic research in this area has an impact for those re-thinking their gender journeys.

""It means there aren't guidelines or policy that informs how statutory services can support detransitioners. So they've had to self-organise, to establish their own networks,"" she says.

And that is what Nele and Ellie did. Using Nele's skills as a professional illustrator, they created post-trans.com - an online space where people like them can get in touch and share their experiences.

Image copyright Nele Image caption Illustration by Nele, on the post-trans.com website she set up with Ellie

Both of these young people are conscious of how stories of detransition have been used by transphobic organisations and commentators to invalidate the experience of trans and non-binary people, and attack their hard-fought access to health care. Neither Ellie nor Nele deny the rights of trans people. They do, however, question whether transition is always the right solution.

Now, just months into their detransition, they are adjusting to life as female and lesbian. And so are their friends and family.

""It was hard for her to call us and tell us,"" says Eric, Ellie's father, who is still getting used to using female pronouns for his once-again daughter.

""It's not black or white for me. I knew from the start when she first transitioned she would never be a man - she never had the idea of having the complete operation. So now it's a new in-between somewhere, but it's always her.""

So does his daughter regret her choices - her mastectomy, for example?

""All those physical changes I experienced during my transition helped me develop a closer relationship with my body - they're just part of my journey,"" says Ellie.

Nele is similarly sanguine.

""Bodies change through ageing and accidents - I don't feel sad my breasts are gone.""

Neither plans to have reconstructive surgery. More difficult sometimes is the experience of once again being gendered as female - especially by men on lonely station platforms at night, who might be a threat.

""Because if he perceives me as a man, I wouldn't feel thatÃ¢ÂÂ¦ But if I'm seen as a woman, maybe I'm in danger and have to watch out,"" says Nele.

But her experience - from ""she"" to ""he"" and back to ""she"" again - has also had a positive impact, especially on Nele's career.

""I always perceived myself as, 'Well, I'm just a girl who draws - I couldn't be a professional, self-employed illustrator.' And then I transitioned to become a man, and suddenly I was like, 'Oh, I can do those things.' It's something I hear a lot, that trans men feel more confident. I had the same experience. So I will take that and keep it.""

Ellie and Nele boarded a gender rollercoaster when they were still teenagers. It has not been an easy ride.

Now they are moving on, looking forward to life - perhaps with the addition of some pet cats.

Ellie and Nele approve of the use of female pronouns to refer to them throughout their lives, including when they were living as trans men.

911,https://us.cnn.com/2017/12/21/opinions/best-of-2017-opinions/index.html,"(CNN) In a year dominated by the beginning of the Trump presidency, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the man occupying the highest office in the land. But Donald Trump's many actions and tweets weren't the only subjects of interest. Stories of racism and white supremacist groups, workplace sexual harassment, freedom of the press and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too.

David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact

January 31

I woke up this morning as an alternative fact.

In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the President's chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings ""all the time.""

That is simply not true.

As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the United States would pursue in the war with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the President's decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it.

Dean Obeidallah: Donald Trump's most bone-chilling tweet

February 6

Dean Obeidallah

Here is Trump's truly jaw-dropping tweet from Saturday morning: ""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!""

Why is this so concerning? It's OK to argue about whether the judge should or shouldn't have issued this order. But Trump is apparently attempting to delegitimize our federal judiciary by calling Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush-appointed judge, a ""so-called"" judge while arguing that his decision is ""ridiculous.""

Let's be blunt, because the stakes demand it: An independent federal judiciary is our last, best hope at preventing Trump from violating the US Constitution and illegally grabbing power. And Trump has to understand that, hence his attempt to undermine it.

George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past

February 19

George Takei

I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.

I remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.

That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion.

Peter Bergen: Why the 'mother of all bombs' and why now?

April 13

Peter Bergen

The dropping of a ""mother of all bombs"" Thursday by the United States on an ISIS cave and bunker complex in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan should be understood as part of an effort to reverse a war that is not going well for the Afghan government and, by extension, the United States.

The non-nuclear 21,600-pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) ""targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.

Thursday's bombing had a feeling of deja vu. A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15,000 pound ""Daisy Cutter"" bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001. Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region.

Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights

April 19

Nikki Haley

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the US ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

My heart dropped. She didn't know me at all.

John McWhorter: A man who is tragically unfit to be president

May 2

John McWhorter

When President Donald Trump revealed that he doesn't know why the Civil War was fought, or at least figures it could have been averted by the kind of deal-making he supposedly excels at, it was revealing in ways beyond the ones easy to glean.

The ignorance is, as usual, stunning for someone in the public spotlight. ""People don't ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?"" Trump asks rhetorically, which is like saying no one has bothered to study anatomy or physics.

Yet this sort of thing should no longer surprise us from this man. He doesn't read and lacks curiosity, but that's hardly rare among human beings. A college teacher friend of mine the other day noted that no one in his class could name who was president in the 1980s, nor, upon being told who it was, could they name his political party. People like this don't mysteriously develop an interest in civics after college. Sometimes they become president.

Michael D'Antonio: The little boy president

May 16

Michael D'Antonio

Like most little boys, Donald Trump can be disarmingly honest, as when he once said, ""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same. The temperament is not that different."" The trouble is that the first grader is now President of the United States, and his temperament is on display for the world to see.

Unpredictable, impulsive and immature, Trump acts in a way that would be expected of a 6-year-old boy, but is terrifying in a man whose moods dictate decisions carried out by adults on behalf of the most powerful nation in the world.

Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey offers a sterling example of the childish -- and reckless -- Trump style. When Comey broke with bureau tradition and spoke negatively about Trump's rival in the election, though initially he was criticized by candidate Trump, he was later praised -- and effusively. Over and over again, the soon-to-be-president described how Comey had done the right thing in criticizing Hillary Clinton. Comey remained in Trump's good graces after he was inaugurated, and Trump's team expressed confidence in him up until last week.

Anushay Hossain: The ugly truth behind Saudi Arabia's love for Melania Trump

May 23

Anushay Hossain

Donald Trump's first major trip overseas may be fraught with diplomatic land mines for the President, but the Trump administration can at least comfort itself with the clear hit that Melania Trump has been with the Saudi press.

The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia -- mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her ""classy and conservative"" fashion choices -- works well in the notoriously anti-woman kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually. Melania walks behind her husband, is quiet and reserved, does not make obvious demands (at least not ones we can hear), and most importantly, she looks beautiful and polished...

In Melania, the Saudi press and the Saudi government found the perfect spokeswoman, who projects a glamorous image that glosses over one of world's most autocratic and oppressive regimes.

Gloria Borger: Trump, home all alone

May 30

So Trump returns to the White House this week just as he left -- lonely, angry and not happy with much of anyone. The presidency, Donald Trump is discovering, is not an easy or natural fit.

""He now lives within himself, which is a dangerous place for Donald Trump to be,"" says someone who speaks with the President. ""I see him emotionally withdrawing. He's gained weight. He doesn't have anybody whom he trusts.""

The question, he adds, is whether Trump will understand the enormity of what he faces or will instead ""be back to being arrogant and stubborn."" He will have to realize that ""all this trip really did was hit the pause button.""

Douglas Heye: After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go

June 14

Douglas Heye

Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an art form. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy.

On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind ""us versus them"" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks.

Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues.

We know what we will do today. We will pray and we will come together. But what we do tomorrow is even more important.

John Kirby: Here's what we're sure of in the USS Fitzgerald collision

June 17

John Kirby

First, we know the crew fought heroically to save their ship and the lives of their shipmates. We know that from early reports by Navy officials but also from the images that flashed across our screens, our tablets and our phones after the incident happened early Saturday.

One look at the crushed, twisted starboard side, the hoses flaked about, the water being discharged, the frantic work being done tells you all you need to know about the stuff you can't see in those same images: a fiercely brave crew working together to staunch the flooding, to rescue their shipmates and to save their ship.

You can be certain they ended up drenched, exhausted, scraped and bruised -- but not broken. They kept that ship from foundering for 16 brutal hours. And they brought her back into port.

Jen Psaki: Putin set a trap and Trump fell into it

July 7

Jen Psaki

The Russians just played the President. It was predictable. And he let it happen.

On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting.

To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of its annexation of Crimea.

And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world.

President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia.

We should have had some leverage. So what happened?

Jane Carr: What the white supremacist view of history leaves out

August 18

Jane Greenway Carr

The white supremacists in Charlottesville said they wanted to ""defend history"" by protesting efforts to take down Confederate monuments. They say they feel threatened. They fear the removal of ""white stories"" from our culture.

I used to teach African-American literature and cultural history. I wish I could tell them what real erasure looks like. I'd ask them to think about the memorials that never existed in public spaces in the South -- noting Richmond's past as a slave market, or the communities of free blacks who were terrorized by the installation of these Confederate monuments in the first place. To take down Charlottesville's statue of Robert E. Lee will not change the fact that all Virginia schoolchildren know his name, while the names of those who lived in the lost Charlottesville neighborhood of Vinegar Hill are forgotten.

I keep returning to the question: How can people who claim to love history get the meaning of history so very, very wrong?

Lev Golinkin: Jared and Ivanka are failing a basic moral test

August 19

Lev Golinkin

But the silence emanating from Jared and Ivanka was exponentially more powerful than any I'd heard before. To me, as a Jew, seeing nothing but two tweets from Ivanka brought the kind of pain I'm sure is echoed by African-Americans anytime Ben Carson defends the President, and Asian-Americans in the wake of Elaine Chao's and Nikki Haley's equivocations: condemning hate in general terms while carefully avoiding criticizing the very administration they're part of.

No press conference was forthcoming, no rejection of Donald Trump's words; there was no statement from Jared about the horror his grandparents had survived; nothing from Ivanka, who had spoken about standing up for mothers on the campaign trail, about defending today's Jewish children -- her children; indeed all children -- from intimidation and violence. There was nothing, but the sound of steady clicking on Ivanka's electronic device as she wrote two tweets.

It was like listening to the fabric of Judaism tear at itself.

Peniel Joseph

Fifty-four years later, King's legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo in large swaths of the American public. King's words remain a singular anchor for all those who believe in freedom; by speaking truth to power in a political climate more racially toxic than our own, King did more than dream about racial justice.

He challenged all of us to embrace a vision of a liberated future capable of touching individual hearts and minds as it traversed through the blood and veins of the body politic, on the way to creating a nation as good as the best of its citizens.

Alice Stewart: What Trump got right in Texas

August 30

Alice Stewart

Hurricane Harvey is historic, not just in its size and scope, but in its significance as Donald Trump's first natural disaster test as President. His ""darned if you do, darned if you don't"" decision to visit South Texas on Tuesday, away from the rescue efforts, was the right call. Trump is demonstrating he has the compassion and commitment to meet the needs of victims of the deadly storm.

Critics blasted Trump for not meeting with victims directly to offer his personal condolences. Look, there's plenty of time for the powerful photos showing comfort, but now is the time for action -- not optics. These people are in the rescue and recovery mode, which can only be hampered by the distraction of a presidential visit. They need homes, not hugs; they need structure, not selfies, and they need funds, not a presidential flyover.

Unfortunately, every president has been forced to lead this country through natural or man-made disasters and faced the challenges of serving as consoler in chief: President Barack Obama had the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings; President George W. Bush had 9/11; President Bill Clinton met the challenge after the Oklahoma City bombing. All rose to the occasion.

Likewise, Trump is stepping up to the challenge, reassuring storm victims that resources are on the way.

LaQuishe Wright: Harvey survivor: The loss is hitting me in waves

September 1

LaQuishe Wright

I woke up Friday morning and looked outside at a deceptively beautiful day. Beautiful because my two sons, Bry and Ryan, two dogs and I are safe and dry and the sun is shining again after days of endless rain. Deceptive because our entire life as we know it is submerged in 4 feet of water less than 20 minutes away.

To experience devastation like that brought by Hurricane Harvey feels very different from what you've probably seen on television. I was lucky enough to make it out of my house in Katy with my kids, my dogs, our cars and at least some of our belongings and memories. My neighbors' harrowing evacuations make me feel even luckier to have made it out safely, but I can't help but be concerned about what comes next for us.

Brooke Baldwin: Speaking like this to women in 2017? No way

September 18

Brooke Baldwin

The newsroom around me fell silent. I was staring into the camera trying to make sense of what was unfolding on live television. I even caught my cameraman Jay's eyes in disbelief. I thought again: ""It is 2017, and this grown man is on my show talking with me -- a female host -- about boobs. Is this seriously happening?""

And then I did something I've done only a handful of times in my career. I told the control room to kill his mic and said ""bye."" I invite a variety of people on my show with wide-ranging opinions -- sometimes even my jaw hits the floor, too -- but I let them speak. Whether it's left, right or center -- I want to expose my viewers to other perspectives. Agree with them or not, the nation needs to listen.

Eleanor McManus, Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin

October 26

Eleanor McManus

Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me -- perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion.

I don't quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me...

I'm telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I'm hoping women today will finally speak out in real time -- when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women.

Marvin Washington: Kneeling isn't about patriotism -- it's a distress signal

October 14

Marvin Washington

I spent 10 years playing in the NFL, won a Super Bowl and have been blessed beyond imagination -- in no small part because of the best fans in professional sports -- fans of multiple races, genders, religions and political persuasions.

I'm not confused about the role the fans played in my success and neither are the current players in the league. I understand that many NFL fans on both sides feel strongly about the National Anthem protests and the issues of race that underlie them -- so do I and so do the current players. I am an African-American who grew up in the 1960s and the vitriol that surged two Fridays ago, stoked by a speech delivered in Alabama no less, is eerily reminiscent for me of that dark time in our history.

Some players had been engaging in periodic protest long before President Donald Trump's fateful rally, but it's also fair to say this wasn't top of mind for most people before that rally. Trump suggested (mostly white) owners should fire any of the (mostly black) players on their teams who engaged in protest during the National Anthem, and he called them a profane name.

The protests, begun by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and now being carried on by current players, are not about patriotism -- they are about systemic racial inequality in the criminal justice system. They are about how communities of color are policed -- problems that experts on both sides agree on.

Nicole Stamp: What decent men can do in response to #MeToo

October 21

Nicole Stamp

8. Don't use gendered or misogynist insults. Words like bitch, cunt, or slut only target women. Sissy, fairy and cuck demean feminine traits as lesser, weak and undesirable in men. Avoid those words. If you must insult someone, focus on their actions, not their body or their gender.

9. Free kids from rigid gender roles. For boys and young men, you can role-model that activities and traits traditionally coded as ""feminine"" are valuable. Challenge dismissive ideas around what counts as ""girl stuff."" Delight in stories with strong female characters. Give a toddler boy a baby doll and praise his gentleness. Race trucks with a little girl. Give kids the tools and confidence to challenge and defy gender stereotypes.

10. Don't focus on little girls' looks. Many people's first interaction with a young girl is to compliment her cuteness, prettiness or clothing. But this tells her -- and any boys nearby -- that beauty is her most interesting trait. Instead, ask little girls engaging, gender-neutral questions, like ""What kind of toy is that? What subjects do you like in school? What's your favorite animal? Hey, what are you reading?"" There are so many things to talk about.

Brianna Keilar: With my husband deployed, covering the news hits home

October 25

Brianna Keilar

The last few days the news has been dominated by a controversy over Trump's call to Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow. She is just 24 years old and pregnant with her third child, mourning her husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in an ISIS ambush in Niger. ...

Moments of dignity and solemnity have been interrupted over and over by politics and vitriol and today, it seems, is no different.

I turn the television off and retweet the President's tweet, commenting, ""As I'm watching 'Taking Chance' this tweet alerts on my phone. And that about sums up this week for me.""

A few minutes later a man tweets at me: ""It's telling that you are only now watching this. Been out for years. More evidence U and other media R in a bubble & don't know real people.""

I just can't let it go.

""My husband is on his sixth deployment right now. You don't know anything about me,"" I reply.

Mr. Trump, please stop it. Please stop!

Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way.

Listen to what Myeshia Johnson said this morning in an interview on ABC.

""The President said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways and I was -- it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband's name. The only way he remembered my husband's name because he told me he had my husband's report in front of him and that's when he actually said La David.""

I know you have children -- and two daughters.

Mel Robbins: Why Americans don't give a damn about mass shootings

November 6

Mel Robbins

One month ago, the worst mass shooting in US history took place at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 people injured. Bill O'Reilly boiled the massacre down to six words: ""This is the price of freedom.""

I hate to say it, but he is right. Sunday, just 34 days after Vegas, 26 people were gunned down and about 20 others were wounded during a church service in Texas. And here's what is really sick -- we won't be surprised when there's another mass shooting next month. Maybe it'll be your church, your mall, your concert or your movie theater. That's the price of freedom.

In America, we are free to stockpile weapons. We are free to order ammo online. We are free to outfit our guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did. This is the price we pay for freedom, alright. The freedom to not give a damn.

It has taken me a few days to process the sudden explosion of allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault made against Harvey Weinstein. Each woman who steps forward leaves me with a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and pride when I see women joining together to share their stories. On the other, I experience a sense of horror over the staggering number of accusers. Women stripped of their power, silenced and shamed.

I was one of them and recounted my own experience publicly last week.

In my own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, I have been made to feel as if I had to compromise my own convictions for the advancement of my career. I was made to believe that my talent and experience should take a back seat to my physical appearance. I was manipulated into believing I had ""asked for it."" And I was made to feel that if I spoke out or fought back, the repercussions would make me regret it.

Ann Moses: I watched fame take its toll on young David Cassidy

November 22

Ann Moses

When he got the ""Partridge"" gig, David was barely 20, and had very little life experience. He also had little or no support system when he became an overnight sensation. I watched it all happen, and later saw it all unravel, as I spent several days a week on the Partridge set, covering David and his co-stars, real-life stepmom Shirley Jones and Susan Dey.

At first, David was giddy to be appearing on a prime-time television series. He was cheerful and cooperative, which made my job easier as I worked every angle to come up with stories about this shiny-haired young man. ...

A few months later, the nice young man who'd kissed my mom on the cheek in thanks for looking after his puppies was pretty much gone. Whenever I appeared on set, David began to disappear between scenes -- during the times he had once joined me for interviews. I couldn't write about David's favorite snack food (dry-roasted peanuts) or his favorite color (""It depends on my mood"") or how he felt about his neat new sports car if he was hiding from me all the time.

David Gergen: Trump's foolish war with the press

November 27

David Gergen

In other words, we are witness to a war between Trump and the press, playing out every day in newspapers and television. Each morning brings a new revelation; each evening touches off a shouting match. It is difficult to remember any press secretary since Nixon's Ron Ziegler who has faced so much suspicion from the Fourth Estate.

Yet what is equally surprising is how oblivious this White House is to what has gone wrong and how to fix it. His team is as disdainful of history as it is of time-honored traditions about press-government relations. Either they suffer from massive incompetence or extraordinary arrogance.

History has been quite clear: The presidents who have built the best relationships with the press are those who respect its place in American life, have enjoyed a give and take with reporters and care about the truth. From Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Jack Kennedy to Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, press coverage has been much more favorable because those leaders in the Oval Office were not only good copy but men of character in their public lives.

Mark Bauerlein: Why Trump is still winning

December 5

Mark Bauerlein

This is the real battle going on in D.C. today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. ...

And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump's way.

This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don't mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality and victimhood.

Arianne Zucker, I have no fear, so 'Access Hollywood' tape will never define me

December 6

Arianne Zucker

Now that the ""Access Hollywood"" tape is back in the news after reports that Donald Trump questions its authenticity, I am puzzled for this reason: Just from experience, anyone who has ever been on television before, with a microphone pinned to them, should always assume that someone is listening. And when you get caught speaking poorly about someone, at least own up to it.

People ask me whether I need or want an individual apology from either now-President Trump or Billy Bush. Well, apologizing to me would be the appropriate thing to do. Am I losing sleep over it waiting for one? Absolutely not.

I refuse to let a situation such as this one take away my emotional power.

777,https://us.cnn.com/travel/article/coronavirus-quarantine-luxury-maldives-resort/index.html,"(CNN) Ã¢ÂÂ While there's no doubt that having your vacation interrupted by a fast-spreading virus that's infected more than 108,000 globally and killed over 3,800 is a major inconvenience, there are surely worse places to be confined than a luxury Maldives resort.

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

260,https://us.cnn.com/2017/02/22/opinions/nursing-home-rape-essay/index.html,"Bobbi Young holds a photo of her mother, Marilyn Young, the day after she passed away at home in Carmel Valley, California.

(CNN) I scanned my mother's bed, pulled back the rumpled sheets and uncovered her shivering naked body. I stared at her bruised inner thighs, her sheets wet with urine and blood, her catheter pulled completely out of her. I covered her with a blanket and held her close as she pleaded, ""Get me out of here.""

I kissed her forehead, our tears mixing, and promised no one was going to stop me. She would not spend another night in this nursing home.

I pushed the call button. No response. I followed the cord to the wall and found it disconnected. My heart racing, I tracked down an aide and demanded that a nurse come to my mother's room immediately. At 88, she was examined with nonchalance and covered back up.

I called the manager to her room and told her I was taking Mom home.

The nursing staff gathered in force, attempting to convince me that her release was a long process, that my mother could still benefit from their help. Her stay in the nursing home had been a temporary transition needed after being hospitalized with a stroke.

But I knew my mother had been harmed. I feared the worse. And I feared for her life if she stayed there.

I called her doctor to sign a release form, and I phoned a service for private medical transport. I also called my husband and said, ""I need to bring Mom home with us today. Go get Daddy.""

At the front door of the nursing home, the management staff lined up to wish us well. They invited us to come back and visit.

""Thank you,"" I told them, ""but we will never drive by this road again.""

When we arrived home, the driver unloaded my bundled mother and the rain momentarily stopped. I looked up and saw my father, his hand pressed to the window, tears in his eyes and mouthing the words ""Mama ... Mama's home."" Married 69 years, my parents experienced every second apart as an eternity.

Once settled in their own bed, Daddy curled up next to Mother, held her hand, prayed with her, assured her she was OK now, home safe. She was still recovering from her stroke, and even though my father sensed some harm had come to her, he didn't ask. He didn't want to stress her more. He never left her side.

Medical equipment, photos of happier times and leftover Christmas decorations fill Marilyn Young's bedroom.

Over the weeks that followed, my mother complained of pain in her groin area. Doctors increased the doses of pain medication, but she still awoke in anguish, day after day. I finally had to examine her -- and my heart sank.

I knew she needed to be seen by her gynecologist as soon as possible.

A nurse practitioner examined my mother and ran tests to confirm her suspicions: a sexually transmitted disease. Had my mother shown these symptoms before, she asked. The answer was no. Had my mother had any sexual partners besides my father in her lifetime? The answer was no.

When I told her about what had happened in the nursing home, the nurse said my father would need to be tested for the disease. My mother was visibly shaken. I asked the nurse, if my father was negative, what would be the next step? She said, you need to call the California Department of Public Health and file a report.

We drove home silently. My mind struggled with how much my mother had been through; now we were minutes away from devastating my father. I asked if she wanted my help in telling Daddy. The answer was yes.

As I spoke, Daddy didn't hesitate to agree to be tested. Then he asked what all of this meant. What would proving he was negative for the disease mean?

Mama, her voice choked with sadness, replied: ""I was raped.""

My father held my mother, crying, shaking his head in disbelief and apologizing for not being able to keep her safe.

I grew up believing my parents were strong and took comfort trusting I would always be safe. They both worked two or three jobs throughout my childhood to buy me and my siblings encyclopedias to enhance our knowledge of the world long before Google existed.

Witnessing this wound inflicted on my parents cut deeply to the core of my own foundation. The hospital had recommended the nursing home as a transitional step; her own internist was the director of the facility: What could possibly go wrong?

There were no warning flags. We failed to protect her against something we could not even imagine existed. A distress signal is only as good as the person who sees it. When I saw it, I took action. But it was too late.

For months, my parents comforted each other, not wanting to be even a foot apart. Their love never wavered; it only deepened. I would walk past their bedroom and see them snuggled tightly together, whispering. My father later told me they were praying and planning to renew their wedding vows on their 70th anniversary.

Beyond the harm the perpetrator had inflicted on my mother, he took a toll on my father's remaining strength and stole some of the precious time my parents had left. Still, together they decided to fight for reform, which my husband and I fully supported. We filed a civil lawsuit against the facility, arguing that more should have been done to protect my mother. She was brave enough to appear at the center of a public service video created by a nonprofit calling for nursing home reform.

After taking her mother into her own home, Bobbi Young cared for her until Marilyn passed away in January.

Two months before my father passed away at 95, he told my mother his time was near and asked my husband and I to help them renew their vows early. They exchanged their promises tearfully and glowed with renewed divinity. He did not live long enough to see my mother receive a settlement in her case against the nursing home.

On the day my father died, my husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. His painful journey ended 17 months later. But our commitment to choose love and joy enabled Mother and I to embrace our faith and carry on. I promised my husband I would not be sad or bitter. I had promised my father I would care for Mama and keep her safe.

I feared that I would not be able to fulfill those promises.

But there are moments in life that transcend fear. They mend twisted hearts. This became one of those moments.

After my husband's funeral, all of my mother's nurturing traits intensified. I had promised to care for her, and now she was providing me with what felt like a second childhood. She took the reins, suggesting remedies such as extra locks on doors and an alarm system to quiet our fears. She reminded me of recipes to help stretch our dollars to survive -- such as making ""imagination cookies."" When I looked sad, she would talk about funny things my husband did to make her laugh. We prayed together, planned our spring garden, went for drives on hot days with the windows down, hair blowing in the wind, laughing with memories.

I promised my mother I would honor her vow to carry on her courageous battle for justice all the days of my life by telling her story. While her perpetrator will likely never be found, it was one of her last wishes for people to understand that no one is too old to become a victim of rape.

My mother died in January. She was 94. As I walk around my home now, I look at the empty rocking chair in which she soothed her children. I can feel her brushing my long hair. The seedlings she planted in eggshells on Christmas Day are bursting toward spring. I can hear her laughter and her reminder to me: ""The gifts God gave you, he did not give to another; respect them and share them wisely. ...""

Who was this woman in my life? Why was she made to suffer so?

An answer fills my sorrowful heart:

Suffering can carve two types of people, monsters and angels. I am fortunate to have been raised by angels. And I pray to one day be worthy of that divine fabric that still holds me tightly together -- love.

465,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/media/nba-coronavirus-espn-tnt/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The NBA's announcement it was suspending its season after a player preliminarily tested positive for coronavirus sent shockwaves throughout the world of sports and media.

The league decision Wednesday to suspend games until further notice is a major blow to its television partners, Disney's ABC and ESPN and AT&T's TNT. The NBA is not just one of the most popular sports leagues on the planet, it's also a major driver of advertising revenue for these networks.

Despite its sluggish numbers this season, the NBA still brings in viewers at a time when more and more people are watching streaming services likein lieu of traditional TV. This is whyand WarnerMedia's Turner renewed a TV rights deal in 2014 that reportedly cost $24 billion . (WarnerMedia is also the parent of CNN.)

""From a media business point of view, this suspension means everything,"" Lee Igel, a clinical associate professor at the NYU Tisch Institute for Global Sport, told CNN Business.

Igel added that this situation is unique because it impacts the network's ratings in two ways: primarily broadcasting the games and also broadcasting the NBA as a ""media product,"" or something that studio shows like ""Inside the NBA"" and ""SportsCenter"" can talk endlessly about.

""This is different than when games aren't being played in the offseason and people can bat around which free agents might go where,"" he said. ""There's a lot less to talk about.""

Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive, said it's ""a serious impairment for this quarter and likely the next.""

""There's many questions that have yet to be answered,"" Crakes told CNN Business. ""What happens to the advertising revenue that's already been booked? Do the networks have to give that money back or is there a way to make this work out over the long run? And most importantly will the NBA find a way to continue its season in some way?""

Crakes pointed out that the NBA Playoffs, which were set to start in April, are the crown jewel of the season for the league and its TV partners, and if they can still take place it could help make up for the losses from the suspended season.

""If the playoffs air, networks could use some of their advertising inventory they hold back to make good on the missing games from the season,"" Crakes said. ""It makes things better, it helps, but it probably won't make up for what happened.""

The losses of advertising revenue from the suspension could be ""in the range of $75 million to $100 million"" across the games on ABC, ESPN and Turner, Crakes said.

Turner Sports said in a statement Wednesday it has ""a long-standing relationship with the NBA and we're supportive of the actions being taken to help protect the health and well-being of everyone involved. We'll partner closely with league officials to evaluate and determine next steps at the appropriate time.""

As for ABC and ESPN, the networks called it an unprecedented situation.

""We have great relationships with our league partners and are confident we can address all issues constructively going forward,"" the networks said in a statement. ""Our immediate focus is on everyone's safety and well-being.""

But the timing of the suspension couldn't be worse for the league's TV partners.

""More people are going to be working from home and nesting at home from a safety standpoint, avoiding other people,"" Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed, told CNN Business. ""So people are going to be looking for forms of in home entertainment.""

have put their seasons on hold. The NBA isn't the only major sport pausing its season. The NHL and Major League Soccer have put their seasons on hold.

642,https://us.cnn.com/2020/02/28/africa/nigeria-confirms-first-case-of-coronavirus-intl/index.html,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) The head of Nigeria's National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says the country is more than capable of dealing with coronavirus as Africa's most populous nation records its first case.

""Nigeria is ready,"" Chikwe Ihekweazu said. ""We successfully managed Ebola and we manage outbreaks all the time and are currently managing Lassa fever. We have a strong team that is used to doing this.""

An Italian citizen who traveled to Lagos, Nigeria's economic nerve center, became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa, the country's Health Ministry reported earlier.

Ihekweazu told CNN the Italian patient who arrived in the country with the virus is currently stable and ""has mild to moderate symptoms.""

""We are very hopeful for his full recovery,"" said Ihekweazu, an epidemiologist who was appointed CEO of the NCDC in 2016 and has been credited with transforming the organization.

According to Ihekweazu, the man was screened on arrival at the airport, however, he presented no symptoms at the time, which is why the temperature scanners at the airport did not detect he was ill.

""Screening is not a fool proof method as the virus has an incubation period of four to five days,"" he added.

Earlier this week, Algeria confirmed the first case on the continent, another Italian passenger who entered the country on February 17. The patient was placed in quarantine, and under close supervision, according to health authorities in Algeria.

'Astute physicians'

Nigerian officials say the patient who works in Nigeria arrived in Lagos on February 25 and became ill the next day but quick thinking physicians who examined him contacted the NCDC after asking him about his travel history.

""He had astute physicians,"" Ihekweazu said. ""The doctor got in touch with us when he found out he had just come from Milan, we collected a sample, tested it and isolated him in a facility in Lagos that manages infectious diseases.""

Ihekweazu points to the speed with which Nigeria identified and confined the patient as a sign the country is prepared to deal with the outbreak.

""The system worked. We identified this case, diagnosed and isolated within 48 hours of it entering the country. In other countries like Iran and Italy for instance, by the time the first case had been confined, there was widespread contact.""

No water access

Frequent handwashing with soap and water is one of the key ways of ensuring infectious diseases such as coronavirus do not spread.

However, one in six healthcare facilities globally do not have both soap and water available for doctors, nurses and patients to wash their hands, says Tim Wainwright, Chief Executive, WaterAid UK.

Figures from WHO shows that only 42 percent of Nigerians have access to water, soap and washing facilities on their premises, while 25 percent have no access to water at all.

Nigeria has around 200 million citizens so there are significant concerns about the impact of coronavirus spreading widely.

The World Health Organization recently said that an outbreak of coronavirus in Africa would hit the continent harder than China.

The novel coronavirus has killed at least 2,800 people worldwide , the vast majority in mainland China.

There have been more than 83,000 global cases, with infections in every continent except Antarctica.

Many of the countries in Africa are already dealing with severe health crises with limited resources, such as Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

A race against time

Ihekweazu said the government is now racing against time to identify all the passengers on the plane and all the people who may have come in contact with the man who was working as a consultant in Ogun State, around 100 km outside of Lagos.

""The contact tracing is happening now and we are looking in detail at who he might have come in contact with. The easier part is identifying people on the flight as we have the manifest, but the difficult part is the people he may have come in contact with. We are asking them to

Despite Nigeria's preparedness, Ihekweazu said resources are stretched and the unknown nature of the coronavirus means that there are no guarantees.

""This is a new virus. As much as we can do our best, there are no guarantees of success. Resources will always be a challenge for us. In the short term, we have what we need to mount a moderate response but the more these cases happen, the more stretched we will become.""

The health ministry urged citizens not to panic and to avoid spreading misinformation.

Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) It's too bad Superman is not running for president of the United States; this would have been his year. Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned -- and yearning for a savior.

This happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn't seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.

No, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.

Who would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist -- throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!

Looking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking ""them"" -- whoever ""they"" happen to be at the moment -- vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini , the theatrical Italian ""Duce,"" the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.

Is Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn't propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He's a Trumpist. And we're only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.

Fascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump's rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?

Cult of personality

One distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner's main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That's not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There's very little in the way of substance. There's just a lot of Trump.

And to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution , and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations : armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)

Charisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.

Validating prejudices

Trump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between ""us"" and ""them.""

We don't know what kind of a president he would be. It's hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there's no telling. He has already defied all predictions.

In a new turn of events since Thursday's GOP debate, Trump's opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump's savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It's good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it's unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it's a sad sight.

Sanders found a scapegoat

Then there's the other end of the political spectrum: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the longtime Independent socialist politician now running as a Democrat.

Sanders is no 1930s Marxist. He is not advocating the takeover by the state of the means of production and the abolition of private property. But in the spirit of his socialist convictions, he too has found a scapegoat for all that ails America. Sanders would squeeze the rich, for whom he does not hide his contempt. In the manner of a demagogue, he declared , ""Fraud is the business model of Wall Street.""

Sanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system. But his overall approach, if it could ever be implemented, has the makings of an economic disaster . We know that because it was already tried.

Hillary Clinton's overwhelming victory in South Carolina may mark the beginning of the end for the Sanders movement, perhaps a sign that voters know Sanders' idealistic offerings, no matter how appealing, are disconnected from what is possible.

His plans would create deficits so large that there are not enough zeroes in calculator displays to hold them. His plans would produce deficits of between $18 trillion to $30 trillion (with a T) from new spending. You can squeeze the Wall Street billionaires as hard as you want. Even they don't have that much money. And while you're at it, see what happens to the economy if you impose the taxes required to even start those programs.

Sanders running honorable but mistaken campaign

Both Trump and Sanders are advocating granting much greater powers to the government. To be sure, Sanders appears to be aiming to force discussion of important issues in the campaign, and, unlike Trump, has run an honorable, throughtful and respectful campaign.

Trump would apparently expand government to secure the country from enemies and from immigrants. Sanders would do it to pay for social plans. Both positions carry a faint whiff of Nirvana, telling voters who feel unsettled -- by growing inequality, expensive unwon wars, and a sense that America is starting to fall behind -- that they have an answer to repair the country, to make them feel safe.

339,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-analysis-nick-paton-walsh-intl/index.html,"(CNN) When the mixed signals and blundering of President Donald Trump's Wednesday night Oval Office speech die down, it's possible that the two words ""foreign virus,"" are the ones that will endure.

They echo Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- at his least diplomatic -- who dubbed the outbreak that has now killed over 4,000 people in dozens of countries the ""Wuhan virus.""

There's no comfort in the irony that an administration which tried initially to dismiss COVID-19 as something happening elsewhere that wasn't a problem, are -- now it is upon them -- blaming people elsewhere for giving them the problem.

This insular populism seems to have fueled President Trump's European flight ban . It bizarrely excluded the UK and gladly ignored the possibility people might use Britain as a transfer hub from infected countries, on to the US.

It was a Stephen Miller response to an Anthony Fauci question. Trump was clear only in how decisive he wanted to appear. The technicalities were a sideshow, but if you are facing a pandemic, they should be the main dish.

The address was a bid to deflect blame by an administration confused about everything in its response, bar its own infallibility. When they came, the clarifications were perhaps longer than the original statement -- mentioning that trade was not included, neither were Americans themselves, or US residents, or their immediate family.

Yet the damage was done: confusion at airports, in global markets, and across capitals. US partners awoke to yet another example of the Trump administration seeing alliances as an afterthought. Suddenly Europe was America's scapegoat, while China was busy sending medical aid to Italy.

Populist responses can't solve this, the first universal crisis of the globalized world.

Everyone, everywhere will be, or has been, impacted by this. Neither the unified policies adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, nor the counterterror surveillance and military might of post 9/11 can stop the transfer of a virus so infective that science appears to struggle to gauge just yet how infective it is. We don't know how long it will last, or how many people it will kill and so that uncertainty is tearing up the algorithms that keep the global economy afloat.

Slowly getting sick is a population never larger, never better connected, living on a planet that never felt smaller. It is more than grossly unfortunate that its key superpower has reached for the tool most readily at hand to deal with this crisis, populism.

Those who use this moment to say it is proof there are too many of ""them, here,"" are perhaps at the same time proving an uncomfortable point: the way the world is connected now cannot easily be undone. Trump needs the supply chain into America to continue pumping the means for tax revenue and wealth, he just thinks he can switch off some of the people.

Those, including the US' national security advisor, who says China started it and covered it up, also have to confront the fact it was Europe, the US and even Iran's dependence on Chinese wealth -- tourists, students or engineers -- that spread it. We need each other's money.

Amid the chaos, there may be a moment for hope and education. Every nation is likely -- at this point, as far as we can tell -- dealing with the same strain of the virus. China's experience can tell us how bad it can get even when you are able to forcibly quarantine people; South Korea's what happens when a state marshals incredible transparency and testing; Italy when widespread and voluntary paralysis besets an entire nation; the United Kingdom what happens when you try to delay the spread. We can all teach the other lessons learned. For perhaps the first time since there have been billions of us, we all have a singular goal to share.

COVID-19 is also an existential challenge to the post-truth era. This illness infects quickly regardless of demographics, belief, wealth or skin color.

The facts about its spread, vaccine and mortality rate can't be lied away. It was science -- advances in communication, travel and technology -- that made the world so small that coronavirus could travel so fast. It will be the same science that defeats it and makes that smallness feel safe again.

Globalization left many behind, and made some unconscionably wealthy, others disgracefully poor. It also made humans, on average, richer, healthier and more peaceful than any time in our collective history.

Soon the blame game for transmission may get under way in earnest. The same populists who thought the UK being an island meant it was unlikely to be much of a COVID-19 threat to America, will continue to suggest the virus means globalization's free movements must end.

But keep one eye on the role shared experience and knowledge plays in bringing this pandemic to an end. On how Hong Kong teaches Italy. On how China sends help to Iran. On how the Koreas help each other.

Our interlaced world may have helped this spread. But that connection will likely bring it to an end. And the isolation we all feel in the gap in-between will make us appreciate for once how close we have all been.",Our connected world made coronavirus spread.

In February, the Brazilian fashion industry made global headlines. Donata Meirelles , then fashion director at Vogue Brazil, was celebrating her 50th birthday in the predominantly black city of Salvador, Bahia. During the celebration, journalist Fabio Bernardo snapped a photo of Meirelles, who is white, sitting in a traditional throne-like chair flanked by two baianas (Afro-Brazilian women wearing white lace gowns and headpieces), which he then shared on Instagram.

To many who saw the post (which has since been deleted), the scene evoked colonial Brazil, when white elites ruled over black slaves.

""What happened there is what happens in this country built on racism, bodies, sweat, blood and black tears,"" Afro-Brazilian actress and activist Tais Araujo, Vogue Brazil's November 2018 cover star, posted to her Instagram account in the days following the event. ""This suffering is so naturalized that it is difficult for people who do not identify with the girls standing by the chair to feel what the black population feels. Everything becomes natural.""

While the party was not an official Vogue event, the backlash was enough to warrant Meirelles' resignation from the title just a few days after the event, and a public apology from the magazine, who wrote on Instagram that they hoped the discussions sparked by the incident had ""served as a learning opportunity."" (Both Meirelles and Vogue Brazil declined to be interviewed for this story.)

And it has: On social media and beyond, the industry and the public have been having long overdue conversations about race and representation in Brazil's fashion community.

According to a Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics study released in 2016, 54% of Brazilians identify as black or multiracial. And yet black people have been all but erased from the mainstream fashion industry -- in front of the camera, on the catwalk and behind the scenes.

Historically, model diversity at SÃÂ£o Paulo Fashion Week has been so low that in 2009, following intense pressure from anti-racism activists and state prosecutors, the organizing body mandated that 10% of models in each show must be black.

At last edition of SÃÂ£o Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), which took place in April month, black models were still in the minority, and for the last three seasons, only one black designer -- Luiz Claudio of Apartamento 03 -- has participated. (SPFW CEO Paulo Borges told CNN that organizers are aware of the disparity and are discussing ways to bring in new players.)

Why model Leomie Anderson is fighting for change

""In a country where most of the population is black, it's troubling to think that fashion, one of the most important vehicles of cultural and social expression, excludes such large numbers of creators and consumers,"" Afro-Brazilian artist and fashion designer Carol Barreto, who teaches gender studies at the Federal University of Bahia, said in an email.

""The entertainment world is highly susceptible to reproducing stereotypes, so it's important to study the limits and latitudes imposed when dealing with questions of race,"" she continued, because the propagation of negative images can contribute to perceptions of Black people as inferior.

Juliano Corbetta, founder and editor-in-chief of the online menswear publication Made in Brazil, has witnessed how racial inequality in Brazil can affect a magazine financially.

In early 2018, Corbetta set out to publish an issue that was would feature predominantly black talent (including producers, photographers and models) to inspire ""16-year-old kids dreaming of breaking into a fashion career."" Though he had no trouble finding talent to fill the pages, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to secure the advertisements needed to fund the issue.

""Reality hit. For the first time in nine years in publishing, everyone declined. No one wanted to include this (magazine) in their 2019 plans,"" Corbetta said. Many brands, he claims, told him an all-black issue wouldn't resonate with their audience.

He connects the issue to the fact that, in Brazil, discussing race and racism is still widely taboo. ""We never talk about apartheid. We didn't have a Martin Luther King. We didn't have a Rosa Parks. We didn't have an actual militant anti-racism movement. We have never talked about prejudice, even though it exists, so brands don't talk about it either.""

In this landscape, Brazil's black creatives -- like many marginalized groups around the world -- are increasingly turning to the internet and social media to create spaces for themselves in response to a lack of mainstream opportunity.

This was the route taken by Luiza Brasil, a Rio de Janeiro-based influencer and columnist for the Brazilian edition of Glamour. In 2015, she created Mequetrefismos, an online fashion, beauty and lifestyle publication, to promote the work of black people working within those fields; and, as a curator for the Casa Ipanema lifestyle boutique in Rio, has brought brands runs by black women to the forefront.

""We see more black people featured on magazine covers and in advertisements for luxury stores, but who are the people behind these campaigns? (The fact that they are usually white) says a lot about the lack of black people in organizations and leadership roles,"" Brasil said in a WhatsApp message. ""The black population is in the majority -- at 54% -- but our narratives have always been constructed by white people.""

""I think the Afro-Brazilian (empowerment) movement has always existed, but it's always been invisible. With the help of the internet, the Afro-Brazilian movement has gained momentum.""

Kevin David, a 25-year-old based in SÃÂ£o Paulo, agrees. As executive creative director of MOOC , a Black-run creative collective, he's used the power of social media to land youth-oriented collaborative campaigns with the likes of Levi's, Converse, GQ Brazil and Schutz.

""There are fewer opportunities (for black creatives), but we are taking over. We have entered the market ... Weren't happy with the way the market was treating us,"" David said. ""We didn't want anyone else to tell our story. We wanted to take action and show that we believe representation means at this moment in Brazil.""

Brasil believes that the ongoing empowerment black creatives in the digital sphere will help challenge existing narratives and give Brazil more complex, diverse representations of black identity -- within Afro-Brazilian communities and in the mainstream.

""We no longer only represent an image of the ghetto, of blacks speaking only to blacks, but an important snapshot of society and our media in general"", she said.

939,http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/here-is-when-each-generation-begins-and-ends-according-to-facts/359589/,"I started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. Ã¢ÂÂWe do not define the different generations,Ã¢ÂÂ she told me. Ã¢ÂÂThe only generation we do define is Baby Boomers, and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964.Ã¢ÂÂ

Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. Ã¢ÂÂI think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media,Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete said, Ã¢ÂÂand the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation.Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It Ã¢ÂÂhad specific characteristics,Ã¢ÂÂ and occurred within an observable time frame. World War II ended. You had the postwar rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: Ã¢ÂÂHistory isnÃ¢ÂÂt always so punctuated.Ã¢ÂÂ

I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? DoesnÃ¢ÂÂt their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? Ã¢ÂÂI actually havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously,Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete said. The things that have shaped MillennialsÃ¢ÂÂthe rise of technology and social networks, for exampleÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂaffect peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives differently.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂThe media in particular wants definitions, identities,Ã¢ÂÂ DiPrete said. Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries Ã¢ÂÂ¦ At the end, I think it gets fuzzy.Ã¢ÂÂ

Well, yeah. We do want definitions. And if the media draws the boundaries, then allow us to do so definitively.

Your official demarcation of generational boundaries

We identified six different generations and labeled their eras.

Greatest Generation. These are the people who fought and died in World War II for our freedom, which we appreciate. But itÃ¢ÂÂs a little over-the-top as far as names go, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it? Tom Brokaw made the name up and of course everyone loved it. What, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to argue with your grandfather that he isnÃ¢ÂÂt in the greatest generation? The generation ended when the war ended.

Baby Boomers. This is the agreed-upon generation that falls within DiPreteÃ¢ÂÂs punctuated time frame. It began when the Greatest Generation got home and started having sex with everyone; it ended when having sex with everyone was made easier with the pill.

Generation X. George Masnick, of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, puts this generation in the time frame of 1965 to 1984, in part because itÃ¢ÂÂs a neat 20-year period. He also calls it the Ã¢ÂÂbaby bust,Ã¢ÂÂ mocking Ã¢ÂÂpundits on Madison Avenue and in the mediaÃ¢ÂÂ who call it Generation X.

There is cautious optimism in South Sudan that a newly formed unity government can finally bring peace following years of civil war.

What has also got people talking are the prominent roles women have been given, including Angelina Teny, who is now defence minister, the first woman to hold the position.

Ms Teny, who is also married to the former rebel leader and now first Vice-President Riek Machar, is not new to the security role.

While her husband has been under effective house arrest, first in South Africa and then Khartoum, she has been one of the opposition SPLM-IOÃ¢ÂÂs chief negotiators and led the groupÃ¢ÂÂs National Committee for Security and Defence.

She is a straight-talker and quick-thinker who has been one of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs most important politicians.

SheÃ¢ÂÂs previously served as state minister for energy and mining and after independence from Sudan, she led negotiations between the two countries on how to divide lucrative and contested oil assets.

More recently, she spent 17 months in the capital, Juba, after the signing of the recent peace deal working out security arrangements on how rebels and government forces could be merged.

Since her appointment some have questioned her qualifications to be defence minister.

There were hardly any customers there but the lobby and parking space were filled with security officials both in military fatigues and plain clothes.

The compromise the couple and their supporters made by coming back to the capital was to effectively hand over their personal security to their bitter rival, President Salva Kiir.

Favored by hardened yakuza gang members and law-abiding body art purists alike, large-scale Japanese tattoos are widely celebrated for their distinctive style, mythological motifs and vibrant coloring.

But while many of the common motifs are steeped in history and folklore, Japan's pictorial tattooing tradition is relatively new. Before the Edo period (c.1615-1868), tattoos were primarily used as crude markers of punishment for petty criminals or of fealty for lovers, or else the domain of the indigenous Ainu tribes of the northern islands.

According to ""Tattoos in Japanese Prints,"" a new publication from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it was only in the 19th century that they were elevated to the level of art.

Author Sarah E. Thompson, curator of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, traces their popularity back to the publication of ""One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin,"" a series of woodblock prints by the artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, between 1827 and 1830.

His prints, adapted from a 14th-century Chinese novel, saw bandit heroes covered with elaborate, full-body tattoos rendered in impressive detail. The common motifs -- dragons and demons, fearsome predators, koi fish and cherry blossoms -- were laden with meaning, and added another layer to the narrative.

Here he's depicted three actors in various roles, their tattoos meant to evoke characters from the books and plays of the day. Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston

""By emphasizing the tattoos sported by some of the heroes, Kuniyoshi's print designs not only exploited the allure of the exotic but also provided a titillating hint of the illicit -- especially if the suggestion that pictorial tattoos in Japan had been outlaws and spread to fashionable urbanites is correct,"" Thompson writes.

The impact of the ""Water Margin"" series and similar works from Kuniyoshi and his contemporaries was immediate and broad-reaching. Men across class lines requested tattoos of scenes from ""Water Margins"" -- and, in some cases, the characters' tattoos. Textile artists started incorporating tattoo-like prints into their designs; kabuki stars painted simple designs onto their skin for performances.

(The tattoos did have their detractors, however. In 1872, as Japan started its push toward Westernization, tattoos were banned by the Japanese government, who considered them uncivilized and old-fashioned. This ban was lifted after the American occupation after WWII.)

""It is uncertain whether Kuniyoshi was responding to a recent craze for extensive pictorial tattoos, or whether -- as suggested by oral tradition among present-day tattoo artists -- it was the prints themselves that inspired the new fashion,"" Thompson writes.

""Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between: large tattoos were already beginning to appear, but it was Kuniyoshi who transformed a temporary fad into a lasting art form.""",Deciphering the hidden meanings of Japanese tattoos,"Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNNFavored by hardened yakuza gang members and law-abiding body art purists alike, large-scale Japanese tattoos are widely celebrated for their distinctive style, mythological motifs and vibrant coloring.

612,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/13/middleeast/iran-coronavirus-mass-graves-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Iran has been rapidly expanding a major cemetery in Qom, the area worst hit by the country's novel coronavirus outbreak, satellite images obtained by CNN reveal.

The country has reported at least 10,075 confirmed coronavirus cases and 429 deaths, the third-highest number of cases after mainland China and Italy.

The satellite images from March 1 and March 8, put out by Maxar Technologies, appear to show an increase in activity inside the Behesht-e Masoumeh cemetery in Qom. The images show what looks like two fresh trenches of graves on March 1, with more excavation after that.

According to Islamic tradition, bodies are supposed to be buried quickly after death. But Behesht-e Masoumeh morgue director Ali Ramezani told Iranian state TV earlier this month that burials were being delayed as testing for the virus takes time. And while corpses are traditionally washed with soap and water before burial in Iran, two medical workers in Qom told CNN that in some cases precautions related to the outbreak are preventing staff from observing traditional Islamic guidelines for burial.

A video from the morgue showed dozens of bodies sheathed in black bags on the floor of an Iranian morgue, while workers in protective suits and masks busily walk among them.

The country has reported at least 10,075 confirmed coronavirus cases and 429 deaths, the third-highest number of cases after mainland China and Italy.
The satellite images from March 1 and March 8, put out by Maxar Technologies, appear to show an increase in activity inside the Behesht-e Masoumeh cemetery in Qom.
The images show what looks like two fresh trenches of graves on March 1, with more excavation after that.

A teenager was sent home from school after being caught selling shots of hand sanitiser to his fellow pupils at 50p a go, his family claimed.

His mother, Jenny Tompkins, from Leeds, posted a picture of him arriving home earlier after his entrepreneurial exploits at Dixons Unity Academy.

In a post on Facebook, she said it was hard to discipline her son when his ""dad called to say he was a legend"".

The school denied it had excluded any pupils for selling hand sanitiser.

Some respondents to the post, which was shared nearly 130,000 times, praised his efforts.

One said ""can't fault his logic"".

Others reminisced about selling cigarettes for ÃÂ£1 a go.

Someone else said: ""Bet he gets an A in economics.""

His mother, however, said she tried to be serious when the school called, and later when her son arrived home ""with a big grin on his face"".

She said this was made more difficult after she called his father at work, who responded by calling him ""a [expletive] legend"".

Her son plans to use the ÃÂ£9 he made to buy a kebab and a multipack of Doritos, she added.

In a statement, the school said: ""No pupil has ever been excluded for selling hand sanitiser"".

""The student in question was excluded for a separate and unrelated incident in line with academy behaviour policy.""

Earlier it was announced the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day.

Six patients with coronavirus have died in hospitals in the UK - the latest was a man in his early 80s in Watford who had underlying health conditions.

Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide ""momentum"" for its ""existing diversity and inclusion approach.""

The move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.

About two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to ""create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity."" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.

These announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.

These missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.

Hiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.

Teen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , ""why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?""

Another user wrote: ""white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.""

In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment ""is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.""

The brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.

From the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?

Fashion's new watchdogs

With designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.

Fashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.

Take the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million ""Dieters"") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.

Social media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.

But controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

The industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, ""and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown"" in marketing materials. ""It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.""

Meanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw ""coolie"" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's ""New Look"" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.

Sales of the YSL perfume ""Opium"" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.

""We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,"" Steele said in a phone interview. ""How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.""

While the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.

""The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,"" Steele added. ""Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.""

Why brands miss the mark

Whether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.

This is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.

Here, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as ""creepy"" by social media users.

Fashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.

This raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.

Former Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like ChloÃÂ©, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.

She believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.

""These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.

""With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,"" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. ""Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.""

Tapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the HermÃÂ¨s-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.

More than money

There is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.

The D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.

Dolce & Gabbana forced to cancel show in China

If more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. ""Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,"" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and ""in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.""

""You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,"" she said. ""You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.""

Steele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.

And the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.

""Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,"" said Steele.

""On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.""

This pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.

""Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.""

Steps toward accountability

Brands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.

In January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.

""The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,"" the briefing stated. ""It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.""

As the report articulated, diversity is ""simply a measure of difference"" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating ""a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole."" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.

The current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.

The industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.

Remedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.

While no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will ""elevate voices of color.""

And when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund ""to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)

Burberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.

But they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.

At the time of publication, D&G, Dior and Saint Laurent had not responded to CNN's request for comment.",Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Fashion brand Burberry apologized for showcasing a hoodie that featured a noose around the neck during its show at London Fashion Week.

59,https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/11/entertainment/hot-zone-containment-doomsday-preppers/index.html,"(CNN) This weekend, I cleaned the floors of my home with a diluted bleach solution and developed a protocol for entering my home from the outside world that was inspired by decontamination chambers I've seen in TV shows.

To be clear, you don't have to put these procedures into place due to the coronavirus pandemic. The best defense is actually washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds and not touching your face.

But I am, to be frank, a bit of a germaphobe, who instituted a similarly strict approach to cleanliness after our home got hit particularly hard from the flu this year. (Clearly, we run a party home; over for brunch, sometime!)

I've discovered over time -- and through some serious therapy, in case you're wonder -- that I am someone that prefers to stare my anxieties right in the face. (Note: If you prefer to do the opposite, I made a list for you, too.)

When I was stressed over planning my wedding, I watched hours of wedding-related television , including every episode of ""Four Weddings."" When a bunch of people I knew confronted serious medical issues just weeks apart, I binge watched ""ER.""

As fears over coronavirus have affected daily life, a stare-off with my paranoia has begun. These are some of the shows I've been watching:

""Containment""

'Containment'

This CW limited series about a mysterious outbreak checked all the boxes of both a good pandemic story (graphic depictions of illness) and the things you'd come to the CW for (romances tested by extreme circumstances). The show managed a mildly satisfying conclusion despite the network deciding the story was best, um, contained to one season.

Why watch it? It's a good option if you're tired of watching "" It's a good option if you're tired of watching "" Contagion .""

""Kitchen Nightmares""

Gordon Ramsey hosts 'Kitchen Nightmares'

This show doesn't directly have to do with an outbreak, but let me tell you, dirty commercial kitchens are a pandemic in need of eradicating. Luckily, chef Gordon Ramsey is on the case. If you're trying to inspire yourself to do a good cleaning of your kitchen, there is no better inspiration out there than looking at the horrors contained inside poorly maintained walk-in freezers.

Why watch it? You might be inspired to eat in, limiting your exposure to a number of ailments.

""The Hot Zone""

Dr. Nancy Jaax (Julianna Margulies) works in her pathology lab in an episode of ""The Hot Zone."" (National Geographic/Amanda Matlovich)

Julianna Margulies starred in this 6-episode limited series for National Geographic based on the book of the same name. In the series, an Army scientist (Marguilies) works to contain an Ebola outbreak in the nation's capital. The opening moments, like the book, are graphic and horrifying as a sick airplane passenger sets the scene. It's truly the stuff of nightmares, if you're into that sort of thing.

Why watch it? It's educational. But be warned: you may develop a fear of monkeys.

It's available On Demand.

""Doomsday Preppers""

'Doomsday'

Even those of us who have a well-stocked earthquake kit -- or similar emergency supplies, depending on the threats in the area you live Ã¢ÂÂ will feel ill prepared watching the people featured on this National Geographic series. Over four seasons, viewers were introduced to people preparing for all sorts of disasters, from earthquakes and economic collapse to, yes, pandemics

Why watch it? You may walk away with a desire to up your prep game.

""Hoarders""

'Hoarders'

Look, there's being prepared and then there's going too far. Yes, I'm looking at you, woman in line at Ralph's with four 12 packs of toilet paper.

Why watch it? This show might inspire you to take much-needed chill pill if you've in the last week cleaned out the cleaning aisle of your local Target.

Not a TV show: ""As Good As It Gets""

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. Ã¢ÂÂ Eeriness is the prevailing condition right now throughout spring training camps.

What do you do when you have no idea what's coming next?

""Oh, man,"" San Francisco Giants outfielder Alex Dickerson quipped Wednesday morning on his way out to the fields. ""This is where they've quarantined all of you?""

Four or five of us reporters were lined up against the wall outside of the Giants clubhouse under a narrow overhang, attempting to stay dry during a heavy rain. It wasn't actually a ""quarantine"" situation. But with media and anyone who isn't a player or ""essential employee"" currently barred from clubhouses as Major League Baseball and pretty much everyone else work to address the coronavirus pandemic, suddenly nobody is quite sure where to go or even how the game gets back to normal.

On the back fields over at the Chicago White Sox camp in Glendale, Arizona, on Tuesday, two players were about to take a golf cart over to the clubhouse following a morning workout when star shortstop Tim Anderson hitched a ride, standing on the back of the cart, where the clubs normally go. As they drove on a pathway with dozens of fans behind fences on either side, Anderson smiled wide and called out to them: ""Wash your hands! Wash your hands!""

Then, past the fans, Anderson kept hollering the same advice to random teammates too.

Every day brings more alarming news about COVID-19. Every hour delivers more unwelcome changes, decisions made to slow transmission rates of the virus.

About the time Dickerson kidded us reporters, San Francisco mayor London Breed was announcing that large public events with 1,000 or more people in attendance would be prohibited in the city. Shortly afterward, the Giants announced their March 24 Bay Bridge Series home game against Oakland would not take place, though alternate arrangements have not yet been announced. On Thursday, MLB announced that the remainder of spring training would be canceled for all teams and the regular season moved back by at least two weeks.

""You have to trust the higher powers who are making these decisions that are more informed than all of us are,"" Giants catcher Buster Posey said. ""Just roll with it. Do what you do for the time being. Hopefully you put your trust in people who are making good decisions for the whole.""

At Cincinnati's camp in Goodyear, Arizona, the Reds advised their players to avoid signing autographs, shaking hands or having any other kind of personal interactions with fans. To most players, that's a foreign concept at this time of year.

Baseball lifers are fond of repeating that the best thing about the game is that every single day you have a chance to see something you've never seen before.

Well, nobody has ever seen anything like this.

Walking into the White Sox complex early the other morning, it was impossible not to be overcome by the strangest of feelings: For the first time in memory, the clubhouse was off-limits to those chronicling the game.

When Sox manager Rick Renteria met the media outside later that morning, he sat at a picnic table, and a team media relations staffer asked the group to keep ""a safe distance"" from Renteria. As recommended to all clubs by MLB, in group settings, a distance of six feet of separation should be maintained until further notice. In one-on-one interviews, regular conversational distance is OK. The varying logistics feel awkward and a work in progress.

At the end of a long conversation with budding White Sox ace Lucas Giolito, I started to offer a handÃ¢ÂÂthen clumsily pulled back as Giolito extended his. I asked whether he was still a hand-shaker, and he said yes. So we shook.

In this atmosphere, both in baseball and, clearly, beyond, we are all rethinking even the most natural and mundane of movements.

It's difficult and uncomfortable for all.

Or, as third baseman Kris Bryant exclaimed Wednesday upon driving back to Cubs camp in Mesa, Arizona, from his Las Vegas home and an ultrasound appointment with his pregnant wife (""Everything's good""): ""This is really weird. This is really strange.""

He was sitting behind a microphone at a table in the team's media workroom, with the various reporters and camerapeople in a half-circle in front of him, yes, six feet or so back.

""We're all willing to accept what's keeping us safe and what's keeping everyone else safe,"" Bryant said. ""The situation is not ideal, but we'll work through it.

""I think we all need to take precautions. I have a lot of family members who are older, too, and I'd like to keep them safe.""

Before Thursday's announcement, spring training attendance hadn't seemed overly affected. Attendance is down a tick, but most people around the game believe it was because spring games are being played earlier in the month because of the previously scheduled March 26 Opening Day.

Everyone is cooperating in these first, awkward days. Team PR departments are bringing players, as requested, out of the clubhouse for interviews, and reporters are keeping their distance.

But it's not just the media coverage of the game that has been altered. Those who have been deemed nonessential personnel for the purposes of these protocols and disallowed from clubhouses include shoe representatives, bat reps, sunglass salespersonsÃ¢ÂÂall of the various roving equipment and fashion folks who weave their ways through camps each spring, supplying players with the latest goods and making money themselves.

Spring camps feel emptier now. It can be unsettling. And the players aren't necessarily enjoying the space and quiet.

""It's [not] something we're used to,"" Posey said. ""But at the same time, back to my first point, we roll with it for now and hopefully it's one of those things where we're back to normal sooner rather than later.""

When that will be, nobody has a clue. The Mariners announced that a season-opening seven-game homestand against Texas and Minnesota later this month will be moved out of Seattle. Across sports, the impact is being felt. And in addition to the NBA suspending its season Wednesday, the NCAA has canceled its men's and women's basketball tournaments, and the NHL announced Thursday that its regular season would be paused.

Opening Day is now four weeks awayÃ¢ÂÂ¦or is it? That question is still very much up in the air.

And while the new restrictions may not seem onerous, they are sure to have impacts on the coverage of the game once play resumes. Clubhouse access is vital to gaining the kind of intimacy with players that allow them the comfort to reveal something of themselves beyond the numbers and the highlights. It allows them to show their humanity.

Cincinnati Reds first baseman Joey Votto explained the importance of proximity between the media and players when he was asked in an interview with Cincinnati reporters about whether there is value in having media members in the clubhouse.

""I'd say a vast majority of the stories involve nuance, emotion, personal relationships,"" Votto said, according to Bobby Nightengale of the Cincinnati Enquirer. ""Even if they are incorrect, a perception of how someone reacted or how a player reacted can be told in a facial expression or getting to know that person and tone.

""I think if you don't have that on a daily basis, you don't get to share those insights and, frankly, most fans don't care about the balls and strikes, runs and winsÃ¢ÂÂwell, I guess wins. They care about the person. They want to feel like they are close to the performer in any sport. I think that everyone in the media is the bridge that connects the athlete to the public. Without that close proximity, I personally don't think that you get that very human component.""

Clearly, the stakes for humanity right now are far greater than determinations of whether nonessential personnel are admitted to baseball clubhouses or whether games are played in empty stadiums or whether the games are even played at all. Chicago Cubs pitcher Yu Darvish was concerned enough about a looming pandemic that he spoke with club officials as soon as he arrived in Arizona last month and canceled a couple of public appearances over the winter, including one for which he agreed to pay a $10,000 cancellation fee.

As this all plays out in directions few could have imagined as recently as a week or two ago, we can only hope lives are protected, infections are contained and normalcy returns for all soon. In schools, at offices and, yes, in arenas and stadiums.

""People need to be considerate toward each other,"" Bryant reiterated. Citing advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to scrub hands for a minimum of 20 seconds, he said, ""Wash your hands. Sing 'Happy Birthday' twice. Sing 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame.'

""Sing whatever song you want. Just be considerate.""

244,https://us.cnn.com/2016/12/11/world/vanishing-mckenzie-botswana-elephants/index.html,"At least that's how I remember it. I was 7.

I'm wedged between a cousin and my father, my grandmother perched behind. We are in the back of an open pickup near the banks of the Olifants River in South Africa.

""Drive!"" we shout at my uncle in the cab, banging on the roof.

But banging on the roof is our signal to stop.

The truck stops and the elephant is right behind us. We can see the milk discharging from her teats. Her newborn is somewhere hidden in the bushes.

My dad pulls out an antique double-barreled shotgun. He loads it with birdshot to fire in the air.

""Don't shoot the elephant,"" my gran cries and smacks him.

It would be like shooting an elephant with a tic-tac.

I am crying, and so is my cousin. We smell the elephant musk; we can see the horizon through its legs.

My uncle sees the elephant looming in his rearview mirror. He hits the accelerator.

Outrunning the charging animal, we bounce along the dirt track. Shortly after, she turns back.

We are safe. Right around the corner, the truck's axle breaks in an aardvark hole.

My family often recounts this story. And from that incident, I learned elephants had to be respected -- even feared.

It means no worries

Imagine my alarm, then, nearly 30 years later, when I am assigned by CNN to a story in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.

The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.

The guide drives right up to a breeding herd of elephants in the grasslands and promptly switches off the engine.

""Shouldn't we keep it on,"" I say, ""and maybe not be so close.""

""The elephants here are relaxed,"" he smiles, ""Hakuna Matata.""

Meaning: ""No worries.""

I can't understand it. The elephants don't charge. They do not seem agitated, as has been my experience. They completely ignore us.

To be sure, elephants can be dangerous -- and sometimes deadly. But in this section of the Mara, there hasn't been hunting for decades. They are used to the tourist vehicles.

The game farm from my childhood near Olifants bordered a hunting reserve to the west. At the time, they still culled elephants in Kruger National Park to the east.

The elephants knew.

""Elephants have a cognitive sense of where they are safe and where they are at risk,"" Mike Chase, the lead scientist on the Great Elephant Census, told me on a recent trip to Botswana, where he's been tracking elephant movements for years. The census is a pioneering pan-African aerial survey that aims to count the continent's savanna elephant populations.

""This is really the front line, this is as far as they come, they will no longer move across eastern Namibia into Angola and Zambia, fearful of the consequences of poaching,"" says Chase.

As poaching rises, the elephants know to stay away.

And they remember.

No, they don't forget

It's sometimes tempting to anthropomorphize -- to give an animal human characteristics -- but the more I speak to people about elephants, the more elephants seem special.

I met up with Chase with Ingrid Formanek, one of CNN's most experienced field producers.

Ingrid's connection to Botswana runs deep.

In 1999 she moved to Maun, on the doorstep of the Okavango Delta, to document the rehabilitation of elephants. She lived there on and off for five years.

She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. Ingrid Formanek, CNN

Ingrid recounts the story of an elephant orphaned in the Kruger culls, called Shireni.

Shireni's handler taught her a trick: to remove her handler's hat with her trunk and to put it on her own head and then to put it back on her handler's. Ingrid observed as the elephant learned the behavior.

Nearly a decade later, Ingrid went back and saw Shireni.

""She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. She made the link to that time in our lives,"" says Ingrid. """"Shireni hadn't done that in all the interim years. I was amazed, and truth be told, flattered.""

Anybody who has studied or worked with elephants has their own stories about how sharp elephant memories are.

Experts like Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has rescued hundreds of orphaned calves, talks about elephants remembering people years later, and the things that happened to them -- good and bad.

Sheldrick speaks of elephants reintroduced to the wild who have returned years, sometimes decades, later for help with an injury or just to say ""hello.""

Vanishing herds

Despite their obvious emotional intelligence and survival instincts, elephants can't escape the ravages of humans.

Elephants are slaughtered by poachers who seek their ivory tusks.

Before European colonization, scientists believe that Africa may have held as many as 20 million elephants; by 1979 only 1.3 million remained -- and the Great Elephant Census revealed this year that things have gotten far worse.

In the seven years between 2007 and 2014, numbers plummeted by at least 30%, or 144,000 elephants.

As of July, Africa's savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census . Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.

And the specific cases are even more disturbing: In the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, elephant populations have plummeted by more than 75% in the past 10 years as poachers cut down family herds, according to the survey.

""When you think of how many elephants occurred in areas 10 or 20 years ago, it's incredibly disheartening,"" says Chase.

""Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.""

In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe. It was part of southern Africa's ""haven"" that comprises 60% of all savannah elephants counted in the census.

But the ivory poaching wars, driven primarily by Asian demand, are on its doorstep.

Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted. Mike Chase, Great Elephant Census

Botswana is fighting an unconventional war to try to stop the slaughter, with the Botswana Defense Force mobilized throughout the border region.

More than 700 specially trained soldiers are stationed in 40 bases in the far north.

That protection no longer seems enough.

A new memory

From a distance, it appears the elephant could be resting. But the smell reveals the truth.

A once glorious bull lies lifeless in a dry section of the Linyanti swamp in Botswana. His face hacked off by poachers.

As we approach, we see the tusks have been taken. The trunk is 10 paces from the body. The carcass is perhaps two or three days old. And it is just one of more than 20 we have counted in Linyanti in just over 48 hours.

Now, with current rates of poaching, they will be wiped out from some of their range states.

They could even go locally extinct, says Chase.

""I've been asked if I'm optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Africa's elephants,"" he says, ""and on days like today, I feel that we are failing the elephants.""

This horrific scene could be the only way we remember them.",'We are failing the elephants',"The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.

1058,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html,"The young mothers didnÃ¢ÂÂt tell their children they had the coronavirus. Mama was working hard, they said, to save sick people. Instead, Deng Danjing and Xia Sisi were fighting for their lives in the same hospitals where they worked, weak from fever and gasping for breath. Within a matter of weeks, they had gone from healthy medical professionals on the front lines of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, to coronavirus patients in critical condition. The world is still struggling to fully understand the new virus, its symptoms, spread and sources. For some, it can feel like a common cold. For others, it is a deadly infection that ravages the lungs and pushes the immune system into overdrive, destroying even healthy cells. The difference between life and death can depend on the patientÃ¢ÂÂs health, age and access to care Ã¢ÂÂ although not always. The virus has infected more than 132,000 globally. The vast majority of cases have been mild, with limited symptoms. But the virusÃ¢ÂÂs progression can be quick, at which point the chances of survival plummet. Around 68,000 people have recovered, while nearly 5,000 have died. The fates of Ms. Deng and Dr. Xia reflect the unpredictable nature of a virus that affects everyone differently, at times defying statistical averages and scientific research. As the new year opened in China, the women were leading remarkably similar lives. Both were 29 years old. Both were married, each with a young child on whom she doted. Ms. Deng, a nurse, had worked for three years at Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, in the city where she grew up and where the coronavirus pandemic began. Her mother was a nurse there, too, and in their free time they watched movies or shopped together. Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs favorite activity was playing with her two pet kittens, Fat Tiger and Little White, the second of which she had rescued just three months before falling sick. Before the epidemic, Ms. Deng had promised to take her 5-year-old daughter to the aquarium. Dr. Xia, a gastroenterologist, also came from a family of medical professionals. As a young child, she had accompanied her mother, a nurse, to work. She joined the Union Jiangbei Hospital of Wuhan in 2015 and was the youngest doctor in her department. Her colleagues called her Ã¢ÂÂLittle SisiÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂLittle SweetieÃ¢ÂÂ because she always had a smile for them. She loved Sichuan hot pot, a dish famous for its numbingly spicy broth. Dr. Xia loved traveling with her family. She had recently visited Wuzhizhou Island, a resort destination off the southern coast of China. When a mysterious new virus struck the city, the women began working long hours, treating a seemingly endless flood of patients. They took precautions to protect themselves. But they succumbed to the infection, the highly contagious virus burrowing deep into their lungs, causing fever and pneumonia. In the hospital, each took a turn for the worse. One recovered. One did not.

Symptoms Onset of virus & hospitalization Ms. Deng, a Wuhan native who liked makeup and hanging out with her friends at Starbucks, had worked for eight years as a nurse, following her motherÃ¢ÂÂs career path. Dr. Xia, who was a favorite among elderly patients, spent long hours at the hospital helping to treat people suspected of having the virus. The symptoms came on suddenly. Dr. Xia had ended her night shift on Jan. 14 when she was called back to attend to a patient Ã¢ÂÂ a 76-year-old man with suspected coronavirus. She dropped in frequently to check in on him. Five days later, she started feeling unwell. Exhausted, she took a two-hour nap at home, then checked her temperature: It was 102 degrees. Her chest felt tight. A few weeks later, in early February, Ms. Deng, the nurse, was preparing to eat dinner at the hospital office, when the sight of food left her nauseated. She brushed the feeling aside, figuring she was worn out by work. She had spent the beginning of the outbreak visiting the families of confirmed patients and teaching them to disinfect their homes. After forcing down some food, Ms. Deng went home to shower, and then, feeling groggy, took a nap. When she woke up, her temperature was 100 degrees. Fever is the most common symptom of the coronavirus, seen in nearly 90 percent of patients. About a fifth of people experience shortness of breath, often including a cough and congestion. Many also feel fatigued. Both women rushed to see doctors. Chest scans showed damage to their lungs, a tell-tale sign of the coronavirus that is present in at least 85 percent of patients, according to one study. In particular, Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs CT scan showed what the doctor called ground-glass opacities on her lower right lung Ã¢ÂÂ hazy spots that indicated fluid or inflammation around her airways. The hospital had no space, so Ms. Deng checked into a hotel to avoid infecting her husband and 5-year-old daughter. She sweated through the night. At one point, her calf twitched. In the morning, she was admitted to the hospital. Her throat was swabbed for a genetic test, which confirmed she had the coronavirus. Her room in a newly opened staff ward was small, with two cots and a number assigned to each one. Ms. Deng was in bed 28. Her roommate was a colleague who had also been diagnosed with the virus. At Jiangbei Hospital, 18 miles away, Dr. Xia was struggling to breathe. She was placed in an isolation ward, treated by doctors and nurses who wore protective suits and safety goggles. The room was cold.

Treatment Day 1, hospitalization begins After Ms. Deng was admitted to the hospital, she told her husband to take care of himself, reminding him of the 14-day incubation period for the virus. He assured her his temperature was normal. Dr. Xia asked her husband about the possibility of getting off oxygen therapy soon. He responded optimistically. When Ms. Deng checked into the hospital, she tried to stay upbeat. She texted her husband, urging him to wear a mask even at home, and to clean all their bowls and chopsticks with boiling water or throw them out. Her husband sent a photograph of one of their cats at home. Ã¢ÂÂWaiting for you to come back,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂI think itÃ¢ÂÂll take 10 days, half a month,Ã¢ÂÂ she replied. Ã¢ÂÂTake care of yourself.Ã¢ÂÂ There is no known cure for Covid-19, the official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. So doctors rely on a cocktail of other medicines, mostly antiviral drugs, to alleviate the symptoms. Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs doctor prescribed a regimen of arbidol, an antiviral medicine used to treat the flu in Russia and China; Tamiflu, another flu medicine more popular internationally; and Kaletra, an HIV medicine thought to block the replication of the virus. Ms. Deng was taking at least 12 pills a day, as well as traditional Chinese medicine. Arbidol, an antiviral medication, was prescribed to help alleviate Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs symptoms. Despite her optimism, she grew weaker. Her mother delivered home-cooked food outside the ward, but she had no appetite. To feed her, a nurse had to come at 8:30 each morning to hook her up to an intravenous drip with nutrients. Another drip pumped antibodies into her bloodstream, and still another antiviral medicine. Dr. Xia, too, was severely ill, but appeared to be slowly fighting the infection. Her fever had subsided after a few days, and she began to breathe more easily after being attached to a ventilator. Her spirits lifted. On Jan. 25, she told her colleagues she was recovering. Ã¢ÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂªÃ°ÂÂÂª I will return to the team soon,Ã¢ÂÂ she texted them on WeChat. Ã¢ÂÂWe need you the most,Ã¢ÂÂ one of her colleagues responded. In early February, Dr. Xia asked her husband, Wu Shilei, also a doctor, whether he thought she could get off oxygen therapy soon. Ã¢ÂÂTake it easy. DonÃ¢ÂÂt be too anxious,Ã¢ÂÂ he replied on WeChat. He told her that the ventilator could possibly be removed by the following week. Ã¢ÂÂI keep on thinking about getting better soon,Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Xia responded. There was reason to believe she was on the mend. After all, most coronavirus patients recover. Later, Dr. Xia tested negative twice for the coronavirus. She told her mother she expected to be discharged on Feb. 8.

Decline Day 4 to 16 after hospitalization In the hospital, Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs only contacts were her roommate and the medical staff. She added a caption to a photo with her doctor, saying laughter would help chase the illness away. Two tests indicated that Dr. Xia was free of the virus, but her condition suddenly deteriorated. By Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs fourth day in the hospital, she could no longer pretend to be cheerful. She was vomiting, having diarrhea and relentlessly shivering. Her fever jumped to 101.3 degrees. Early in the morning on Feb. 5, she woke from a fitful sleep to find the medicine had done nothing to lower her temperature. She cried. She said she was classified as critically ill. The next day, she threw up three times, until she was left spitting white bubbles. She felt she was hallucinating. She could not smell or taste, and her heart rate slowed to about 50 beats per minute. On a phone call, Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs mother tried to reassure her that she was young and otherwise healthy, and that the virus would pass like a bad cold. But Ms. Deng feared otherwise. Ã¢ÂÂI felt like I was walking on the edge of death,Ã¢ÂÂ she wrote in a social media post from her hospital bed the next day. China defines a critically ill patient as someone with respiratory failure, shock or organ failure. Around 5 percent of infected patients became critical in China, according to one of the largest studies to date of coronavirus cases. Of those, 49 percent died. (Those rates may eventually change once more cases are examined around the world.) While Dr. Xia appeared to be recovering, she was still terrified of dying. Testing can be faulty, and negative results donÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily mean patients are in the clear. She asked her mother for a promise: Could her parents look after her 2-year-old son if she didnÃ¢ÂÂt make it? Hoping to dispel her anxiety with humor, her mother, Jiang Wenyan, chided her: Ã¢ÂÂHeÃ¢ÂÂs your own son. DonÃ¢ÂÂt you want to raise him yourself?Ã¢ÂÂ Dr. Xia also worried about her husband. Over video chat, she urged him to put on protective equipment at the hospital where he worked. Ã¢ÂÂShe said she would wait for me to return safely,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, Ã¢ÂÂand go to the frontline again with me when she recovered.Ã¢ÂÂ Then came the call. Dr. XiaÃ¢ÂÂs condition had suddenly deteriorated. In the early hours of Feb. 7, her husband rushed to the emergency room. Her heart had stopped.

Recovery Day 17 after hospitalization After being discharged, Ms. Deng briefly got to see her mother, who had been working at the hospital during her illness. She then went home to isolate herself for two weeks. In most cases, the body repairs itself. The immune system produces enough antibodies to clear the virus, and the patient recovers. By the end of Ms. DengÃ¢ÂÂs first week in the hospital, her fever had receded. She could eat the food her mother delivered. On Feb. 10, as her appetite returned, she looked up photos of meat skewers online and posted them wishfully to social media. On Feb. 15, her throat swab came back negative for the virus. Three days later, she tested negative again. She could go home. Ms. Deng met her mother briefly at the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs entrance. Then, because Wuhan remained locked down, without taxis or public transportation, she walked home alone. Ã¢ÂÂI felt like a little bird,Ã¢ÂÂ she recalled. Ã¢ÂÂMy freedom had been returned to me.Ã¢ÂÂ She had to isolate at home for 14 days. Her husband and daughter stayed with her parents. At home, she threw out her clothing, which she had been wearing for her entire time in the hospital. Since then, she has passed the time by playing with her cats and watching television. She jokes that she is getting an early taste of retirement. She does daily deep breathing exercises to strengthen her lungs, and her cough has faded. The Chinese government has urged recovered patients to donate plasma, which experts say contains antibodies that could be used to treat the sick. Ms. Deng contacted a local blood bank soon after getting home. She plans to go back to work as soon as the hospital allows it. Ã¢ÂÂIt was the nation that saved me,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂAnd I think I can pay it back to the nation.Ã¢ÂÂ",Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus.
